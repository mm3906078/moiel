HANLEY:
Murph is a great kid. She's really bright.

171
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,702
But she's been having a little trouble lately.

172
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:45,247
She brought this in to show the students.
The section on the lunar landings.

173
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,917
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.

174

She always loved the pictures.

175
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:54,256
It's an old federal textbook. We've
replaced them with the corrected versions.

You don't believe we went to the moon'?

179
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,565
It was a brilliant piece of propaganda.

180
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:14,568
The Soviets bankrupted themselves
pouring resources...

181
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,987
...into rockets and other useless machines.

182
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,239
"Useless machines."

183

If we don't want a repeat of the excess
and wastefulness of the 20th century, then...

...we need to teach our kids about this planet,
not tales of leaving it.

185
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:31,293
One of those useless machines
they used to make was called an MRI.

186
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:35,005
If we had any of those left,
the doctors would've been able to find...

187
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:38,926
...the cyst in my wife's brain
before she died instead of afterwards.

188
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:42,179
Then she'd have been the one
listening to this instead of me...

189
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:45,432
...which would have been a good thing,
because she was always...

190
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,518

00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:25,379
And one system shows promise.

470
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:28,257
One. That's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?

471
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:31,928
One system with three potential worlds?

472
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:33,930
No long shot.

473
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,225
Okay.

474
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:40,269
So if we find a home...

475
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:46,400
...then what?
-That's the long shot.

476
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:49,946
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

477
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:53,407
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

478
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:08,047
COOPER:
This entire facility's a centrifuge.

479
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:10,883
Some kind of vehicle. A space station?

480
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:12,969
BRAND:
Both. Plan A.

481
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:15,221
How do you get it off the ground?

482
00:34:15,388 --> 00:34:19,058
The first gravitational anomalies
changed everything.

483
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:23,729
Suddenly we knew
that harnessing gravity was real.

484
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:28,734
So I started working on a theory
and we started building this station.

485
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,195
But you haven't solved it yet.

486
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,823
That's why there's Plan B.

487
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:39,036
The problem is gravity. How to get
a viable amount of human life off the planet.

488
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:40,496
This is one way.

489
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,332
Plan B: a population bomb.

490
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:48,421
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

491
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,631
How would you raise them?

492
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,259
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

493
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:57,305
After that, with surrogacy,
the growth becomes exponential.

494
00:34:58,014 --> 00:35:01,309
Within 30 years,
we could have a colony of hundreds.

495
00:35:01,475 --> 00:35:04,854
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

496
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,023
This takes care of that.

497
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,650
But what about the people here? You just...

498
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:11,360
...give up on them?

499
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:13,237
My kids?

500
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:17,116
That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

501
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:22,246
- How far have you got?
-Almost there.

502
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:24,832
You're asking me to hang everything...

503
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,209
...on an almost.

504
00:35:27,752 --> 00:35:30,046
I'm asking you to trust me.

505
00:35:31,756 --> 00:35:32,965
[SIGHS]

506
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:34,800
Find us a new home.

507
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:37,553
And by the time you return...

508
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:40,806
...l will have solved the problem of gravity.

509
00:35:41,766 --> 00:35:43,351
I give you my word.

510
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:57,490
MURPH:
Go away!

511
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:09,210
Murph.

512
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:12,588
MURPH:
Go! If you're leaving, just go.

513
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:18,219
DONALD: This world was never enough
for you, was it, Coop?

514
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:22,807
What, because heading out there
is what I feel like I was born to do?

515
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:25,601
And it excites me? Heh.

516
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,771
No, that does not make it wrong.

517
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:30,064
It might.

518
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:33,567
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

519
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:36,654
The why of the thing, that's the foundation.

520
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:38,906
And the foundation's solid.

521
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:47,081
We farmers, we sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say:

522
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:48,624
"Next year."

523
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,962
Well, next year ain't gonna save us,
nor the one after that.

524
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:57,925
This world's a treasure, Donald,
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.

525
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:06,434
Mankind was born on Earth,
it was never meant to die here.

526
00:37:09,562 --> 00:37:12,773
Torn will be all right,
but you got to make things right with Murph.

527
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,983
I Will.

528
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:18,112
Without making promises
you don't know you can keep.

529
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:30,750
You have to talk to me, Murph.

530
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:35,379
I need to fix this before I go.

531
00:37:35,546 --> 00:37:38,424
MURPH:
Then I'll keep it broken so you have to stay.

532
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:45,014
After you kids came along, your mom said
something to me I never quite understood.

533
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:47,016
She said, "Now...

534
00:37:48,893 --> 00:37:53,397
...we're just here
to be memories for our kids."

535
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:01,030
And I think that now I understand
what she meant.

536
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:08,537
Once you're a parent,
you're the ghost of your children's future.

537
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:12,333
You said ghosts didn't exist.

538
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:20,299
That's right, Murph.

539
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:24,845
Murph, look at me.

540
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,392
I can't be your ghost right now.

541
00:38:32,186 --> 00:38:34,188
I need to exist.

542
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:37,733
They chose me.

543
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:42,404
Murph, they chose me. You saw.
You're the one who led me to them.

544
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:47,535
That's exactly why you can't go.

545
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:52,706
I figured out the message.

546
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:56,335
- One word. Know what it is?
-Murph.

547
00:38:56,502 --> 00:38:57,837
"Stay. II

548
00:38:58,212 --> 00:39:01,090
- It says, "Stay," Dad.
-Murph.

549
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:03,509
You don't believe me.

550
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:06,470
Look at the books! Look at this.
It says, "Stay."

551
00:39:06,637 --> 00:39:09,598
Why--? You're not listening! It says, "Stay!"

552
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:11,767
No, I'm coming back.

553
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:13,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">When'?</font>

554
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:28,742
One for you, one for me.

555
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:32,288
When I'm up there in hypersleep, or...

556
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:35,165
...traveling near the speed of light, or...

557
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,294
...near a black hole...

558
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:43,299
...time's gonna change for me.
It's gonna run more slowly.

559
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:46,677
When we get back...

560
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:49,221
...we're gonna compare.

561
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:52,016
MURPH: Time will run differently for us?
-Yeah.

562
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:57,771
By the time I get back,
we might even be the same age, you and me.

563
00:39:58,147 --> 00:40:00,482
"What?" Imagine that!

564
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:06,196
Aw, Murph...

565
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:08,991
You have no idea when you're coming back.

566
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:12,286
No idea at all!

567
00:40:15,414 --> 00:40:17,541
Murph, don't-- Don't make me leave like this.

568
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:19,209
Come on, Murph!

569
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,046
Don't make me leave like this, Murph!

570
00:40:29,637 --> 00:40:30,679
Hey...

571
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:32,556
...l love you.

572
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:34,850
Forever. You hear me?

573
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:38,520
I love you forever, and I'm coming back.

574
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:45,653
I'm coming back.

575
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:06,048
- How'd it go?
-Fine.

576
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:08,258
Just fine.

577
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:15,849
I love you, Tom.

578
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:18,519
- Travel safe, huh?
-Yeah.

579
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:20,938
You look after our place for me, all right?

580
00:41:21,105 --> 00:41:22,731
- All right?
-Uh-huh.

581
00:41:27,236 --> 00:41:30,614
- Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?
-You mean your truck?

582
00:41:32,116 --> 00:41:33,742
I'll make sure they bring it back.

583
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,663
Look after my kids, Donald!

584

There is Mach 1.

00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:49,318
Everybody good?
Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?

600
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:54,490
They gave him a humor setting
so he'd fit in better with his unit.

601
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:56,492
He thinks it relaxes us.

602

That'd probably help.

You can use it to find your way back
to the ship after I blow you out the airlock.

-That's 100 percent.

Pull thrusters back.

- We should learn to talk.
-And when not to.

00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:24,246
Just being honest.

624
00:44:24,413 --> 00:44:26,748
I don't think you need to be that honest.

625
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:29,585
Hey, TARS, what's your honesty parameter?

626

793
00:58:06,234 --> 00:58:07,527
It's a sphere.

794
00:58:07,694 --> 00:58:11,656
Of course it is. What, you--?
You thought it would just be a hole?

795
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:15,952
No, it's just that all the illustrations
I've ever seen, they...

796
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:19,580
ROMILLY: In the illustrations,
they're trying to show you how it works.

797

-Mm-hm.

799
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:31,968
So a Wormhole bends space like this,
so you can take a shortcut through...

Okay, so...

three-dimensional space into two dimensions...

into two dimensions, a circle.

What's a circle in three dimensions?

805
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:49,027
- A sphere.
-Exactly.

806

Instead of taking the Endurance into orbit
around Miller's planet...

877
01:04:35,498 --> 01:04:38,376
...which would conserve fuel,
but we would lose a lot of time...

878

...what if we take a wider orbit around
Gargantua, parallel with Miller's planet...

...outside of this time shift, to here?
