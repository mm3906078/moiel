00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,807
Look, Coop, you have
to be realistic.

155
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,768
You're ruling my son
out for college now?

156
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,814
- The kid's 15.
- Tom's score simply isn't high enough.

157
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,984
What's your waistline?
About what, 32?

158
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:56,071
- About a 33 inseam?
- I'm not sure I see what you're getting at.

159
00:10:56,239 --> 00:11:00,659
It takes two numbers to measure your ass
but only one to measure my son's future?

160
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,413
Come on. You're
a well-educated man, Coop.

161
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,540
- And a trained pilot.
- And an engineer.

162
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:11,795
Okay, well, right now
we don't need more engineers.

163
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:16,592
We didn't run out of television screens
and planes. We ran out of food.

164
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,346
The world needs farmers.
Good farmers, like you.

165
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,890
- And Tom.
- Uneducated farmers.

166
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,728
We're a caretaker generation, Coop.
And things are getting better.

167
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,023
- Maybe your grandkids will get to be engin...
- Are we done here, sir?

168
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,400
No.

169
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,403
Miss Hanley's here
to talk about Murph.

170
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,281
<font color="#804040">HANLEY</font>: Murph is a great
kid. She's really bright.

171
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,700
But she's been having a little trouble
lately.

172
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,245
She brought this in to show the students.
The section on the lunar landings.

173
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,915
Yeah, it's one of my old
textbooks.

174
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,376
She always loved the pictures.

175
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,254
It's an old federal textbook. We've replaced
them with the corrected versions.

176
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,464
Corrected?

177
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:59,760
Explaining how the Apollo missions were
faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

178
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,435
You don't believe
we went to the moon?

179
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,563
It was a brilliant
piece of propaganda.

180
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,566
The Soviets bankrupted
themselves pouring resources...

181
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,985
into rockets and other
useless machines.

182
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,237
"Useless machines."

183
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:22,491
If we don't want a repeat of the excess
and wastefulness of the 20th century, then...

184
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,453
we need to teach our kids about this
planet, not tales of leaving it.

185
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:31,291
One of those useless machines
they used to make was called an MRI.

186
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:35,003
If we had any of those left, the doctors
would've been able to find...

187
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,924
the cyst in my wife's brain
before she died instead of afterwards.

188
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,177
Then she'd have been the one listening
to this instead of me...

189
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,431
which would have been a good
thing, because she was always...

190
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,516
the calmer one.

191
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,269
I'm sorry about your wife,
Mr. Cooper.

192
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:55,190
But Murph got into a fistfight with several
of her classmates over this...

193
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,025
Apollo nonsense.

194
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,653
So we thought it best to bring
you in and see what ideas...

195
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,489
you might have for dealing with her
behavior on the home front.

196
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,743
Yeah, you know what? Um,
there's a game tomorrow night.

197
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,037
She's going through a bit
of a baseball phase.

198
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:13,417
Her favorite team is playing.
There's gonna be candy and soda and...

199
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,338
I think I'll take her to that.

rebuilt went haywire.

with the compass.

Yeah.

- I know what Morse code is, Murph.

I just don't think
your bookshelf's trying to talk to you.

221
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,888
Had to reset every compass clock
and GPS to offset for the anomaly.

- Which is?
- I don't know.

gadget or idea. Like
every day was Christmas.

But six billion people...

just try to imagine that.

at our place in the stars.

You had the coordinates for this facility

I knew a Dr. Brand once.
He was a professor.

It's kind of hard to explain.

356
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:18,219
We learned these coordinates
from an anomaly.

357
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,305
What sort of anomaly?

358
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,766
I hesitate to term it supernatural,
but it definitely wasn't scientific.

359
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:27,854
You're going to have to be
specific, Mr. Cooper. Right now.

360
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:29,272
It was gravity.

361
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:37,155
Um, what sort of gravitational
anomaly? Where was this?

362

Now, I'm real happy that you're

Earth's atmosphere is 80
percent nitrogen.

394

We don't even breathe nitrogen.

395
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:28,391
Blight does. And as it thrives,
our air gets less and less oxygen.

396

The last people to starve
will be the first to suffocate.

- Oh, that sounds cheerful.
- Lazarus came back from the dead.

410

Sure, but he had to die
in the first place.

There's not a planet in our solar
system that could sustain life...

- You're the best pilot we ever had.
- I barely left the stratosphere.

419
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,427
This team never
left the simulator.

420
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:50,556
We need a pilot, and this is the mission
that you were trained for.

421
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,225
Without even knowing it?

422
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:57,522
An hour ago, you didn't even know
I was alive. You were going anyway.

423
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,398
We had no choice.

424
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,317
But something sent you here.

425
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:04,362
- They chose you.
- Who's "they"?

426

How long would I be gone?

427
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,750
Hard to know. Years?

428
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,086
I've got kids, professor.

429
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,630
Get out there and save them.

430
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,385
Who's "they"?

431
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:31,347
We started detecting gravitational
anomalies almost 50 years ago.

432
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:35,309
Mostly small distortions to our instruments
in the upper atmosphere.

433
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,604
In fact, I believe you
encountered one yourself.

434
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:41,274
Yeah, over the Straights.

435
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:45,319
My crash. Something
tripped my fly-by-wire.

436
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:46,696
Exactly.

437
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:52,451
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this:

438
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,620
Out near Saturn...

439
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,872
a disturbance of space-time.

440
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:02,128
- Is that a wormhole?
- It appeared 48 years ago.

441
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,505
And it leads where?

442
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,674
Another galaxy.

443
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,678
A wormhole's not a naturally
occurring phenomenon.

444
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,263
Someone placed it there.

445
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,557
- "They"?
- Mm.

446
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:19,145
And whoever they are, they appear
to be looking out for us.

447
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,189
That wormhole lets us
travel to other stars.

448
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,275
It came along right
as we needed it.

449
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,361
They've put potentially habitable
worlds right within our reach.

450
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,447
Twelve, in fact,
from our initial probes.

451
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,991
- You sent probes into that?
- Mm-hm.

452
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,161

Ten years ago.

455
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,209
twelve Ranger
launches carrying...

456
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,087
the bravest humans
ever to live...

457
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,882
led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

458
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,385
Each person's landing pod had
enough life support for two years.

459
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,512
But they could use hibernation
to stretch that...

460
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,891
making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

461
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:00,895
Their mission was to assess their world,
and if it showed potential...

462
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:05,650
then they could send out a signal, bed
down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.

463
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,860
And what if the world
didn't show promise?

464
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,904
Hence the bravery.

465
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,240
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12.

466
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,533
No.

467
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,204
Data transmission back
through the wormhole is rudimentary.

468
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:23,417
Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us
some clue as to which worlds have potential.

469
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,378
And one system shows promise.

470
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,255
One. That's a bit
of a long shot, isn't it?

471
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:31,926
One system
with three potential worlds?

472
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,928
No long shot.

473
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,223
Okay.

474
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,267
So if we find a home...

475
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:46,399
- then what?
- That's the long shot.

476
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,944
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

477
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,406
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

478
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:08,045
<font color="#804040">COOPER</font>: This entire
facility's a centrifuge.

479
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,881
Some kind of vehicle.
A space station?

480
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,967
<font color="#804040">BRAND</font>: Both. Plan A.

481
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:15,219
How do you get it
off the ground?

482
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:19,056
The first gravitational
anomalies changed everything.

483
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:23,728
Suddenly we knew that harnessing
gravity was real.

484
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:28,733
So I started working on a theory
and we started building this station.

485
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,193
But you haven't solved it yet.

486
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,821
That's why there's Plan B.

487
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:39,034
The problem is gravity. How to get a viable
amount of human life off the planet.

488
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,494
This is one way.

489
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,330
<font color="#804040">Plan B</font>: A population bomb.

490
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:48,419
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs weighing
in at just under 900 kilos.

491
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,629
How would you raise them?

492
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,257
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

493
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:57,303
After that, with surrogacy,
the growth becomes exponential.

494
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:01,307
Within 30 years, we could
have a colony of hundreds.

495
00:35:01,475 --> 00:35:04,852
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

496
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,021
This takes care of that.

497
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,648
But what about the people
here? You just...

498
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,358
give up on them?

499
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,235
My kids?

500
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:17,114
That's why Plan A
is a lot more fun.

501
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,244
- How far have you got?
- Almost there.

502
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,830
You're asking me
to hang everything...

503
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,208
on an almost.

504
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:30,044
I'm asking you to trust me.

505
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:32,963
<font color="#808080">(SIGHS)</font>

506
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,799
Find us a new home.

507
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,551
And by the time you return...

508
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,805
I will have solved
the problem of gravity.

509
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,349
I give you my word.

510
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,488
<font color="#804040">MURPH</font>: Go away!

511
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,208
Murph.

512
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,586
<font color="#804040">MURPH</font>: Go! If you're
leaving, just go.

513
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:18,217
<font color="#804040">DONALD</font>: This world was never
enough for you, was it, Coop?

514
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:22,805
What, because heading out there
is what I feel like I was born to do?

515
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,599
And it excites me? Heh.

516
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,769
No, that does not make it wrong.

517
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,062
It might.

518
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,566
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

519
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,652
The why of the thing,
that's the foundation.

520
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,904
And the foundation's solid.

521
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:47,079
We farmers, we sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say:

522
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,622
"Next year."

523
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,960
Well, next year ain't gonna
save us, nor the one after that.

524
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:57,923
This world's a treasure, Donald,
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.

525
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,432
Mankind was born on Earth, it
was never meant to die here.

526
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,771
Tom will be all right, but you got
to make things right with Murph.

527
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:13,981
I will.

528
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:18,110
Without making promises you
don't know you can keep.

529
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,748
You have to talk to me, Murph.

530
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,377
I need to fix this before I go.

531
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,422
<font color="#804040">MURPH</font>: Then I'll keep it
broken so you have to stay.

532
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:45,012
After you kids came along, your mom said
something to me I never quite understood.

533
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,014
She said, "Now..."

534
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:53,395
"we're just here to be
memories for our kids."

535
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,028
And I think that now
I understand what she meant.

536
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:08,535
Once you're a parent, you're
the ghost of your children's future.

537
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:12,331
You said ghosts didn't exist.

538
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,297
That's right, Murph.

539
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,843
Murph, look at me.

540
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,391
I can't be your ghost right now.

541
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,186
I need to exist.

542
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,731
They chose me.

543
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:42,403
Murph, they chose me. You saw.
You're the one who led me to them.

544
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,533
That's exactly why you can't go.

545
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,705
I figured out the message.

546
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:56,333
- One word. Know what it is?
- Murph.

547
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,835
"Stay."

548
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:01,088
- It says, "Stay," Dad.
- Murph.

549
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,507
You don't believe me.

550
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,468
Look at the books! Look
at this. It says, "Stay."

551
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,596
Why...? You're not
listening! It says, "Stay!"

552
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,765
No, I'm coming back.

553
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,267
When?

554
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,741
One for you, one for me.

555
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,286
When I'm up there
in hypersleep, or...

556
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,164
traveling near the speed
of light, or...

557
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,292
near a black hole...

558
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:43,297
time's gonna change for me.
It's gonna run more slowly.

559
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,675
When we get back...

560
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,219
we're gonna compare.

561
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,014
- <font color="#804040">MURPH</font>: Time will run differently for us?
- Yeah.

562
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:57,770
By the time I get back, we might
even be the same age, you and me.

563
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,481
"What?" Imagine that!

564
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,195
Aw, Murph...

565
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,989
You have no idea when
you're coming back.

566
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:12,284
No idea at all!

567
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,539
Murph, don't... Don't
make me leave like this.

568
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,208
Come on, Murph!

569
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,044
Don't make me leave
like this, Murph!

570
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,677
Hey...

571
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:32,554
I love you.

572
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,848
Forever. You hear me?

573
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:38,519
I love you forever,
and I'm coming back.

574
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,651
I'm coming back.

575
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,046
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

576
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,257
Just fine.

577
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,848
I love you, Tom.

578
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,517
- Travel safe, huh?
- Yeah.

579
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,936
You look after our place
for me, all right?

580
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:22,729
- All right?
- Uh-huh.

581
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:30,612
- Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?
- You mean your truck?

582
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,740
I'll make sure
they bring it back.

583
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,661
Look after my kids, Donald!

584
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:53,760

All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.

Prepare for stage

Stage one.

There is Mach 1.

599
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:49,316
Everybody good? Plenty
of slaves for my robot colony?

600
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:54,488
They gave him a humor setting so
he'd fit in better with his unit.

601
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,490
He thinks it relaxes us.

602

That'd probably help.

606

You can use it to find your way back

We're going to be spending
a lot of time together.

622
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,407
- We should learn to talk.
- And when not to.

623
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,244
Just being honest.

624
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,747
I don't think you need
to be that honest.

625
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,583
Hey, TARS, what's your honesty
parameter?

626
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:32,377
- <font color="#804040">TARS</font>: Ninety percent.
- Ninety percent?

627
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:35,589
Absolute honesty isn't always
the most diplomatic, nor the...

628
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:38,342
safest form of communication
with emotional beings.

629
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,968
Okay.

630
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:43,055
Ninety percent it is, Dr. Brand.

631
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:49,978
We are coming up on the Endurance.
Twelve minutes out.

Okay. Taking control.

Nice and easy, Doyle.
Nice and easy.

636
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,003

Never mind.

644
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,038
Cooper, you should have control.

645
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,873

All right, we're all set.

All right, let's do it.

653
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,357
Heh.

Mm. Yeah, I just need a minute.

661
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,640
OK, I think we have some Dramamine
in the hab pod, I'm just gonna get that

662
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,600
or maybe in the cryo-beds.
I'll just be a sec.

- Hey, Brand?
- Yeah?

664

666
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,705
- Give my regards to Dr. Mann.
- I will, Dad.

667
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,790
It looks good
for your trajectory.

668
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,294
We've calculated
two years to Saturn.

669
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:26,546
That's a lot of Dramamine.

670
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:29,716
Look after my family,
will you, please, sir?

671

We'll be waiting for you

A little older, a little wiser,

So alone.

00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,415
We have each other.
Dr. Mann had it worse.

No, I mean them.

686
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:46,251
Hm?

No, it's not like looking
for a new condo.

689
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,845
The human race is going to be...

690
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:58,388
adrift...

691
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:02,058
desperate for a rock it can cling
to while it catches its breath.

692
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:04,477
We need to find that rock.

693
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:07,522
And our three prospects
are at the edge of what...

694
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,566
might sustain human life.

695
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,527
Laura Miller's planet is first.

696
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:14,821
- Laura started our biology program.
- <font color="#804040">COOPER</font>: Mm-hm.

697
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:22,996

- Tell me about Edmunds.

698
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:26,583
Oh, uh, Wolf's a particle
physicist.

699
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:31,212
None of them had families, huh?

700
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:35,133
No. No attachments.
My father insisted.

701
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:38,845
They all knew the odds against ever
seeing another human being again.

702
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,973
I'm hoping we can surprise
at least three of them.

703
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,057
- How about Mann?
- Dr. Mann?

704
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,143
He's remarkable.
He's the best of us.

705
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:49,689
He inspired 11 people to follow him
on the loneliest journey in human history.

706
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,441
Scientists, explorers.

707
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:55,695
That's what I love. You know,
out there we face great odds.

708
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:57,614
Death, but...

709
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,700
not evil.

710
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:02,744
You don't think
nature can be evil?

711
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,789
No. Formidable.
Frightening. But...

712
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:08,583
- no, not evil.
- Hm.

713
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:13,046
Is a lion evil because it
rips a gazelle to shreds?

714
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,548
Just what we take with us, then.

715
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,133
Yeah.

716
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,636
This crew represents
the best of humanity.

717
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:20,970
Even me, huh?

718
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,139
You know what? We
agreed, 90 percent.

719
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:24,390
There you go.

720
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:27,185
- Don't stay up.
- I'll be there in a minute.

721
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:31,397
Just remember, Coop, you
are literally wasting your breath.

722
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:41,241
Hey, TARS? Let's go
over that trajectory one more time.

723
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,243
<font color="#804040">TARS</font>: Eight months to Mars.

Fourteen months to Saturn.

725
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:48,164
Nothing's changed on that.

726
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:50,416
Just let me ask you something.

727
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:56,130
- Dr. Brand and Edmunds...
- Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.

728
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,593
Dr. Brand and Edmunds.
They close?

729
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:02,178
I wouldn't know.

730
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:05,348
Is that 90 percent "wouldn't know"
or 10 percent "wouldn't know"?

731
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:08,643
- I also have a discretion setting, Cooper.
- Aah.

732
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:12,272
But not a poker face, Slick.

733
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:25,869
Hey, guys.

734
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:29,372
Uh, Dad's about to go
down for the long nap.

735
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:32,333
So I wanted to give
you an update.

736
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:33,626
Uh...

737
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:37,881
The Earth looks amazing
from here. Um...

738
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:41,259
You can't see
any of the dust. Heh.

739
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:45,555
Um, I really hope you
guys are doing great.

740
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:50,143
I know you'll get this message.
Professor Brand's assured me he'll get it to you.

741
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:52,729
Know that I love you.

742
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,482
- Is it him?
- <font color="#804040">DONALD</font>: I don't think so, Murph.

743
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,033
You must be Donald.

744
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,411
Hello, Murph.

745
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:11,164
Why are you in my dad's truck?

746
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,958
He wanted me to bring
it for your brother.

747
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,878
He sent you a message.

748
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,966
She's pretty upset
with him for leaving.

749
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:26,220
If you record any messages, I can
get them to transmit it to Cooper.

750
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:29,974
Murph is a bright spark.

751
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,519
Maybe I should fan the flame.

752
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,272
She's already making
fools of her teachers.

753
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,275
So maybe she should come
and make a fool out of you.

754
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:43,196
- So where are they?
- Heading for Mars.

755
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:47,909
The next time you hear from Cooper,
they'll be coming up on Saturn.

756
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,586
<font color="#804040">TOM ON RECORDING</font>: As
far as school goes...

757
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:32,912
the administration wants me to repeat
Plant Pathology. Which sucks.

758
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:36,624
But they said I could start

Of course it is. What, you...? You
thought it would just be a hole?

No, it's just that all the illustrations

797
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,579
<font color="#804040">ROMILLY</font>: In the illustrations, they're

from here to there.

- But it's too far, right?
- Mm-hm.

800
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:31,966
So a wormhole bends space like this,
so you can take a shortcut through...

a higher dimension.

802

Okay, so...

803
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:39,765
to show that, they've turned three-dimensional
space into two dimensions...

804
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:43,895
which turns a wormhole
into two dimensions, a circle.

805
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:46,314
What's a circle
in three dimensions?

806
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,025
- A sphere.
- Exactly.

01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:39,523
Plan A does not work if the people on Earth

Okay. Cooper's right.

All right, look.

Dr. Mann's data is promising, but it
will take months to get there.

866
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:02,588
And Edmunds', it's even further.

867
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:06,926
Miller hasn't sent much, but what she has
is very promising. It's water, it's organics...

868
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,261
- You don't find that every day.
- No, you don't.

869
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:11,764
And just think about the resources,
including time...

870
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:14,433
that would be spent
trying to get back here.

- Romilly...
- Yeah?

How far off from Miller's planet do we have
to be to stay out of the time shift?

873
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:23,192
Just back from the cusp.

874
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,320
All right, which is here, just
outside of Miller's planet.

875
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:28,280
- <font color="#804040">ROMILLY</font>: Right.
- Okay.

876
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,992
Here's Gargantua.
Here's Miller's planet.

877
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,329
Instead of taking the Endurance
into orbit around Miller's planet...

878
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:38,374
which would conserve fuel,
but we would lose a lot of time...

879
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:42,628
what if we take a wider orbit around Gargantua,
parallel with Miller's planet...

880
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:45,297
outside of this time
shift, to here?

881
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:48,259
Then we take the Ranger down,
we get Miller, we get her samples.

882
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:51,136
We come back, we analyze,
we debrief. We're in, we're out.

883
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:53,639
We lose a little fuel,
but we save a whole lot of time.

884
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:55,641
- That'll work.
- That's good.

885
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:58,269
There's no time for monkey
business or chit-chat down there.

886
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:01,230
So, TARS, you should
definitely stay here.

887
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:03,649
CASE, you're with me.
Anyone else can stay.

888
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:07,403
If we're talking about a couple years,
I could use the time to research gravity.

889
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:10,531

sure we stay in range of Miller's planet.

898
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:49,820
A literal heart of darkness.

899
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:56,702
If we could just see
the collapsed star inside...

900
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:59,622
the singularity, yeah,
we'd solve gravity.

901
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:03,334
- And we can't get anything from it?
- Nothing escapes that horizon.

902
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:04,835
Not even light.

903
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:08,505
- The answer's there, just no way to see it.
- There's Miller's planet.

- No.

I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics

The only time I went down was when
a machine was easing at the wrong time.

- A little caution...
- Can get you killed, like reckless driving.

she was...

broken up by a wave
soon after impact.

How's the wreckage stayed together
after all these years, huh?

995
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,408
Because of the time slippage.

On this planet's time,
she just landed hours ago.

I'm counting every minute,
same as you, Cooper.

Time is relative, okay?

1010
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:11,464
It can stretch and it
can squeeze, but...

1011
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:14,176
it can't run backwards.
It just can't.

1012
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:18,763
The only thing that can move
across dimensions, like time, is gravity.

Okay.

- Yes.

1016
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:32,819
Could they be talking
to us from the future?

1017
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:35,989
- Maybe.
- Okay. If they can...

1018
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:40,452
"They" are beings
of five dimensions.

1019
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:44,206
To them, time might be
another physical dimension.

1020
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,874
To them...

1021
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:50,462
the past might be a canyon that they can
climb into and the future...

1022
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:53,632
a mountain they can climb up.
But to us, it's not, okay?

Look, Cooper, I screwed
up. I'm sorry.

01:18:15,483 --> 01:18:16,983
Why didn't you sleep?

1055
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:22,030
Oh, I had a couple of stretches. But
I stopped believing you were coming back.

1056
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:25,533
And something seemed wrong
about dreaming my life away.

1057
01:18:26,369 --> 01:18:29,204
I learned what I could
from the black hole...

1058
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:32,040
but I couldn't send
anything to your father.

1059
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,459
We've been receiving,
but nothing gets out.

1067
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:01,277
Checking in. Saying hi.

Finished second in school.

Miss Kurling's still
giving me C's though.

1071
01:19:10,121 --> 01:19:12,956
Pulled me down,
but second's not bad.

1072
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:16,292
Grandpa attended the ceremony.

Um... Oh.

1074
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:22,841
I met another girl, Dad.

1075
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:24,592
I, uh...

1076
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:27,345
I really think this is the one.

1077
01:19:28,639 --> 01:19:31,224
Name's Lois. That's her
right there.

Murphy stole Grandpa's car.

1079
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:39,607
She crashed it.
She's okay, though.

1080
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:41,359
Hey, Dad.

1081
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:43,611
Look at this!

1082
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:45,947
You're a grandpa.

1083
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:49,033
His name's Jesse.

1084
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:54,289
I kind of wanted to call him Coop,
but Lois says, uh, maybe next time.

1085
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:59,377
Donald says he's already earned the "great"
part, so we just leave it at that.

We buried him out in the back
forty next to Mom and...

1096
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,827
Jesse.

1097
01:20:33,704 --> 01:20:36,789
Which is where we would have
buried you if you'd ever...

come back.

We don't see her that much,
but she came for that.

01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:51,804
You aren't listening
to this, I know that.

1102

All these messages
are just, like...

drifting out there
in the darkness.

1104

Lois says that, uh...

1105
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:09,489
I have to let you go.

And, uh...

1107
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:13,284
so...

1108
01:21:16,539 --> 01:21:19,624
I guess I'm letting you go.

1109
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:23,253
I don't know where
you are, Dad...

You son of a bitch.

1115
01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:56,536
I never made one of these when
you were still responding...

1116
01:21:56,704 --> 01:21:59,038
because I was so mad
at you for leaving.

1117
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:04,168
And then when you
went quiet, it...

1118
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:09,632
seemed like I should live
with that decision. And I have.

1119
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:16,556
But today's my birthday.

1120
01:22:20,227 --> 01:22:23,396
And it's a special one,
because you told me...

1121
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:31,863
You once told me that when you came
back, we might be the same age.

1122
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:36,659
And today I'm the age
you were when you left.

1123
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:41,748
So it would be a real good
time for you to come back.

I've never been in here before.

- <font color="#804040">MURPH</font>: I haven't. I...

1131
01:23:13,614 --> 01:23:16,115
I just had something
I needed to get out.

1132
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:18,868
- I know they're still out there.
- I know.

1133
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:23,247
There are so many reasons their communications
might not be getting through.

1134
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:24,832
I know, professor.

1135
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:28,378
I'm not sure what I'm
more afraid of.

1136
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:31,881
Them never coming back or...

1137
01:23:33,092 --> 01:23:36,302
coming back to find
we've failed.

1138
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:37,887
Then let's succeed.

So...

1140
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:44,686
back to the fourth iteration.
Let's run it through some new fields.

1141

With respect, professor, we've tried
that hundreds of times.

whether or not we crack the equation
before I kick the bucket.

- I'm not afraid of death.

You're afraid of time.

1151
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:31,649
We've been trying
to solve the equation...

1152
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:34,318
without changing the underlying
assumption about time.

1153
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:36,195
- And?
- And that means...

1154
01:24:36,363 --> 01:24:40,825
each iteration is an attempt
to prove its own proof.

1155
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:43,119
It's recursive.
It's nonsensical.

1156

Are you calling
my life's work...

1157
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:47,206
nonsense, Murph?

1158
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:49,417
No, I'm saying
that you've been trying to...

01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:53,379
finish it with one arm... No,
with both arms... tied behind your back.

up at another time?

We no longer have the fuel

1172

They're both promising.

1175
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:55,399
Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann
is the one still transmitting, so...

1176
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:58,486
We've no reason to suspect
Edmunds' data would have soured.

His world has key elements
to sustain human life.

1178
01:26:02,074 --> 01:26:05,243
- As does Dr. Mann's.
- Cooper, this is my field.

1179
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:07,453
And...

1180
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:10,414
I really believe Edmunds'
is the better prospect.

1181

- Gargantua, that's why.

Look at Miller's planet.
Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...

1183
01:26:19,258 --> 01:26:23,678
but no life. Sterile. We'll find
the same thing on Mann's.

1184
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:25,763
Because of the black hole?

1185
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:29,100
Murphy's Law. Whatever
can happen will happen.

1186
01:26:29,268 --> 01:26:31,602
Accident is the first
building block of evolution.

1187
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:34,605
But when you're orbiting a black
hole not enough can happen.

1188
01:26:34,773 --> 01:26:39,068
It sucks in asteroids and comets, other
events which would otherwise reach you.

1189
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:41,279
We need to go further afield.

1190
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:44,240
You once said that Dr. Mann...

1191
01:26:45,492 --> 01:26:46,993
was the best of us.

1192
01:26:47,286 --> 01:26:50,454
He's remarkable. We're
only here because of him.

1193
01:26:50,998 --> 01:26:52,832
And yet... Yet here he is.

1194
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,962
He's on the ground, and he's sending
a very unambiguous message, telling us...

1195
01:26:58,130 --> 01:26:59,839
to come to his planet.

1196
01:27:00,007 --> 01:27:04,635
Granted, but Edmunds'
data is more promising.

1197
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:06,137
We should vote.

1198
01:27:06,305 --> 01:27:08,472
Well, if we vote, there's something
you should know.

1199
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:10,641
Brand?

1200
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:12,476
He has a right to know.

1201
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:14,729
That has nothing to do with it.

1204
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:26,532
And that makes me want

1205
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:33,664
But maybe we've spent too long trying
to figure all this out with theory.

1206
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:35,249
You're a scientist, Brand.

1207
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:36,959
So listen to me...

1208
01:27:37,794 --> 01:27:42,506
when I say that love isn't
something we invented. It's...

1209
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:45,843
observable, powerful.

1210
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:49,639
It has to mean something.

1211
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:54,185
Love has meaning, yes. Social utility,
social bonding, child rearing...

1212
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:57,855
We love people who have died.
Where's the social utility in that?

1213
01:27:58,398 --> 01:27:59,440
None.

1214
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:03,486
Maybe it means something
more, something we can't...

1215
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:05,696
yet understand.

1216
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:09,325
Maybe it's some evidence,
some...

1217
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:14,747
artifact of a higher dimension
that we can't consciously perceive.

1218
01:28:14,915 --> 01:28:19,710
I'm drawn across the universe to someone
I haven't seen in a decade...

1219
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:22,713
who I know is probably dead.

1220
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:26,384
Love is the one thing we're
capable of perceiving...

1221
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:29,387
that transcends dimensions
of time and space.

1222
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:35,559
Maybe we should trust that,
even if we can't understand it yet.

1223
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:42,233
All right, Cooper...

1224
01:28:44,111 --> 01:28:45,403
yes...

1225
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:49,907
the tiniest possibility of seeing
Wolf again excites me.

1226
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:52,410
That doesn't mean I'm wrong.

1228
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:58,249
it might.

He had no pain.

1359
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,460
He was at peace.

1360
01:40:52,547 --> 01:40:54,381
I'm sorry for your loss.

1361

1363
01:41:01,139 --> 01:41:02,723

1364
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:05,559
He told you, right?

1365
01:41:08,604 --> 01:41:09,896
You knew.

1366
01:41:11,649 --> 01:41:13,150
This was all a sham.

1367
01:41:14,193 --> 01:41:15,861
You left us here.

1368
01:41:17,989 --> 01:41:19,489
To suffocate.

1369
01:41:21,576 --> 01:41:22,951

1370
01:41:26,289 --> 01:41:27,873

1373
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:35,589
I just want to know...

1374
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:38,925
if you left me here to die.

1375
01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:43,513
I just have to know.

01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:50,437
Cooper, my...

1377
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:53,857
My father dedicated...

1378
01:41:54,233 --> 01:41:59,237
his whole life to Plan A. I have
no idea what she's talking about.

1379
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:02,115
<font color="#804040">MANN</font>: I do.

1380
01:42:07,246 --> 01:42:09,915
He never even hoped to get
the people off the Earth?

1381
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:12,334
No.

1382
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:20,217
But he's been trying to solve
the gravity equation for 40 years.

1383
01:42:20,718 --> 01:42:24,137
Amelia, your father solved
his equation before I even left.

1384
01:42:24,722 --> 01:42:26,598
Then why wouldn't he use it?

1385
01:42:26,766 --> 01:42:30,727
The equation couldn't reconcile relativity
with quantum mechanics. You need more.

1386
01:42:30,895 --> 01:42:32,813
More? More what?

1387
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:35,982
<font color="#804040">MANN</font>: More data. You need
to see into a black hole.

1388
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:38,235

a naked singularity.

1389
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:39,903
Romilly, is that true?

1390
01:42:41,197 --> 01:42:44,908
If a black hole is an oyster, then
the singularity's the pearl inside.

1391
01:42:45,076 --> 01:42:47,828
The gravity's so strong,
it's always hidden in darkness...

1392
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:49,412
behind the horizon.

1393
01:42:50,832 --> 01:42:52,916
That's why we call
it a black hole.

1394
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:56,503
Okay, but if we see
beyond the horizon...

1395
01:42:57,088 --> 01:42:58,588
We can't, Coop.

Your father had to find another way
to save the human race from extinction.

1398
01:43:05,805 --> 01:43:07,305
Plan B. A colony.

1399
01:43:07,473 --> 01:43:09,140
Why not tell people?

1400
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:13,812
- Why keep building those stations?
- He knew how hard it would be...

1401
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:18,108
to get people to work together
to save the species instead of themselves.

1402
01:43:18,276 --> 01:43:19,442
Or their children.

1403
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:20,652
Bullshit.

01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:23,613
<font color="#804040">MANN</font>: You never would've come unless you

Evolution has yet to transcend
that simple barrier.

1406
01:43:27,159 --> 01:43:29,619
We can care deeply,
selflessly about...

1407
01:43:29,787 --> 01:43:33,290
those we know, but that empathy rarely
extends beyond our line of sight.

1408
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:35,166
But the lie.

1409
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:40,881
That monstrous lie?

1410
01:43:42,133 --> 01:43:43,425
Unforgivable.

1411
01:43:43,593 --> 01:43:45,051
And he knew that.

1412
01:43:45,803 --> 01:43:50,140
He was prepared to destroy his own humanity
in order to save the species.

1413
01:43:50,308 --> 01:43:52,726
- He made an incredible sacrifice.
- No.

1414
01:43:54,145 --> 01:43:59,024
An incredible sacrifice is being made
by the people on Earth who are gonna die!

1415
01:43:59,483 --> 01:44:01,651
Because in his fucking
arrogance...

1416
01:44:02,069 --> 01:44:04,154
he declared their case hopeless.

1417
01:44:04,822 --> 01:44:06,323
I'm sorry, Cooper...

1418
01:44:06,866 --> 01:44:08,325
their case is hopeless.

1419
01:44:08,492 --> 01:44:10,619
No. No.

1420
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:12,746
We are the future.

1421
01:44:16,417 --> 01:44:18,335
Cooper, what can I do?

1422
01:44:21,547 --> 01:44:23,381
Let me go home.

1425
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:32,307
- It's worthless?
- It's half the answer.

1426
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:36,269
Okay, how do you
find the other half?

1427
01:44:36,854 --> 01:44:38,521
Out there? A black hole.

1428
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:41,524
- But stuck down here on Earth?
- Yeah?

1429
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:44,527
I'm not sure you can.

1432
01:44:53,204 --> 01:44:54,245
Survival.

1433
01:45:02,046 --> 01:45:03,129
Damn it.

1434
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:09,844
Murph, don't...? Don't
people have a right to know?

1435
01:45:10,471 --> 01:45:14,557
Panic won't help. We just have
to keep working, same as ever.

1436
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:18,061
But isn't that exactly what Professor Brand
was manipulating us to do?

1437
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:21,481
Brand gave up on us. I'm
still trying to solve this.

1438
01:45:22,108 --> 01:45:23,191
So...

1439
01:45:24,610 --> 01:45:26,277
do you have an idea?

1440
01:45:26,988 --> 01:45:28,321
A feeling.

1441
01:45:31,742 --> 01:45:33,743
I told you about my ghost.

1442
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:37,789
My dad thought
I called it a ghost...

1443
01:45:38,249 --> 01:45:39,916
because I was scared of it.

1444
01:45:43,379 --> 01:45:44,713
But I was never scared of it.

1445
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:49,592
I called it a ghost
because it felt...

1446
01:45:52,013 --> 01:45:53,680
It felt like a person.

1447
01:45:56,225 --> 01:45:57,892
It was trying to tell
me something.

1448
01:46:00,855 --> 01:46:03,857
If there's an answer here
on Earth, it's back there...

1449
01:46:04,316 --> 01:46:06,234
somehow, in that room.

1450
01:46:06,777 --> 01:46:08,528
So I have to find it.

1451
01:46:11,949 --> 01:46:13,700
We're running out of time.

1452

- Yeah?

1455
01:46:21,876 --> 01:46:23,877
I have a suggestion
for your return journey.

1456
01:46:24,045 --> 01:46:26,796
- Yeah, what's that?
- Have one last crack at the black hole.

1457
01:46:28,674 --> 01:46:30,258
I'm going home, Rom.

1458
01:46:30,426 --> 01:46:33,678
Yeah, I know. This isn't
going to cost you any time.

1459
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:36,264
There's a chance
for the people on Earth.

1460
01:46:37,016 --> 01:46:40,060
- Talk to me.
- Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.

1461
01:46:40,227 --> 01:46:44,105
- It's what we call a gentle singularity.
- Gentle?

1462
01:46:44,273 --> 01:46:47,734
They're hardly gentle. But the tidal
gravity is so quick that...

1463
01:46:47,902 --> 01:46:52,155
something crossing the horizon
fast might survive. A probe, say.

1464
01:46:52,323 --> 01:46:56,993
- What happens after it crosses?
- After the horizon is a complete mystery.

1465
01:46:57,161 --> 01:47:00,246
So, what's to say there isn't
some way that the probe...

1466
01:47:00,414 --> 01:47:03,333
can glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

1467
01:47:03,501 --> 01:47:06,753
If he's equipped to transmit
every form of energy that can pulse.

become a "he," professor?

1469

TARS is the obvious candidate.

1470
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:14,761
I've already told him
what to look for.

1471
01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:17,639
I'd need the old optical
transmitter off KIPP, Cooper.

1472
01:47:17,807 --> 01:47:19,140
You'd do this for us?

1473
01:47:19,308 --> 01:47:23,228
Before you get all teary, remember
that as a robot I have to do anything you say.

1474
01:47:24,146 --> 01:47:25,605
Your cue light's broken.

1475
01:47:25,773 --> 01:47:27,315
I'm not joking.

1476
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:33,196
I'll need TARS to remove and adapt
some components from KIPP.

1477
01:47:33,364 --> 01:47:35,698
I don't want to disturb
his archival functions.

1478
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:37,367
I'll supervise.

1479
01:47:37,701 --> 01:47:38,743
All right.

1480
01:47:38,911 --> 01:47:43,581
Dr. Mann, we need to find three secure
sites. One for Brand's lab, two for habitat.

1481
01:47:43,749 --> 01:47:46,209
Once those modules have landed,
you don't want to move them.

1482
01:47:46,377 --> 01:47:48,920
I can take you to the probe
sites, but I don't think...

1483
01:47:49,088 --> 01:47:51,798
these conditions will hold.
I think we should wait.

Well, these squalls

Okay, then.

1488

- You'll need a long-range transmitter.
- Got it.

01:48:06,897 --> 01:48:08,439

1492
01:48:13,195 --> 01:48:14,404
Roger that, Cooper.

01:48:20,703 --> 01:48:23,746
<font color="#804040">MANN</font>: Brand told me why you

at least mention...

but they're not bound by anything!

02:30:19,427 --> 02:30:24,098

in time. They can't communicate.

1949

That's why I'm here. I'm gonna
find a way to tell Murph...

1951
02:30:30,438 --> 02:30:32,773
- How, Cooper?
- Love, TARS, love.

1952
02:30:32,941 --> 02:30:37,361
It's just like Brand said. My connection
with Murph, it is quantifiable. It's the key!

of the second hand.

1959

into Morse and feed it to me.
