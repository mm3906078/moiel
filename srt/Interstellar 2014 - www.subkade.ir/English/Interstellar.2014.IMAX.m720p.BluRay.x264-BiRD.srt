1
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,016
<i>Well, my dad was a farmer.</i>

2
00:01:18,184 --> 00:01:20,644
Um, like everybody else back then.

3
00:01:22,772 --> 00:01:24,940
<i>Of course, he didn't start that way.</i>

4
00:01:31,238 --> 00:01:33,157
<i>Computer says you're too tight.</i>

5
00:01:33,324 --> 00:01:35,868
<i>- Nah, I got this.
- Crossing the Straights.</i>

6
00:01:38,287 --> 00:01:40,039
<i>- Shutting it down, Cooper.
- No!</i>

7
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,959
<i>- Shutting it all down.
- No, I need power up!</i>

8
00:01:48,297 --> 00:01:49,340
Dad?

9
00:01:55,888 --> 00:01:58,390
Sorry, Murph. Go back to bed.

10
00:01:58,724 --> 00:02:01,227
- I thought you were the ghost.
- No.

11
00:02:02,895 --> 00:02:04,897
There are no such things as ghosts, babe.

12
00:02:05,064 --> 00:02:07,233
Grandpa says you can get ghosts.

13
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:13,405
Maybe that's because Grandpa's close
to being one himself. Back to bed.

14
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,574
Were you dreaming about the crash?

15
00:02:16,992 --> 00:02:19,286
Get your butt back in bed, Murph. Heh.

16
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:47,815
<i>The wheat had died.</i>

17
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:50,985
<i>The blight came and we had to burn it.</i>

18
00:02:51,902 --> 00:02:54,613
<i>And we still had corn. We had acres of corn.</i>

19
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,032
But, uh, mostly we had dust.

20
00:02:59,451 --> 00:03:02,079
<i>I guess I can't describe it. It was just constant.</i>

21
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:04,707
Just that steady blow...

22
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:06,125
<i>...of dirt.</i>

23
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,297
<i>We wore, um, little strips of sheet...</i>

24
00:03:11,463 --> 00:03:14,174
...sometimes over our nose and mouth...

25
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:16,844
<i>...so that we wouldn't breathe so much of it.</i>

26
00:03:18,554 --> 00:03:21,056
<i>When we set the table,
we always set the plate...</i>

27
00:03:21,223 --> 00:03:24,143
...upside-down.
Glasses or cups, whatever it was...

28
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,477
<i>...upside-down.</i>

29
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,152
Shake a leg! Murph, get a move on!

30
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,780
Tom, 4:00 today, you and me in the barn,
Herbicide Resistance 101.

31
00:03:36,947 --> 00:03:38,449
- Check?
- Yes, sir.

32
00:03:39,992 --> 00:03:41,660
Not at the table, Murph.

33
00:03:42,411 --> 00:03:44,246
Dad, can you fix this?

34
00:03:45,831 --> 00:03:47,166
What the heck did you do...

35
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,500
- ...to my lander?
- Wasn't me.

36
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:50,544
Let me guess. It was your ghost?

37
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:53,047
It knocked it off.
It keeps knocking books off.

38
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:54,715
No such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass.

39
00:03:54,882 --> 00:03:57,009
- Hey.
- I looked it up. It's called a poltergeist.

40
00:03:57,176 --> 00:03:58,427
Dad, tell her.

41
00:03:58,594 --> 00:04:00,512
Well, it's not very scientific, Murph.

42
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:03,015
You said science was about admitting
what we don't know.

43
00:04:03,182 --> 00:04:05,351
- She's got you there.
- Hey.

44
00:04:05,517 --> 00:04:07,019
Start looking after our stuff.

45
00:04:08,646 --> 00:04:09,855
Coop.

46
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,818
All right, Murph, you want to talk science?

47
00:04:15,778 --> 00:04:19,031
Don't tell me you're afraid of some ghost.
No, you got to go further.

48
00:04:19,198 --> 00:04:22,368
You got to record the facts, analyze,
get to the how and the why...

49
00:04:22,534 --> 00:04:25,454
...then present your conclusions. Deal?

50
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:27,539
- Deal.
- All right.

51
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:32,544
- Have a good day at school.
- Hold up.

52
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:35,172
Parent-teacher conferences. Parent.

53
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:37,299
Not grandparent.

54
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,387
Slow down, turbo!

55
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:45,849
- That's not a dust storm.
- Nelson's torching his whole crop.

56
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:47,393
Blight?

57
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:49,979
They're saying it's the last harvest for okra.

58
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:51,814
Ever.

59
00:04:53,732 --> 00:04:56,360
He should've planted corn like the rest of us.

60
00:04:56,527 --> 00:04:59,238
Now, be nice to that Miss Hanley. She's single.

61
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:00,906
What's that supposed to mean?

62
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:04,201
Repopulating the earth.
Start pulling your weight, young man.

63
00:05:04,368 --> 00:05:08,330
Why don't you start
minding your own business, old man?

64
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:17,297
All right, Murph, give me second.

65
00:05:18,924 --> 00:05:20,134
Uh-huh.

66
00:05:20,718 --> 00:05:22,094
Third.

67
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:25,305
- Find a gear, dumb-ass.
- Grind it!

68
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:26,515
Shut it, Tom!

69
00:05:27,891 --> 00:05:30,227
- What'd you do, Murph?
- Ah, she didn't do nothing.

70
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:32,896
- Blew a tire is all.
- Murphy's Law.

71
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:35,065
Shut up!

72
00:05:35,232 --> 00:05:36,984
- Grab the spare, Tom.
- That is the spare.

73
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:41,113
Get the patch kit!

74
00:05:42,406 --> 00:05:45,617
- How am I supposed to patch it out here?
- You got to figure it out.

75
00:05:45,784 --> 00:05:47,745
I'm not always gonna be here to help you.

76
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,921
What's going on, Murph?

77
00:05:58,088 --> 00:06:01,300
Why did you and Mom name me
after something that's bad?

78
00:06:01,467 --> 00:06:02,843
We didn't.

79
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:04,720
Murphy's Law?

80
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:09,767
Murphy's Law doesn't mean
that something bad will happen.

81
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:13,312
What it means is
whatever can happen will happen.

82
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:16,023
And that sounded just fine with us.

83
00:06:20,235 --> 00:06:21,779
Whoa!

84
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:23,655
Get in.

85
00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:26,450
Get in, let's go.

86
00:06:27,785 --> 00:06:29,912
What about the flat tire?

87
00:06:32,873 --> 00:06:34,208
Yeah.

88
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,184
It's an Indian Air Force drone.
Solar cells could power an entire farm.

89
00:06:52,351 --> 00:06:53,811
Take the wheel, Tom.

90
00:06:59,274 --> 00:07:00,609
Go, go, go!

91
00:07:02,194 --> 00:07:03,862
Keep that aimed right at it.

92
00:07:11,787 --> 00:07:14,206
Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.

93
00:07:14,873 --> 00:07:15,916
Right at it.

94
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:18,460
Stay on it.

95
00:07:20,045 --> 00:07:21,130
Here we go.

96
00:07:24,049 --> 00:07:25,259
Whoa.

97
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:31,974
Nice one, Tom.

98
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:39,815
Dad?

99
00:07:40,232 --> 00:07:42,985
I almost got it. Don't stop. Don't stop!

100
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:44,486
Dad!

101
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,029
Tom!

102
00:07:50,576 --> 00:07:52,911
You told me to keep driving.

103
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:58,208
Well, I guess that answers the old
"If I asked you to drive off a cliff" scenario.

104
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,256
- We lost it.
- No, we didn't.

105
00:08:16,935 --> 00:08:18,604
Want to give it a whirl?

106
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,986
This way.

107
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:32,451
Go.

108
00:08:33,452 --> 00:08:36,455
Let's lay her down right there
at the edge of the reservoir.

109
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:42,461
Nicely done.

110
00:08:45,464 --> 00:08:47,341
How long you think it's been up there?

111
00:08:47,507 --> 00:08:50,052
Delhi Mission Control went down,
same as ours...

112
00:08:50,219 --> 00:08:52,054
- ...ten years ago.
- Heh.

113
00:08:52,387 --> 00:08:54,306
So for ten years?

114
00:08:57,267 --> 00:08:59,895
- Why did it come down so low?
- I don't know.

115
00:09:00,062 --> 00:09:02,981
Maybe the sun cooked its brain
or it was looking for something.

116
00:09:03,148 --> 00:09:05,400
- What?
- Give me a large flatblade.

117
00:09:05,817 --> 00:09:08,487
Maybe some kind of signal? I don't know.

118
00:09:13,742 --> 00:09:15,244
What are you gonna do with it?

119
00:09:16,161 --> 00:09:19,331
I'm gonna give it something
socially responsible to do...

120
00:09:20,207 --> 00:09:21,541
...like drive a combine.

121
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,627
Can't we just let it go?

122
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:27,589
It wasn't hurting anybody.

123
00:09:29,258 --> 00:09:31,760
This thing needs to learn
how to adapt, Murph...

124
00:09:32,052 --> 00:09:33,553
...like the rest of us.

125
00:09:38,141 --> 00:09:39,851
How's this work?
You guys come with?

126
00:09:40,018 --> 00:09:41,061
I've got class.

127
00:09:41,478 --> 00:09:43,855
This one needs to wait.

128
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:48,193
- What did you do?
- They'll tell you about it in there.

129
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,529
- Am I gonna be mad?
- Not with me.

130
00:09:50,696 --> 00:09:53,865
- Just please try not to.
- Hey. Relax.

131
00:09:55,284 --> 00:09:56,618
I got this.

132
00:10:00,872 --> 00:10:02,165
Little late, Coop.

133
00:10:02,332 --> 00:10:03,875
Yeah, we had a flat.

134
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:07,587
And I guess you had to stop off
at the Asian fighter plane store.

135
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:11,466
No, actually, sir, that's a surveillance drone.

136
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:14,386
With outstanding solar cells. It's Indian.

137
00:10:14,803 --> 00:10:16,138
Take a seat.

138
00:10:17,264 --> 00:10:18,765
So, uh...

139
00:10:19,474 --> 00:10:22,060
...we got Tom's scores back.

140
00:10:22,602 --> 00:10:24,563
He's going to make an excellent farmer.

141
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,233
Yeah, he's got a knack for it.
What about college?

142
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,154
The university only takes a handful.
They don't have the resources to--

143
00:10:32,321 --> 00:10:34,614
I still pay my taxes.

144
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:36,783
Where's that money go?
There's no more armies.

145
00:10:37,284 --> 00:10:39,619
Well, it doesn't go to the university.

146
00:10:40,203 --> 00:10:41,830
Look, Coop, you have to be realistic.

147
00:10:41,997 --> 00:10:44,791
You're ruling my son out for college now?

148
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:48,837
- The kid's 15.
- Tom's score simply isn't high enough.

149
00:10:49,838 --> 00:10:52,007
What's your waistline? About what, 32?

150
00:10:52,424 --> 00:10:56,094
- About a 33 inseam?
- I'm not sure I see what you're getting at.

151
00:10:56,261 --> 00:11:00,682
It takes two numbers to measure your ass
but only one to measure my son's future?

152
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:04,436
Come on. You're a well-educated man, Coop.

153
00:11:04,603 --> 00:11:06,563
- And a trained pilot.
- And an engineer.

154
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:11,818
Okay, well, right now
we don't need more engineers.

155
00:11:12,277 --> 00:11:16,615
We didn't run out of television screens
and planes. We ran out of food.

156
00:11:16,948 --> 00:11:20,369
The world needs farmers.
Good farmers, like you.

157
00:11:20,535 --> 00:11:22,913
- And Tom.
- Uneducated farmers.

158
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:27,751
We're a caretaker generation, Coop.
And things are getting better.

159
00:11:27,918 --> 00:11:31,046
- Maybe your grandkids will get to be engin--
- Are we done here, sir?

160
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:33,423
No.

161
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:36,426
Miss Hanley's here to talk about Murph.

162
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,304
Murph is a great kid. She's really bright.

163
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:41,723
But she's been having a little trouble lately.

164
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,268
She brought this in to show the students.
The section on the lunar landings.

165
00:11:45,435 --> 00:11:47,938
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.

166
00:11:48,397 --> 00:11:50,399
She always loved the pictures.

167
00:11:50,565 --> 00:11:54,277
It's an old federal textbook. We've
replaced them with the corrected versions.

168
00:11:54,444 --> 00:11:55,487
Corrected?

169
00:11:55,654 --> 00:11:59,783
Explaining how the Apollo missions were faked
to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

170
00:12:06,498 --> 00:12:08,458
You don't believe we went to the moon?

171
00:12:09,584 --> 00:12:11,586
It was a brilliant piece of propaganda.

172
00:12:11,753 --> 00:12:14,589
The Soviets bankrupted themselves
pouring resources...

173
00:12:14,756 --> 00:12:17,008
...into rockets and other useless machines.

174
00:12:17,175 --> 00:12:18,260
"Useless machines."

175
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:22,514
If we don't want a repeat of the excess
and wastefulness of the 20th century, then...

176
00:12:22,681 --> 00:12:26,476
...we need to teach our kids about this planet,
not tales of leaving it.

177
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:31,314
One of those useless machines
they used to make was called an MRI.

178
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:35,026
If we had any of those left,
the doctors would've been able to find...

179
00:12:35,193 --> 00:12:38,947
...the cyst in my wife's brain
before she died instead of afterwards.

180
00:12:39,114 --> 00:12:42,200
Then she'd have been the one
listening to this instead of me...

181
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,454
...which would have been a good thing,
because she was always...

182
00:12:46,037 --> 00:12:47,539
...the calmer one.

183
00:12:48,206 --> 00:12:50,292
I'm sorry about your wife, Mr. Cooper.

184
00:12:51,543 --> 00:12:55,213
But Murph got into a fistfight
with several of her classmates over this...

185
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,048
...Apollo nonsense.

186
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,676
So we thought it best
to bring you in and see what ideas...

187
00:12:59,843 --> 00:13:02,512
...you might have for dealing
with her behavior on the home front.

188
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:06,766
Yeah, you know what?
Um, there's a game tomorrow night.

189
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:09,060
She's going through a bit of a baseball phase.

190
00:13:09,227 --> 00:13:13,440
Her favorite team is playing.
There's gonna be candy and soda and....

191
00:13:16,526 --> 00:13:18,361
I think I'll take her to that.

192
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,951
How'd it go?

193
00:13:25,869 --> 00:13:27,746
I got you suspended.

194
00:13:28,163 --> 00:13:29,498
<i>- What?
- Cooper.</i>

195
00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:32,417
This is Cooper. Go.

196
00:13:32,584 --> 00:13:35,420
<i>Coop, those combines you rebuilt
went haywire.</i>

197
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:37,756
Just reset the controllers.

198
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:40,717
<i>I did that. Now you should come take a look.</i>

199
00:14:00,445 --> 00:14:03,448
One by one they've been
peeling off the fields and heading over.

200
00:14:03,615 --> 00:14:05,450
Something's interfering with the compass.

201
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:09,329
Magnetism or some such.

202
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:53,915
Nothing special about which book.

203
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,835
I've been working on it, like you said.

204
00:14:57,586 --> 00:15:00,088
- I counted the spaces.
- Why?

205
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:04,217
In case the ghost is trying to communicate.

206
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,553
I'm trying Morse.

207
00:15:07,137 --> 00:15:08,388
Morse?

208
00:15:08,722 --> 00:15:09,806
Yeah.

209
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:12,851
- Dots and dashes, used--
- I know what Morse code is, Murph.

210
00:15:13,018 --> 00:15:15,937
I just don't think
your bookshelf's trying to talk to you.

211
00:15:27,532 --> 00:15:31,911
Had to reset every compass clock and GPS
to offset for the anomaly.

212
00:15:32,203 --> 00:15:34,748
- Which is?
- I don't know.

213
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,668
If the house was built on magnetic ore...

214
00:15:38,835 --> 00:15:41,921
...we'd have seen this the first time
we switched on the tractor.

215
00:15:44,591 --> 00:15:47,761
I hear your meeting at the school
didn't go so well.

216
00:15:48,386 --> 00:15:50,096
Heh. You heard?

217
00:15:51,056 --> 00:15:53,892
It's like we've forgotten who we are, Donald.

218
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,064
Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.

219
00:16:00,774 --> 00:16:02,400
When I was a kid...

220
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:06,696
...it felt like they made something new
every day. Some...

221
00:16:07,072 --> 00:16:10,367
...gadget or idea.
Like every day was Christmas.

222
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:13,495
But six billion people...

223
00:16:13,912 --> 00:16:15,914
...just try to imagine that.

224
00:16:16,915 --> 00:16:19,918
And every last one of them
trying to have it all.

225
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:25,215
This world isn't so bad.

226
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:29,678
And Tom will do just fine.

227
00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:34,224
You're the one who doesn't belong.
Born 40 years too late, or 40 years too early.

228
00:16:35,225 --> 00:16:37,727
My daughter knew it, God bless her.

229
00:16:38,603 --> 00:16:41,398
And your kids know it. Especially Murph.

230
00:16:41,731 --> 00:16:45,151
Well, we used to look up in the sky
and wonder...

231
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:47,696
...at our place in the stars.

232
00:16:50,115 --> 00:16:54,494
Now we just look down and worry
about our place in the dirt.

233
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:57,831
Cooper, you were good at something...

234
00:16:58,164 --> 00:17:00,667
...and you never got a chance
to do anything with it.

235
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:02,794
I'm sorry.

236
00:17:04,504 --> 00:17:05,922
<i>You didn't expect...</i>

237
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:08,633
...this dirt that was giving you this food...

238
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:12,053
...to turn on you like that and destroy you.

239
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:16,683
In April-- I believe I'm right--
Fifteenth of April, I think.

240
00:17:17,142 --> 00:17:19,436
This happened about 1:30 when that thing...

241
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:21,521
...came off the top of that canyon.

242
00:17:23,231 --> 00:17:25,358
In my day, we had real ballplayers.

243
00:17:25,525 --> 00:17:27,277
Who are these bums?

244
00:17:27,652 --> 00:17:30,155
In my day, people were too busy...

245
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:32,365
...fighting over food to even play baseball.

246
00:17:32,657 --> 00:17:37,537
Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural.
I want a hot dog.

247
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:39,831
School says you're gonna follow
in my footsteps.

248
00:17:40,582 --> 00:17:42,083
I think that's great.

249
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:45,670
- You think that's great?
- You hate farming, Dad.

250
00:17:46,463 --> 00:17:48,089
Grandpa said.

251
00:17:48,256 --> 00:17:49,674
Grandpa said, huh?

252
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:52,635
Listen, all that matters
is how you feel about it.

253
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:54,471
I like what you do.

254
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,681
I like our farm.

255
00:17:57,348 --> 00:17:58,975
You're gonna be great at it.

256
00:18:11,821 --> 00:18:13,323
Let's get out of here.

257
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,582
All right, it's a doozy.

258
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,126
All right, gang, let's mask up.

259
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:30,465
- Tom? Murph? Check?
- Yeah.

260
00:19:24,018 --> 00:19:26,604
Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows?

261
00:19:31,025 --> 00:19:32,110
Murph?

262
00:19:53,506 --> 00:19:54,799
The ghost.

263
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,677
Grab your pillow.

264
00:19:58,469 --> 00:20:00,305
You're sleeping in with Tom.

265
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:56,903
It's not a ghost.

266
00:21:02,325 --> 00:21:03,743
It's gravity.

267
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:07,747
I'm dropping Tom, then heading to town.

268
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:12,210
You want to clean that up
when you've finished praying to it?

269
00:21:37,568 --> 00:21:39,821
It's not Morse, Murph. It's binary.

270
00:21:40,321 --> 00:21:42,281
Thick is one, thin is zero.

271
00:21:46,744 --> 00:21:48,079
Coordinates.

272
00:21:50,665 --> 00:21:53,167
Nope. Mm-mm.

273
00:21:54,627 --> 00:21:55,795
Here we go.

274
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,756
Thirty-three.

275
00:22:01,718 --> 00:22:02,760
That's it.

276
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,722
I can't miss this!

277
00:22:06,055 --> 00:22:09,225
Grandpa will be back in a couple hours, Murph.

278
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:12,687
But you don't know what you're gonna find.

279
00:22:13,688 --> 00:22:15,023
And that...

280
00:22:16,107 --> 00:22:18,192
...is why I can't take you.

281
00:22:24,282 --> 00:22:25,408
Murph?

282
00:22:27,493 --> 00:22:30,997
Grandpa will be home in a while.
Tell him I'll call him on the radio.

283
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,421
- Aah!
- Jesus.

284
00:22:39,422 --> 00:22:41,340
- What are you doing?
- Heh-heh.

285
00:22:41,507 --> 00:22:43,634
Oh, you think this is funny? Huh?

286
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,304
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.

287
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:50,141
Make yourself useful.

288
00:23:53,496 --> 00:23:54,831
Hey, Murph?

289
00:23:56,457 --> 00:23:57,500
Murph!

290
00:24:01,003 --> 00:24:03,339
I think this is the end of the road.

291
00:24:06,342 --> 00:24:08,386
Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?

292
00:24:09,554 --> 00:24:10,805
That's my girl.

293
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:39,792
Step away!

294
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:43,045
Don't shoot! I'm not armed.
My daughter's in the car.

295
00:24:48,593 --> 00:24:50,845
- Don't be afraid.
- Aah!

296
00:25:03,566 --> 00:25:05,651
How did you find this place?

297
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,695
Where's my daughter?

298
00:25:07,987 --> 00:25:11,908
You had the coordinates for this facility
marked on your map. Where did you get them?

299
00:25:12,074 --> 00:25:13,409
Where's my daughter?

300
00:25:13,576 --> 00:25:16,495
Don't make me take you down again.
Sit down!

301
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:19,040
Oh, you still think you're a Marine, pal?

302
00:25:19,207 --> 00:25:21,792
Marines don't exist anymore.

303
00:25:22,084 --> 00:25:27,048
- And I got grunts like you mowing my grass.
- Where did you find those coordinates?

304
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:29,800
But you don't look much like a lawnmower.

305
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:32,803
Think I'll turn you
into an overqualified vacuum cleaner.

306
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,180
No, you won't.

307
00:25:35,806 --> 00:25:37,725
TARS, back down, please.

308
00:25:39,227 --> 00:25:42,355
You know, you're taking a risk
using ex-military security.

309
00:25:42,813 --> 00:25:46,651
They're old, and their control units
are unpredictable.

310
00:25:46,817 --> 00:25:48,819
It's what the government could spare.

311
00:25:50,488 --> 00:25:51,656
Who are you?

312
00:25:52,114 --> 00:25:53,449
Dr. Brand.

313
00:25:53,616 --> 00:25:55,993
I knew a Dr. Brand once. He was a professor.

314
00:25:56,369 --> 00:25:57,870
What makes you think I'm not?

315
00:25:58,329 --> 00:26:00,665
Wasn't near as cute, either.

316
00:26:00,998 --> 00:26:03,501
Please, Dr. Brand.
I don't have any idea what this is.

317
00:26:04,335 --> 00:26:06,837
Now I'm scared for my daughter
and want her by my side.

318
00:26:07,004 --> 00:26:09,465
You give me that,
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

319
00:26:12,843 --> 00:26:15,846
Get the principals and the girl
in the conference room, please.

320
00:26:17,181 --> 00:26:18,557
Your daughter is fine.

321
00:26:19,016 --> 00:26:20,059
Bright kid.

322
00:26:20,643 --> 00:26:22,478
Must have a very smart mother.

323
00:26:22,645 --> 00:26:25,064
It's pretty clear you don't want any visitors.

324
00:26:25,231 --> 00:26:29,193
So why don't you just let us back up from
your fence and we'll be on our way? Huh?

325
00:26:29,485 --> 00:26:32,029
- It's not that simple.
- Well, sure, it is.

326
00:26:32,363 --> 00:26:36,033
I don't know anything about you.
I don't know anything about this place.

327
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:38,077
Yes, you do.

328
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:44,875
Dad!

329
00:26:47,545 --> 00:26:48,587
Hello, Cooper.

330
00:26:50,047 --> 00:26:51,090
Professor Brand.

331
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:55,219
Explain to me how you found this facility.

332
00:26:55,386 --> 00:26:58,681
Kind of an accident. We sort of stumbled
upon it. We were on a salvage run--

333
00:26:58,848 --> 00:27:01,559
You're sitting in the best-kept secret
in the world.

334
00:27:01,726 --> 00:27:05,229
Nobody stumbles in here.
Nobody stumbles out.

335
00:27:05,563 --> 00:27:07,231
Cooper, please.

336
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,775
Cooperate with these people.

337
00:27:09,942 --> 00:27:11,152
Look.

338
00:27:12,069 --> 00:27:13,738
It's kind of hard to explain.

339
00:27:14,071 --> 00:27:18,242
We learned these coordinates
from an anomaly.

340
00:27:18,993 --> 00:27:20,328
What sort of anomaly?

341
00:27:20,494 --> 00:27:23,789
I hesitate to term it supernatural,
but it definitely wasn't scientific.

342
00:27:23,956 --> 00:27:27,877
You're going to have to be specific,
Mr. Cooper. Right now.

343
00:27:28,044 --> 00:27:29,295
It was gravity.

344
00:27:32,965 --> 00:27:37,178
Um, what sort of gravitational anomaly?
Where was this?

345
00:27:37,345 --> 00:27:40,639
Now, I'm real happy that you're excited
about gravity, bud...

346
00:27:40,806 --> 00:27:44,018
...but you're not getting any answers from us
until I get assurances.

347
00:27:44,185 --> 00:27:45,478
- Assurances?
- Yeah.

348
00:27:46,312 --> 00:27:49,774
Like, that we're getting out of here.
And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.

349
00:27:52,318 --> 00:27:54,445
Don't you know who we are, Coop?

350
00:27:54,612 --> 00:27:55,863
No, professor, I don't.

351
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:58,032
You know my father, Professor Brand.

352
00:27:58,657 --> 00:27:59,950
We're NASA.

353
00:28:01,744 --> 00:28:03,954
- NASA?
- NASA.

354
00:28:04,288 --> 00:28:06,082
The same NASA you flew for.

355
00:28:17,134 --> 00:28:18,803
I heard they shut you down, sir...

356
00:28:18,969 --> 00:28:21,263
...for refusing to drop bombs
from the stratosphere...

357
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,973
...onto starving people.

358
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,476
When they realized
that killing other people was...

359
00:28:25,643 --> 00:28:28,479
...not a long-term solution,
then they needed us back.

360
00:28:28,646 --> 00:28:30,648
- In secret.
- Why secret?

361
00:28:30,815 --> 00:28:34,652
Because public opinion wouldn't
allow spending on space exploration.

362
00:28:35,111 --> 00:28:37,405
Not while you're struggling
to put food on the table.

363
00:28:38,823 --> 00:28:39,990
Blight.

364
00:28:40,449 --> 00:28:44,286
Wheat seven years ago. Okra this year.

365
00:28:45,037 --> 00:28:46,705
Now there's just corn.

366
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,999
And we're growing more than we ever have.

367
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:53,337
But like the potatoes in Ireland
and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...

368
00:28:53,921 --> 00:28:56,424
...the corn will die.

369
00:28:57,174 --> 00:28:58,217
Soon.

370
00:29:03,514 --> 00:29:07,101
We'll find a way, professor. We always have.

371
00:29:07,852 --> 00:29:11,856
Driven by the unshakable faith
the Earth is ours.

372
00:29:12,356 --> 00:29:14,233
Not just ours, no.

373
00:29:15,025 --> 00:29:16,360
But it is our home.

374
00:29:17,695 --> 00:29:21,031
Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.

375
00:29:21,198 --> 00:29:22,908
We don't even breathe nitrogen.

376
00:29:23,075 --> 00:29:28,414
Blight does. And as it thrives,
our air gets less and less oxygen.

377
00:29:28,581 --> 00:29:32,042
The last people to starve
will be the first to suffocate.

378
00:29:32,209 --> 00:29:34,378
And your daughter's generation...

379
00:29:36,046 --> 00:29:38,299
...will be the last to survive on Earth.

380
00:29:38,466 --> 00:29:42,052
Murph is tired. I was wondering
if she could take a nap in my office.

381
00:29:42,553 --> 00:29:44,054
Yeah. Thank you.

382
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:47,892
Okay...

383
00:29:48,893 --> 00:29:52,396
...now you need to tell me
what your plan is to save the world.

384
00:29:53,063 --> 00:29:56,567
We're not meant to save the world.
We're meant to leave it.

385
00:30:02,406 --> 00:30:03,449
Rangers.

386
00:30:03,741 --> 00:30:08,704
<i>The last components of our one versatile ship
in orbit, the Endurance.</i>

387
00:30:08,996 --> 00:30:10,623
Our final expedition.

388
00:30:11,415 --> 00:30:14,376
You sent people out there
looking for a new home?

389
00:30:15,002 --> 00:30:16,295
The Lazarus missions.

390
00:30:16,629 --> 00:30:19,590
- Oh, that sounds cheerful.
- Lazarus came back from the dead.

391
00:30:19,924 --> 00:30:21,926
Sure, but he had to die in the first place.

392
00:30:22,551 --> 00:30:25,262
There's not a planet in our solar system
that could sustain life...

393
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:27,932
...and the nearest star's
over a thousand years away.

394
00:30:28,098 --> 00:30:30,768
That doesn't even qualify as futile.

395
00:30:32,436 --> 00:30:33,771
Where'd you send them?

396
00:30:34,188 --> 00:30:35,606
Cooper...

397
00:30:35,773 --> 00:30:38,567
...I can't tell you anymore unless you agree...

398
00:30:38,734 --> 00:30:40,569
...to pilot this craft.

399
00:30:40,736 --> 00:30:44,031
- You're the best pilot we ever had.
- I barely left the stratosphere.

400
00:30:44,323 --> 00:30:46,450
This team never left the simulator.

401
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:50,579
We need a pilot, and this is the mission
that you were trained for.

402
00:30:50,746 --> 00:30:52,248
Without even knowing it?

403
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:57,545
An hour ago, you didn't even know I was alive.
You were going anyway.

404
00:30:57,711 --> 00:30:59,421
We had no choice.

405
00:30:59,588 --> 00:31:01,340
But something sent you here.

406
00:31:01,674 --> 00:31:04,385
- They chose you.
- Who's "they"?

407
00:31:12,351 --> 00:31:14,270
How long would I be gone?

408
00:31:14,853 --> 00:31:17,773
Hard to know. Years?

409
00:31:18,482 --> 00:31:20,109
I've got kids, professor.

410
00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:22,653
Get out there and save them.

411
00:31:26,031 --> 00:31:27,408
Who's "they"?

412
00:31:27,575 --> 00:31:31,370
We started detecting gravitational anomalies
almost 50 years ago.

413
00:31:31,704 --> 00:31:35,332
Mostly small distortions to our instruments
in the upper atmosphere.

414
00:31:35,499 --> 00:31:38,627
In fact, I believe
you encountered one yourself.

415
00:31:39,295 --> 00:31:41,297
Yeah, over the Straights.

416
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:45,342
My crash. Something tripped my fly-by-wire.

417
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:46,719
Exactly.

418
00:31:47,553 --> 00:31:52,474
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this:

419
00:31:52,641 --> 00:31:54,643
Out near Saturn...

420
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,895
...a disturbance of space-time.

421
00:31:59,023 --> 00:32:02,151
- Is that a wormhole?
- It appeared 48 years ago.

422
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,528
And it leads where?

423
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,697
Another galaxy.

424
00:32:08,449 --> 00:32:10,701
A wormhole's not
a naturally occurring phenomenon.

425
00:32:10,868 --> 00:32:12,286
Someone placed it there.

426
00:32:13,078 --> 00:32:14,580
- "They"?
- Mm.

427
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,168
And whoever they are,
they appear to be looking out for us.

428
00:32:19,627 --> 00:32:22,212
That wormhole lets us travel to other stars.

429
00:32:22,379 --> 00:32:24,298
It came along right as we needed it.

430
00:32:24,465 --> 00:32:27,384
They've put potentially habitable worlds
right within our reach.

431
00:32:27,551 --> 00:32:29,470
Twelve, in fact, from our initial probes.

432
00:32:29,637 --> 00:32:32,014
- You sent probes into that?
- Mm-hm.

433
00:32:32,181 --> 00:32:35,184
We sent people into it. Ten years ago.

434
00:32:36,518 --> 00:32:38,187
The Lazarus missions.

435
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,730
Twelve possible worlds...

436
00:32:39,897 --> 00:32:42,232
...twelve Ranger launches carrying...

437
00:32:42,691 --> 00:32:45,110
...the bravest humans ever to live...

438
00:32:45,277 --> 00:32:47,905
...led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

439
00:32:48,405 --> 00:32:51,408
Each person's landing pod
had enough life support for two years.

440
00:32:51,575 --> 00:32:53,535
But they could use hibernation
to stretch that...

441
00:32:53,702 --> 00:32:56,914
...making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

442
00:32:57,081 --> 00:33:00,918
Their mission was to assess their world,
and if it showed potential...

443
00:33:01,251 --> 00:33:05,673
...then they could send out a signal,
bed down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.

444
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:07,883
And what if the world didn't show promise?

445
00:33:08,509 --> 00:33:09,927
Hence the bravery.

446
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:13,263
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12.

447
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,556
No.

448
00:33:15,432 --> 00:33:18,227
Data transmission back through
the wormhole is rudimentary.

449
00:33:18,394 --> 00:33:23,440
Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us
some clue as to which worlds have potential.

450
00:33:23,607 --> 00:33:25,401
And one system shows promise.

451
00:33:25,734 --> 00:33:28,278
One. That's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?

452
00:33:29,113 --> 00:33:31,949
One system with three potential worlds?

453
00:33:32,366 --> 00:33:33,951
No long shot.

454
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,246
Okay.

455
00:33:37,955 --> 00:33:40,290
So if we find a home...

456
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,422
- ...then what?
- That's the long shot.

457
00:33:46,755 --> 00:33:49,967
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

458
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:53,429
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

459
00:34:05,149 --> 00:34:08,068
This entire facility's a centrifuge.

460
00:34:08,402 --> 00:34:10,904
Some kind of vehicle. A space station?

461
00:34:11,238 --> 00:34:12,990
Both. Plan A.

462
00:34:13,157 --> 00:34:15,242
How do you get it off the ground?

463
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:19,079
The first gravitational anomalies
changed everything.

464
00:34:19,413 --> 00:34:23,751
Suddenly we knew
that harnessing gravity was real.

465
00:34:24,084 --> 00:34:28,756
So I started working on a theory
and we started building this station.

466
00:34:29,131 --> 00:34:31,216
But you haven't solved it yet.

467
00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:33,844
That's why there's Plan B.

468
00:34:34,344 --> 00:34:39,057
The problem is gravity. How to get
a viable amount of human life off the planet.

469
00:34:39,224 --> 00:34:40,517
This is one way.

470
00:34:40,851 --> 00:34:43,353
Plan B: a population bomb.

471
00:34:43,687 --> 00:34:48,442
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

472
00:34:49,151 --> 00:34:50,652
How would you raise them?

473
00:34:50,819 --> 00:34:53,280
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

474
00:34:53,447 --> 00:34:57,326
After that, with surrogacy,
the growth becomes exponential.

475
00:34:58,035 --> 00:35:01,330
Within 30 years,
we could have a colony of hundreds.

476
00:35:01,497 --> 00:35:04,875
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

477
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:07,044
This takes care of that.

478
00:35:07,211 --> 00:35:09,671
But what about the people here? You just...

479
00:35:10,047 --> 00:35:11,381
...give up on them?

480
00:35:12,007 --> 00:35:13,258
My kids?

481
00:35:13,801 --> 00:35:17,137
That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

482
00:35:19,389 --> 00:35:22,267
- How far have you got?
- Almost there.

483
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:24,853
You're asking me to hang everything...

484
00:35:25,896 --> 00:35:27,231
...on an almost.

485
00:35:27,773 --> 00:35:30,067
I'm asking you to trust me.

486
00:35:33,153 --> 00:35:34,822
Find us a new home.

487
00:35:35,572 --> 00:35:37,574
And by the time you return...

488
00:35:38,158 --> 00:35:40,828
...I will have solved the problem of gravity.

489
00:35:41,787 --> 00:35:43,372
I give you my word.

490
00:35:56,009 --> 00:35:57,511
Go away!

491
00:36:08,188 --> 00:36:09,231
Murph.

492
00:36:09,606 --> 00:36:12,609
Go! If you're leaving, just go.

493
00:36:15,404 --> 00:36:18,240
This world was never enough
for you, was it, Coop?

494
00:36:19,074 --> 00:36:22,828
What, because heading out there
is what I feel like I was born to do?

495
00:36:23,787 --> 00:36:25,622
And it excites me? Heh.

496
00:36:26,331 --> 00:36:28,792
No, that does not make it wrong.

497
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:30,085
It might.

498
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,589
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

499
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:36,675
The why of the thing, that's the foundation.

500
00:36:36,842 --> 00:36:38,927
And the foundation's solid.

501
00:36:42,097 --> 00:36:47,102
We farmers, we sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say:

502
00:36:47,394 --> 00:36:48,645
"Next year."

503
00:36:49,313 --> 00:36:52,983
Well, next year ain't gonna save us,
nor the one after that.

504
00:36:53,817 --> 00:36:57,946
This world's a treasure, Donald,
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.

505
00:37:02,659 --> 00:37:06,455
Mankind was born on Earth,
it was never meant to die here.

506
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:12,794
Tom will be all right,
but you got to make things right with Murph.

507
00:37:12,961 --> 00:37:14,004
I will.

508
00:37:14,963 --> 00:37:18,133
Without making promises
you don't know you can keep.

509
00:37:28,769 --> 00:37:30,771
You have to talk to me, Murph.

510
00:37:33,273 --> 00:37:35,400
I need to fix this before I go.

511
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:38,445
Then I'll keep it broken so you have to stay.

512
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:45,035
After you kids came along, your mom said
something to me I never quite understood.

513
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,037
She said, "Now...

514
00:37:48,914 --> 00:37:53,418
...we're just here
to be memories for our kids."

515
00:37:58,548 --> 00:38:01,051
And I think that now I understand
what she meant.

516
00:38:04,805 --> 00:38:08,558
Once you're a parent,
you're the ghost of your children's future.

517
00:38:10,185 --> 00:38:12,354
You said ghosts didn't exist.

518
00:38:18,819 --> 00:38:20,320
That's right, Murph.

519
00:38:23,532 --> 00:38:24,866
Murph, look at me.

520
00:38:27,911 --> 00:38:30,414
I can't be your ghost right now.

521
00:38:32,207 --> 00:38:34,209
I need to exist.

522
00:38:35,836 --> 00:38:37,754
They chose me.

523
00:38:38,463 --> 00:38:42,426
Murph, they chose me. You saw.
You're the one who led me to them.

524
00:38:45,053 --> 00:38:47,556
That's exactly why you can't go.

525
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:52,728
I figured out the message.

526
00:38:53,145 --> 00:38:56,356
- One word. Know what it is?
- Murph.

527
00:38:56,523 --> 00:38:57,858
"Stay."

528
00:38:58,233 --> 00:39:01,111
- It says, "Stay," Dad.
- Murph.

529
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,530
You don't believe me.

530
00:39:03,697 --> 00:39:06,491
Look at the books! Look at this.
It says, "Stay."

531
00:39:06,658 --> 00:39:09,619
Why--? You're not listening! It says, "Stay!"

532
00:39:09,953 --> 00:39:11,788
No, I'm coming back.

533
00:39:11,955 --> 00:39:13,290
When?

534
00:39:26,303 --> 00:39:28,764
One for you, one for me.

535
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:32,309
When I'm up there in hypersleep, or...

536
00:39:32,642 --> 00:39:35,187
...traveling near the speed of light, or...

537
00:39:36,188 --> 00:39:38,315
...near a black hole...

538
00:39:38,774 --> 00:39:43,320
...time's gonna change for me.
It's gonna run more slowly.

539
00:39:44,905 --> 00:39:46,698
When we get back...

540
00:39:47,824 --> 00:39:49,242
...we're gonna compare.

541
00:39:49,409 --> 00:39:52,037
- Time will run differently for us?
- Yeah.

542
00:39:53,121 --> 00:39:57,793
By the time I get back,
we might even be the same age, you and me.

543
00:39:58,168 --> 00:40:00,504
"What?" Imagine that!

544
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,218
Aw, Murph....

545
00:40:06,384 --> 00:40:09,012
You have no idea when you're coming back.

546
00:40:10,806 --> 00:40:12,307
No idea at all!

547
00:40:15,435 --> 00:40:17,562
Murph, don't-- Don't make me leave like this.

548
00:40:17,729 --> 00:40:19,231
Come on, Murph!

549
00:40:19,731 --> 00:40:22,067
Don't make me leave like this, Murph!

550
00:40:29,658 --> 00:40:30,700
Hey...

551
00:40:31,243 --> 00:40:32,577
...I love you.

552
00:40:32,953 --> 00:40:34,871
Forever. You hear me?

553
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:38,542
I love you forever, and I'm coming back.

554
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:45,674
I'm coming back.

555
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,069
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

556
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,280
Just fine.

557
00:41:14,744 --> 00:41:15,871
I love you, Tom.

558
00:41:16,413 --> 00:41:18,540
- Travel safe, huh?
- Yeah.

559
00:41:18,707 --> 00:41:20,959
You look after our place for me, all right?

560
00:41:21,126 --> 00:41:22,752
- All right?
- Uh-huh.

561
00:41:27,257 --> 00:41:30,635
- Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?
- You mean your truck?

562
00:41:32,137 --> 00:41:33,763
I'll make sure they bring it back.

563
00:41:35,891 --> 00:41:37,684
Look after my kids, Donald!

564
00:41:50,155 --> 00:41:53,783
<i>Go for main engine start. T-minus 10...</i>

565
00:41:54,451 --> 00:41:56,536
<i>- Dad!
- ...nine...</i>

566
00:41:56,703 --> 00:41:57,954
Dad!

567
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,623
<i>...eight...</i>

568
00:42:00,957 --> 00:42:02,042
<i>...seven...</i>

569
00:42:02,209 --> 00:42:03,460
Dad!

570
00:42:03,793 --> 00:42:04,836
<i>...six...</i>

571
00:42:06,213 --> 00:42:09,132
<i>...five, main engine start, four...</i>

572
00:42:10,467 --> 00:42:11,635
<i>...three...</i>

573
00:42:12,302 --> 00:42:13,428
<i>...two...</i>

574
00:42:14,346 --> 00:42:16,431
<i>...one. Booster ignition and....</i>

575
00:42:25,899 --> 00:42:28,360
All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.

576
00:42:32,656 --> 00:42:35,492
Prepare for stage one separation.

577
00:42:35,825 --> 00:42:36,868
Stage one.

578
00:42:42,832 --> 00:42:44,668
There is Mach 1.

579
00:42:45,627 --> 00:42:49,339
Everybody good?
Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?

580
00:42:51,216 --> 00:42:54,511
They gave him a humor setting
so he'd fit in better with his unit.

581
00:42:54,844 --> 00:42:56,513
He thinks it relaxes us.

582
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,474
A giant sarcastic robot.

583
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:01,768
What a great idea!

584
00:43:01,935 --> 00:43:04,646
I have a cue light I can use
when I'm joking if you like.

585
00:43:04,813 --> 00:43:05,855
That'd probably help.

586
00:43:06,022 --> 00:43:09,943
You can use it to find your way back
to the ship after I blow you out the airlock.

587
00:43:11,027 --> 00:43:14,030
- What's your humor setting, TARS?
- That's 100 percent.

588
00:43:14,197 --> 00:43:15,991
Let's bring it on down to 75, please.

589
00:43:16,324 --> 00:43:18,159
Stage two separation.

590
00:43:28,837 --> 00:43:31,006
All feeds going manual.

591
00:43:31,298 --> 00:43:32,716
Going manual.

592
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,178
Deactivate probe heater one, two and three.

593
00:43:37,345 --> 00:43:38,388
Check.

594
00:43:43,977 --> 00:43:46,896
- Taking control.
- This is handover to you.

595
00:43:50,734 --> 00:43:53,028
- A.D.F. check.
- Over.

596
00:43:53,361 --> 00:43:57,032
Pull thrusters back.
Fuel cells one, two, three.

597
00:43:57,198 --> 00:43:58,533
One hundred percent.

598
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,535
Ex-mites.

599
00:44:09,502 --> 00:44:11,338
It's hard leaving everything.

600
00:44:11,713 --> 00:44:14,215
My kids. Your father.

601
00:44:14,841 --> 00:44:17,218
We're going to be spending
a lot of time together.

602
00:44:17,385 --> 00:44:20,430
- We should learn to talk.
- And when not to.

603
00:44:22,724 --> 00:44:24,267
Just being honest.

604
00:44:24,434 --> 00:44:26,770
I don't think you need to be that honest.

605
00:44:27,187 --> 00:44:29,606
Hey, TARS, what's your honesty parameter?

606
00:44:29,773 --> 00:44:32,400
- Ninety percent.
- Ninety percent?

607
00:44:32,567 --> 00:44:35,612
Absolute honesty isn't always
the most diplomatic, nor the...

608
00:44:35,779 --> 00:44:38,365
...safest form of communication
with emotional beings.

609
00:44:38,531 --> 00:44:39,991
Okay.

610
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:43,078
Ninety percent it is, Dr. Brand.

611
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:50,001
<i>We are coming up on the Endurance.
Twelve minutes out.</i>

612
00:45:07,102 --> 00:45:09,104
Okay. Taking control.

613
00:45:12,565 --> 00:45:15,443
Approaching module port, 500 meters.

614
00:45:28,456 --> 00:45:29,582
It's all you, Doyle.

615
00:45:48,143 --> 00:45:50,603
Nice and easy, Doyle. Nice and easy.

616
00:45:55,775 --> 00:45:57,026
I feel good.

617
00:45:57,193 --> 00:45:58,361
Take us home.

618
00:46:06,161 --> 00:46:08,496
- Lock.
- Target locked.

619
00:46:08,663 --> 00:46:10,498
- Well done.
- Okay, helmets on.

620
00:46:10,665 --> 00:46:11,708
Good job.

621
00:46:45,158 --> 00:46:46,910
Door's not charging.

622
00:46:47,076 --> 00:46:48,578
Never mind.

623
00:47:11,351 --> 00:47:13,061
Cooper, you should have control.

624
00:47:13,394 --> 00:47:14,896
Control here.

625
00:47:16,314 --> 00:47:18,942
<i>Communication with ring module active.</i>

626
00:47:25,406 --> 00:47:26,950
Oh, wow.

627
00:47:32,747 --> 00:47:33,915
That's initiate.

628
00:47:41,464 --> 00:47:43,967
<i>- Are we ready to spin?
- Just a sec.</i>

629
00:47:55,395 --> 00:47:57,730
- Hello, CASE.
- Hello, TARS.

630
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:00,608
All right, we're all set.

631
00:48:01,067 --> 00:48:02,569
All right, let's do it.

632
00:48:20,878 --> 00:48:22,380
Heh.

633
00:48:31,723 --> 00:48:33,016
<i>Thirty percent of spin.</i>

634
00:48:39,939 --> 00:48:41,274
<i>One G.</i>

00:48:42,025 --> 00:48:44,027
<i>How's gravity treating you back there?</i>

636
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,528
Well.

637
00:48:48,698 --> 00:48:50,491
Romilly? Hey, you okay?

638
00:48:50,658 --> 00:48:51,701
- Yeah.
- You all right?

639
00:48:51,868 --> 00:48:53,953
Mm. Yeah, I just need a minute.

640
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:59,042
We have some Dramamine in the hab pod,
or maybe in the cryo-beds. I'll just be a sec.

641
00:48:59,208 --> 00:49:01,377
- Hey, Brand?
- Yeah?

642
00:49:01,711 --> 00:49:03,546
- Bring a lot.
- Heh-heh-heh.

643
00:49:12,013 --> 00:49:14,891
<i>Amelia, be safe.</i>

644
00:49:15,224 --> 00:49:18,728
<i>- Give my regards to Dr. Mann.
- I will, Dad.</i>

645
00:49:18,895 --> 00:49:20,813
<i>It looks good for your trajectory.</i>

646
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:24,317
<i>We've calculated two years to Saturn.</i>

647
00:49:25,068 --> 00:49:26,569
That's a lot of Dramamine.

648
00:49:27,278 --> 00:49:29,739
Look after my family, will you, please, sir?

649
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:33,076
<i>We'll be waiting for you when you get back.</i>

650
00:49:33,576 --> 00:49:37,413
<i>A little older, a little wiser,
but happy to see you.</i>

651
00:49:40,249 --> 00:49:43,586
<i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>

652
00:49:44,253 --> 00:49:48,299
<i>Old age should burn and rave at close of day</i>

653
00:49:49,467 --> 00:49:54,430
<i>Rage, rage against the dying of the light</i>

654
00:49:55,306 --> 00:49:59,102
<i>Though wise men at their end
Know dark is right</i>

655
00:49:59,435 --> 00:50:02,313
<i>Because their words had forked
No lightning they</i>

656
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:06,275
<i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>

657
00:50:06,943 --> 00:50:11,280
<i>Rage, rage against the dying of the light</i>

658
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,549
- You good?
- Yeah.

659
00:50:30,466 --> 00:50:31,968
Okay, thank you.

660
00:50:35,471 --> 00:50:36,806
Here. Pills.

661
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:40,977
So alone.

662
00:50:41,477 --> 00:50:43,438
We have each other. Dr. Mann had it worse.

663
00:50:43,604 --> 00:50:44,981
No, I mean them.

664
00:50:45,148 --> 00:50:46,274
Hm?

665
00:50:46,441 --> 00:50:49,736
It's a perfect planet,
and we won't find another one like her.

666
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:53,573
No, it's not like looking for a new condo.

667
00:50:54,699 --> 00:50:56,868
The human race is going to be...

668
00:50:57,368 --> 00:50:58,411
...adrift...

669
00:50:58,578 --> 00:51:02,081
...desperate for a rock it can cling to
while it catches its breath.

670
00:51:02,665 --> 00:51:04,500
We need to find that rock.

671
00:51:04,834 --> 00:51:07,545
And our three prospects
are at the edge of what...

672
00:51:07,712 --> 00:51:09,589
...might sustain human life.

673
00:51:10,089 --> 00:51:12,550
Laura Miller's planet is first.

674
00:51:12,717 --> 00:51:14,844
- Laura started our biology program.
Mm-hm.

675
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:23,019
- Uh, Wolf Edmunds is here.
- Tell me about Edmunds.

676
00:51:23,853 --> 00:51:26,606
Oh, uh, Wolf's a particle physicist.

677
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,235
None of them had families, huh?

678
00:51:32,278 --> 00:51:35,156
No. No attachments. My father insisted.

679
00:51:35,323 --> 00:51:38,868
They all knew the odds against
ever seeing another human being again.

680
00:51:39,035 --> 00:51:40,995
I'm hoping we can surprise
at least three of them.

681
00:51:41,162 --> 00:51:43,080
- How about Mann?
- Dr. Mann?

682
00:51:43,247 --> 00:51:45,166
He's remarkable. He's the best of us.

683
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:49,712
He inspired 11 people to follow him
on the loneliest journey in human history.

684
00:51:49,879 --> 00:51:51,464
Scientists, explorers.

685
00:51:51,631 --> 00:51:55,718
That's what I love.
You know, out there we face great odds.

686
00:51:56,219 --> 00:51:57,637
Death, but...

687
00:51:59,388 --> 00:52:00,723
...not evil.

688
00:52:01,015 --> 00:52:02,767
You don't think nature can be evil?

689
00:52:03,142 --> 00:52:05,812
No. Formidable. Frightening. But...

690
00:52:06,604 --> 00:52:08,606
- ...no, not evil.
- Hm.

691
00:52:09,857 --> 00:52:13,069
Is a lion evil
because it rips a gazelle to shreds?

692
00:52:13,569 --> 00:52:15,571
Just what we take with us, then.

693
00:52:16,113 --> 00:52:17,156
Yeah.

694
00:52:17,573 --> 00:52:19,659
This crew represents the best of humanity.

695
00:52:19,826 --> 00:52:20,993
Even me, huh?

696
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,162
You know what? We agreed, 90 percent.

697
00:52:23,329 --> 00:52:24,413
There you go.

698
00:52:24,831 --> 00:52:27,208
- Don't stay up.
- I'll be there in a minute.

699
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:31,420
Just remember, Coop,
you are literally wasting your breath.

700
00:52:38,094 --> 00:52:41,264
Hey, TARS?
Let's go over that trajectory one more time.

701
00:52:41,597 --> 00:52:43,266
Eight months to Mars.

702
00:52:43,766 --> 00:52:46,602
Counter-orbital slingshot around.
Fourteen months to Saturn.

703
00:52:46,769 --> 00:52:48,187
Nothing's changed on that.

704
00:52:48,354 --> 00:52:50,439
Just let me ask you something.

705
00:52:52,692 --> 00:52:56,153
- Dr. Brand and Edmunds--
- Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.

706
00:52:57,613 --> 00:53:00,616
Dr. Brand and Edmunds. They close?

707
00:53:00,783 --> 00:53:02,201
I wouldn't know.

708
00:53:02,368 --> 00:53:05,371
Is that 90 percent "wouldn't know"
or 10 percent "wouldn't know"?

709
00:53:05,538 --> 00:53:08,666
- I also have a discretion setting, Cooper.
- Aah.

710
00:53:10,126 --> 00:53:12,295
But not a poker face, Slick.

711
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,892
Hey, guys.

712
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:29,395
Uh, Dad's about to go down for the long nap.

713
00:53:29,729 --> 00:53:32,356
<i>So I wanted to give you an update.</i>

714
00:53:32,523 --> 00:53:33,649
<i>Uh....</i>

715
00:53:34,191 --> 00:53:37,904
<i>The Earth looks amazing from here. Um....</i>

716
00:53:38,446 --> 00:53:41,282
<i>You can't see any of the dust. Heh.</i>

717
00:53:41,449 --> 00:53:45,578
<i>Um, I really hope you guys are doing great.</i>

718
00:53:45,912 --> 00:53:50,166
<i>I know you'll get this message.
Professor Brand's assured me he'll get it to you.</i>

719
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:52,752
<i>Know that I love you.</i>

720
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:56,505
- Is it him?
- I don't think so, Murph.

721
00:54:03,387 --> 00:54:05,056
You must be Donald.

722
00:54:07,266 --> 00:54:08,434
Hello, Murph.

723
00:54:09,185 --> 00:54:11,187
Why are you in my dad's truck?

724
00:54:11,812 --> 00:54:13,981
He wanted me to bring it for your brother.

725
00:54:14,732 --> 00:54:16,901
He sent you a message.

726
00:54:19,987 --> 00:54:21,989
She's pretty upset with him for leaving.

727
00:54:22,156 --> 00:54:26,243
If you record any messages,
I can get them to transmit it to Cooper.

728
00:54:27,328 --> 00:54:29,997
Murph is a bright spark.

729
00:54:30,998 --> 00:54:33,542
Maybe I should fan the flame.

730
00:54:33,709 --> 00:54:36,295
She's already making fools of her teachers.

731
00:54:36,462 --> 00:54:39,298
So maybe she should come
and make a fool out of you.

732
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:43,219
- So where are they?
- Heading for Mars.

733
00:54:43,928 --> 00:54:47,932
The next time you hear from Cooper,
they'll be coming up on Saturn.

734
00:55:27,888 --> 00:55:29,598
<i>As far as school goes...</i>

735
00:55:29,765 --> 00:55:32,935
<i>...the administration wants me
to repeat Plant Pathology. Which sucks.</i>

736
00:55:33,436 --> 00:55:36,647
<i>But they said I could start
Advanced Agriculture a year early.</i>

737
00:55:38,441 --> 00:55:42,319
<i>All right, I got to go, Dad.
Hope you're safe up there.</i>

738
00:55:46,365 --> 00:55:47,950
<i>Um, sorry, Coop.</i>

739
00:55:48,117 --> 00:55:52,955
<i>I asked Murph to say hi,
but she's as stubborn as her old man.</i>

740
00:55:53,372 --> 00:55:55,207
<i>I'll try again next time.</i>

741
00:56:10,222 --> 00:56:11,807
You all right, Rom?

742
00:56:14,143 --> 00:56:15,978
This gets to me, Cooper.

743
00:56:16,145 --> 00:56:17,813
This. This.

744
00:56:18,314 --> 00:56:21,192
Millimeters of aluminum, that's it,
and then nothing...

745
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:25,321
...out there for millions of miles
won't kill us in seconds.

746
00:56:26,238 --> 00:56:28,157
You know that some of the finest...

747
00:56:28,324 --> 00:56:32,161
...solo yachtsmen in the world
don't know how to swim?

748
00:56:32,745 --> 00:56:35,915
They don't know how.
And if they go overboard, psst, they're done.

749
00:56:37,666 --> 00:56:39,627
We're explorers, Rom.

750
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:42,880
This is our boat.

751
00:56:43,047 --> 00:56:44,173
Here.

752
00:57:11,283 --> 00:57:13,035
This is from the, uh, relay probe?

753
00:57:13,202 --> 00:57:15,246
It was in orbit around the wormhole.

754
00:57:15,746 --> 00:57:18,791
This is the wormhole,
and every time we'd come around...

755
00:57:18,958 --> 00:57:22,169
...we would receive images
from the other side of the foreign galaxy.

756
00:57:22,503 --> 00:57:24,630
Oh, yeah. Like swinging a periscope around.

757
00:57:24,797 --> 00:57:25,881
Exactly.

758
00:57:26,048 --> 00:57:30,553
So we got a pretty good idea
what we're gonna find on the other side, huh?

759
00:57:31,637 --> 00:57:32,972
Navigationally.

760
00:57:34,431 --> 00:57:38,185
<i>Guys? We'll be approaching
the wormhole in about three hours.</i>

761
00:57:44,567 --> 00:57:45,609
Hey, Coop?

762
00:57:46,485 --> 00:57:48,237
Can we stop the spinning?

763
00:57:48,404 --> 00:57:49,488
Why?

764
00:57:49,655 --> 00:57:51,991
Because we're close enough to see it now?

765
00:57:53,826 --> 00:57:54,952
All right.

766
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:56,203
Thanks.

767
00:58:01,959 --> 00:58:03,919
There, that's it! That's the wormhole!

768
00:58:04,086 --> 00:58:05,880
Say it, don't spray it, Rom.

769
00:58:06,255 --> 00:58:07,548
It's a sphere.

770
00:58:07,715 --> 00:58:11,677
Of course it is. What, you--?
You thought it would just be a hole?

771
00:58:12,887 --> 00:58:15,973
No, it's just that all the illustrations
I've ever seen, they....

772
00:58:16,515 --> 00:58:19,602
In the illustrations,
they're trying to show you how it works.

773
00:58:20,311 --> 00:58:24,148
So they say you want to go
from here to there.

774
00:58:24,481 --> 00:58:27,026
- But it's too far, right?
- Mm-hm.

775
00:58:27,193 --> 00:58:31,989
So a wormhole bends space like this,
so you can take a shortcut through...

776
00:58:32,323 --> 00:58:33,908
...a higher dimension.

777
00:58:34,074 --> 00:58:35,534
Okay, so...

778
00:58:35,868 --> 00:58:39,788
...to show that, they've turned
three-dimensional space into two dimensions...

779
00:58:39,955 --> 00:58:43,918
...which turns a wormhole
into two dimensions, a circle.

780
00:58:44,084 --> 00:58:46,337
What's a circle in three dimensions?

781
00:58:47,546 --> 00:58:49,048
- A sphere.
- Exactly.

782
00:58:49,465 --> 00:58:50,966
A spherical hole.

783
00:58:51,508 --> 00:58:54,345
But who put it there?
Who do we have to thank?

784
00:58:54,762 --> 00:58:59,433
I'm not thanking anybody
until we get out of here in one piece, Rom.

785
00:59:06,649 --> 00:59:08,067
Any trick to this, Doyle?

786
00:59:09,401 --> 00:59:11,070
No one knows.

787
00:59:18,202 --> 00:59:19,870
The others made it, right?

788
00:59:21,914 --> 00:59:23,582
At least some of them.

789
00:59:55,531 --> 00:59:58,701
Everybody ready to say goodbye
to our solar system?

790
00:59:59,576 --> 01:00:01,578
To our galaxy.

791
01:00:03,497 --> 01:00:04,540
Here we go.

792
01:00:37,156 --> 01:00:40,659
The controls won't work here.
We're passing through the bulk.

793
01:00:40,826 --> 01:00:45,247
It's space beyond our three dimensions.
All you can do is record and observe.

794
01:00:56,425 --> 01:00:57,468
What is that?

795
01:00:59,845 --> 01:01:01,680
I think it's them.

796
01:01:02,014 --> 01:01:03,849
Distorting space-time.

797
01:01:05,934 --> 01:01:07,019
Don't! Don't!

798
01:01:35,047 --> 01:01:36,298
What was that?

799
01:01:39,301 --> 01:01:40,803
The first handshake.

800
01:01:42,471 --> 01:01:43,514
We're....

801
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:46,475
We're here.

802
01:02:06,829 --> 01:02:09,081
So the lost communications came through.

803
01:02:09,248 --> 01:02:12,126
- How?
- The relay on this side cached them.

804
01:02:12,292 --> 01:02:15,838
So years of basic data. No real surprises.

805
01:02:16,755 --> 01:02:20,592
Miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up,
as has Dr. Mann's. Um....

806
01:02:20,759 --> 01:02:22,886
Edmunds' went down three years ago.

807
01:02:23,053 --> 01:02:24,263
Transmitter failure?

808
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:27,433
Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up
right until it went dark.

809
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:29,351
But Miller's still looks good though, right?

810
01:02:29,518 --> 01:02:31,812
- Because she's coming up fast.
Mm-hm.

811
01:02:32,271 --> 01:02:34,273
With one complication.

812
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:37,693
The planet is much closer to Gargantua
than we thought.

813
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:40,529
- Gargantua?
- It's what we're calling the black hole.

814
01:02:40,696 --> 01:02:42,990
Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets both orbit it.

815
01:02:43,157 --> 01:02:46,368
- And Miller's is on the horizon?
- As a basketball around a hoop.

816
01:02:46,535 --> 01:02:48,537
Landing there takes us dangerously close.

817
01:02:48,704 --> 01:02:51,957
And a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull.

818
01:02:54,543 --> 01:02:57,546
Look, I could swing around that neutron star
to decelerate.

819
01:02:57,713 --> 01:02:59,590
No, it's not that. It's time.

820
01:02:59,756 --> 01:03:04,261
The gravity on that planet will slow our clock
compared to Earth's drastically.

821
01:03:04,887 --> 01:03:06,054
How bad?

822
01:03:06,221 --> 01:03:09,766
Every hour we spend on that planet will be...

823
01:03:10,642 --> 01:03:12,811
...seven years back on Earth.

824
01:03:13,687 --> 01:03:14,730
Jesus.

825
01:03:15,063 --> 01:03:16,732
Well, that's relativity, folks.

826
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:20,611
Well, we can't just drop down
there without....

827
01:03:20,777 --> 01:03:22,654
Cooper, we have a mission.

828
01:03:22,821 --> 01:03:25,407
Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission,
and our mission Plan A is...

829
01:03:25,574 --> 01:03:28,744
...to find a planet that can habitate
the people that are living on Earth now.

830
01:03:28,911 --> 01:03:31,747
You can't just think about your family.
Now you have to think bigger.

831
01:03:31,914 --> 01:03:35,125
I am thinking about my family
and millions of other families, okay?

832
01:03:35,292 --> 01:03:39,546
Plan A does not work if the people on Earth
are dead by the time we pull it off.

833
01:03:40,839 --> 01:03:42,508
No. It doesn't.

834
01:03:42,841 --> 01:03:44,510
That's why there's a Plan B.

835
01:03:46,428 --> 01:03:47,930
Okay. Cooper's right.

836
01:03:48,096 --> 01:03:51,934
We need to think of time as a resource,
like oxygen and food. Going down will cost us.

837
01:03:54,311 --> 01:03:55,479
All right, look.

838
01:03:56,772 --> 01:04:00,234
Dr. Mann's data is promising,
but it will take months to get there.

839
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,611
And Edmunds', it's even further.

840
01:04:02,778 --> 01:04:06,949
Miller hasn't sent much, but what she has
is very promising. It's water, it's organics....

841
01:04:07,115 --> 01:04:09,284
- You don't find that every day.
- No, you don't.

842
01:04:09,451 --> 01:04:11,787
And just think about the resources,
including time...

843
01:04:11,954 --> 01:04:14,456
...that would be spent
trying to get back here.

844
01:04:15,582 --> 01:04:17,376
- Romilly...
- Yeah?

845
01:04:17,543 --> 01:04:21,380
...how far off from Miller's planet
do we have to be to stay out of the time shift?

846
01:04:21,547 --> 01:04:23,215
Just back from the cusp.

847
01:04:23,382 --> 01:04:26,343
All right, which is here,
just outside of Miller's planet.

848
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:28,303
- Right.
- Okay.

849
01:04:29,221 --> 01:04:32,015
Here's Gargantua. Here's Miller's planet.

850
01:04:32,182 --> 01:04:35,352
<i>Instead of taking the Endurance into orbit
around Miller's planet...</i>

851
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:38,397
...which would conserve fuel,
but we would lose a lot of time...

852
01:04:38,564 --> 01:04:42,651
...what if we take a wider orbit around
Gargantua, parallel with Miller's planet...

853
01:04:42,818 --> 01:04:45,320
...outside of this time shift, to here?

854
01:04:45,487 --> 01:04:48,282
Then we take the Ranger down,
we get Miller, we get her samples.

855
01:04:48,448 --> 01:04:51,159
We come back, we analyze, we debrief.
We're in, we're out.

856
01:04:51,326 --> 01:04:53,662
We lose a little fuel,
but we save a whole lot of time.

857
01:04:53,829 --> 01:04:55,664
- That'll work.
- That's good.

858
01:04:55,831 --> 01:04:58,292
There's no time for monkey business
or chit-chat down there.

859
01:04:58,458 --> 01:05:01,253
So, TARS, you should definitely stay here.

860
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:03,672
CASE, you're with me. Anyone else can stay.

861
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:07,426
If we're talking about a couple years,
I could use the time to research gravity.

862
01:05:07,593 --> 01:05:10,554
Observations from the wormhole,
that's gold to Professor Brand.

863
01:05:10,721 --> 01:05:12,389
TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua.

864
01:05:12,556 --> 01:05:17,311
Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting,
but make sure we stay in range of Miller's planet.

865
01:05:17,477 --> 01:05:20,022
- You got it?
- I wouldn't leave you behind...

866
01:05:20,188 --> 01:05:21,231
...Dr. Brand.

867
01:05:25,902 --> 01:05:27,529
- You ready, CASE?
- Yup.

868
01:05:28,488 --> 01:05:31,992
- You don't say much, do you?
- TARS talks plenty for both of us.

869
01:05:33,201 --> 01:05:34,244
Detach.

870
01:05:41,543 --> 01:05:44,504
<i>- Romilly, are you reading these forces?
- It's unbelievable.</i>

871
01:05:47,716 --> 01:05:49,843
A literal heart of darkness.

872
01:05:54,014 --> 01:05:56,725
If we could just see
the collapsed star inside...

873
01:05:56,892 --> 01:05:59,645
...the singularity, yeah, we'd solve gravity.

874
01:06:00,062 --> 01:06:03,357
<i>- And we can't get anything from it?
- Nothing escapes that horizon.</i>

875
01:06:03,523 --> 01:06:04,858
Not even light.

876
01:06:05,025 --> 01:06:08,528
<i>- The answer's there, just no way to see it.
- There's Miller's planet.</i>

877
01:06:11,198 --> 01:06:12,532
Goodbye, Ranger.

878
01:06:25,337 --> 01:06:27,631
This is fast for atmospheric entry.

879
01:06:27,798 --> 01:06:30,050
- Should we use the thrusters to slow?
- No.

880
01:06:30,509 --> 01:06:33,845
I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics
to save some fuel.

881
01:06:34,012 --> 01:06:35,222
Air brake?

882
01:06:35,389 --> 01:06:38,934
- We want to get down fast, don't we?
- We want to get there in one piece.

883
01:06:39,101 --> 01:06:42,104
- Hang on.
- Brand, Doyle, get ready.

884
01:06:57,953 --> 01:07:00,455
- We should ease!
- Hands where I can see them.

885
01:07:00,622 --> 01:07:03,959
The only time I went down was
when a machine was easing at the wrong time.

886
01:07:04,126 --> 01:07:06,962
- A little caution--
- Can get you killed, like reckless driving.

887
01:07:07,129 --> 01:07:09,297
- Cooper, it's too damn fast!
- I got this.

888
01:07:14,136 --> 01:07:18,140
- Should I disable the feedback?
- No. I need to feel the air.

889
01:07:22,144 --> 01:07:23,311
Here we go.

890
01:07:26,606 --> 01:07:27,899
It's just water!

891
01:07:29,401 --> 01:07:30,902
The stuff of life.

892
01:07:31,361 --> 01:07:32,779
Twelve hundred meters.

893
01:07:32,946 --> 01:07:34,990
- Do we have a fix on the beacon?
- Got it!

894
01:07:35,157 --> 01:07:37,784
- Can you maneuver?
- I'll need to shave some speed.

895
01:07:37,951 --> 01:07:40,579
I'm gonna spiral down on top of it.
Everybody hang on!

896
01:07:42,998 --> 01:07:44,040
Seven hundred.

897
01:07:46,168 --> 01:07:48,170
On my cue, CASE. On my cue.

898
01:07:51,673 --> 01:07:53,175
Five hundred meters.

899
01:08:02,642 --> 01:08:03,685
Fire!

900
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,325
Very graceful.

901
01:08:18,492 --> 01:08:19,576
No.

902
01:08:20,202 --> 01:08:22,287
But very efficient.

903
01:08:24,748 --> 01:08:26,958
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

904
01:08:27,125 --> 01:08:29,044
Go, go, go!

905
01:08:29,461 --> 01:08:32,714
Seven years per hour here.
Let's make it count!

906
01:08:58,824 --> 01:09:00,075
This way.

907
01:09:02,911 --> 01:09:04,663
About 200 meters.

908
01:09:14,172 --> 01:09:15,799
The gravity's punishing.

909
01:09:16,758 --> 01:09:18,885
Been floating through space too long?

910
01:09:19,052 --> 01:09:21,096
One hundred and thirty percent
Earth gravity.

911
01:09:21,429 --> 01:09:23,431
Come on. Come on.

912
01:09:26,059 --> 01:09:28,895
- There's nothing here.
- Should be right here.

913
01:09:30,814 --> 01:09:33,817
If the signal's coming from here, then....

914
01:09:43,451 --> 01:09:44,619
Her beacon.

915
01:09:52,752 --> 01:09:53,795
Wreckage.

916
01:09:54,462 --> 01:09:55,630
<i>Where's the rest?</i>

917
01:09:56,131 --> 01:09:57,632
Towards the mountains!

918
01:10:01,469 --> 01:10:03,305
Those aren't mountains.

919
01:10:04,973 --> 01:10:06,308
They're waves.

920
01:10:11,646 --> 01:10:14,316
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

921
01:10:14,816 --> 01:10:16,818
<i>That one's moving away from us.</i>

922
01:10:23,325 --> 01:10:24,993
We need the recorder.

923
01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:37,422
Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!

924
01:10:37,589 --> 01:10:40,967
We're not leaving without her data.

925
01:10:41,134 --> 01:10:42,469
Get back here now!

926
01:10:42,636 --> 01:10:44,346
<i>We do not have time!</i>

927
01:10:44,512 --> 01:10:46,973
The second wave is coming!
We're in the middle of a swell.

928
01:10:48,266 --> 01:10:49,684
No, I got it.

929
01:10:49,851 --> 01:10:51,853
Get your ass back to the Ranger now!

930
01:10:56,858 --> 01:10:58,902
Brand, get back here now!

931
01:11:00,862 --> 01:11:03,073
No, Cooper, go. Cooper, go. I can't make it.

932
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:05,867
<i>- Go!
- CASE, go get her.</i>

933
01:11:10,664 --> 01:11:12,666
- Go!
- Get up. Get up, Brand!

934
01:11:13,583 --> 01:11:15,085
Go, go! Go!

935
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:19,506
- I'm not gonna make it!
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are!

936
01:11:26,346 --> 01:11:28,640
Come on, CASE has her!
Get back here, Doyle!

937
01:11:31,643 --> 01:11:32,727
Come on!

938
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:36,898
Get to the hatch!

939
01:11:41,444 --> 01:11:42,946
Go, go! Go!

940
01:11:48,493 --> 01:11:49,577
Shit.

941
01:11:50,078 --> 01:11:51,913
Manually overriding inside hatch!

942
01:11:55,417 --> 01:11:56,584
Cooper! Wait!

943
01:12:03,925 --> 01:12:07,595
The engines are flooded!
I'm gonna have to shut her down.

944
01:12:41,046 --> 01:12:42,380
Holy shit.

945
01:12:46,801 --> 01:12:48,136
Hang on!

946
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:20,627
CASE, what's the problem?

947
01:13:20,794 --> 01:13:23,213
Too waterlogged. Let it drain.

948
01:13:24,339 --> 01:13:25,548
Goddamn it!

949
01:13:25,715 --> 01:13:30,386
- I told you to leave me! Why didn't you?
- And I told you to get your ass back here!

950
01:13:30,553 --> 01:13:35,225
- One of us was thinking about the mission!
- You were thinking about getting home.

951
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:39,395
I was trying to do the right thing!

952
01:13:39,562 --> 01:13:41,523
Can you tell that to Doyle?

953
01:13:43,817 --> 01:13:45,985
- CASE, how much time?
- Forty-five to an hour.

954
01:13:47,779 --> 01:13:49,114
The stuff of life, huh?

955
01:13:50,031 --> 01:13:52,200
What's this gonna cost us, Brand?

956
01:13:52,367 --> 01:13:54,327
A lot. Decades.

957
01:14:01,543 --> 01:14:02,877
What happened to Miller?

958
01:14:03,628 --> 01:14:06,381
Judging by the wreckage, she was...

959
01:14:06,548 --> 01:14:09,175
...broken up by a wave soon after impact.

960
01:14:09,342 --> 01:14:12,178
How's the wreckage stayed together
after all these years, huh?

961
01:14:13,429 --> 01:14:15,431
Because of the time slippage.

962
01:14:16,558 --> 01:14:21,062
On this planet's time,
she just landed hours ago.

963
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:24,357
She probably just died minutes ago.

964
01:14:24,524 --> 01:14:28,570
The data Doyle received
was just the initial status echoing endlessly.

965
01:14:28,945 --> 01:14:31,114
Oh, we are not prepared for this.

966
01:14:33,491 --> 01:14:36,953
You eggheads have the survival skills
of a Boy Scout troop.

967
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:40,373
Well, we got this far on our brains.
Farther than any human in history.

968
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:42,125
Well, not far enough!

969
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:45,962
And now we're stuck here till there won't be
anyone left on Earth to save.

970
01:14:49,007 --> 01:14:51,676
I'm counting every minute,
same as you, Cooper.

971
01:14:56,472 --> 01:14:58,308
Is there any possibility...

972
01:14:58,474 --> 01:15:02,103
...some kind of a way
we can maybe all jump in a black hole?

973
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:03,938
Gain back the years?

974
01:15:04,606 --> 01:15:06,107
Don't shake your head at me.

975
01:15:06,274 --> 01:15:08,276
Time is relative, okay?

976
01:15:08,443 --> 01:15:11,487
It can stretch and it can squeeze, but...

977
01:15:11,988 --> 01:15:14,199
...it can't run backwards. It just can't.

978
01:15:14,365 --> 01:15:18,786
The only thing that can move across
dimensions, like time, is gravity.

979
01:15:21,497 --> 01:15:22,665
Okay.

980
01:15:24,626 --> 01:15:28,504
The beings that led us here,
they communicate...

981
01:15:28,671 --> 01:15:30,506
- ...through gravity, right?
- Yes.

982
01:15:30,673 --> 01:15:32,842
Could they be talking to us from the future?

983
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,012
- Maybe.
- Okay. If they can....

984
01:15:37,222 --> 01:15:40,475
"They" are beings of five dimensions.

985
01:15:40,892 --> 01:15:44,229
To them, time might be
another physical dimension.

986
01:15:44,562 --> 01:15:45,897
To them...

987
01:15:46,314 --> 01:15:50,485
...the past might be a canyon
that they can climb into and the future...

988
01:15:50,652 --> 01:15:53,655
...a mountain they can climb up.
But to us, it's not, okay?

989
01:15:54,739 --> 01:15:57,158
Look, Cooper, I screwed up. I'm sorry.

990
01:15:59,327 --> 01:16:01,079
But you knew about relativity.

991
01:16:01,246 --> 01:16:02,580
Oh.

992
01:16:04,290 --> 01:16:05,458
Brand...

993
01:16:10,338 --> 01:16:12,257
...my daughter was 10 years old.

994
01:16:12,882 --> 01:16:15,677
I couldn't teach her
Einstein's theories before I left.

995
01:16:16,094 --> 01:16:18,930
Couldn't you have told her
you were going to save the world?

996
01:16:19,514 --> 01:16:20,556
No.

997
01:16:22,225 --> 01:16:26,396
When you become a parent,
one thing becomes really clear.

998
01:16:27,897 --> 01:16:31,067
And that is that you want to make sure
your children feel safe.

999
01:16:32,110 --> 01:16:35,863
And it rules out telling a 10-year-old
that the world is ending.

1000
01:16:38,324 --> 01:16:39,701
Cooper?

1001
01:16:43,413 --> 01:16:45,915
- How long for the engines, CASE?
- A minute or two.

1002
01:16:46,082 --> 01:16:48,167
We don't have it. Helmets on!

1003
01:16:52,088 --> 01:16:53,881
Brand, co-pilot, you're up.

1004
01:16:54,048 --> 01:16:56,551
CASE, blow the cabin oxygen
through the main thrusters!

1005
01:16:56,718 --> 01:16:58,428
- We're gonna spark it.
- Roger that.

1006
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,054
- Locked.
- Depressurizing.

1007
01:17:05,935 --> 01:17:07,186
Engines up!

1008
01:17:36,049 --> 01:17:37,550
Hello, Rom.

1009
01:17:38,009 --> 01:17:39,677
I've waited years.

1010
01:17:40,762 --> 01:17:42,597
How--? How many years?

1011
01:17:44,432 --> 01:17:47,393
- By now it must be....
Twenty-three years...

1012
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:49,270
...four months, eight days.

1013
01:17:53,691 --> 01:17:54,859
Doyle?

1014
01:18:01,074 --> 01:18:04,077
I thought I was prepared. I knew the theory.

1015
01:18:05,453 --> 01:18:06,954
Reality's different.

1016
01:18:07,997 --> 01:18:09,165
And Miller?

1017
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:12,752
There's nothing here for us.

1018
01:18:15,505 --> 01:18:17,006
Why didn't you sleep?

1019
01:18:17,965 --> 01:18:22,053
Oh, I had a couple of stretches.
But I stopped believing you were coming back.

1020
01:18:22,553 --> 01:18:25,556
And something seemed wrong
about dreaming my life away.

1021
01:18:26,391 --> 01:18:29,227
I learned what I could from the black hole...

1022
01:18:29,602 --> 01:18:32,063
...but I couldn't send anything to your father.

1023
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:34,482
We've been receiving, but nothing gets out.

1024
01:18:34,649 --> 01:18:36,734
- Is he alive?
- Oh, yeah.

1025
01:18:37,151 --> 01:18:38,945
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1026
01:18:41,948 --> 01:18:44,951
We've got years of messages stored.

1027
01:18:45,243 --> 01:18:46,411
Cooper.

1028
01:18:46,577 --> 01:18:49,580
<i>Messages span 23 years.</i>

1029
01:18:51,624 --> 01:18:53,292
Play it from the beginning.

1030
01:18:56,337 --> 01:18:58,047
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

1031
01:18:58,881 --> 01:19:01,300
<i>Checking in. Saying hi.</i>

1032
01:19:02,385 --> 01:19:03,886
<i>Um....</i>

1033
01:19:04,053 --> 01:19:05,847
<i>Finished second in school.</i>

1034
01:19:07,432 --> 01:19:09,851
<i>Miss Kurling's still giving me C's though.</i>

1035
01:19:10,143 --> 01:19:12,979
<i>Pulled me down, but second's not bad.</i>

1036
01:19:14,147 --> 01:19:16,315
<i>Grandpa attended the ceremony.</i>

1037
01:19:17,942 --> 01:19:19,944
<i>Um-- Oh.</i>

1038
01:19:20,903 --> 01:19:22,864
<i>I met another girl, Dad.</i>

1039
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:24,615
<i>I, uh....</i>

1040
01:19:25,366 --> 01:19:27,368
<i>I really think this is the one.</i>

1041
01:19:28,661 --> 01:19:31,247
<i>Name's Lois. That's her right there.</i>

1042
01:19:34,292 --> 01:19:36,294
<i>Murphy stole Grandpa's car.</i>

1043
01:19:36,961 --> 01:19:39,630
<i>She crashed it. She's okay, though.</i>

1044
01:19:40,298 --> 01:19:41,382
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

1045
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:43,634
<i>Look at this!</i>

1046
01:19:44,469 --> 01:19:45,970
<i>You're a grandpa.</i>

1047
01:19:47,388 --> 01:19:49,056
<i>His name's Jesse.</i>

1048
01:19:49,724 --> 01:19:54,312
<i>I kind of wanted to call him Coop,
but Lois says, uh, maybe next time.</i>

1049
01:19:54,979 --> 01:19:59,400
<i>Donald says he's already earned
the "great" part, so we just leave it at that.</i>

1050
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:04,363
<i>Oh, dear. Oh, dear.</i>

1051
01:20:05,156 --> 01:20:06,782
<i>Say "Bye-bye, Grandpa."</i>

1052
01:20:07,158 --> 01:20:08,993
<i>Bye-bye, Grandpa. Okay.</i>

1053
01:20:09,410 --> 01:20:11,913
<i>Sorry it's been a while.</i>

1054
01:20:13,289 --> 01:20:14,332
<i>Just...</i>

1055
01:20:16,542 --> 01:20:18,544
<i>...what with Jesse and all.</i>

1056
01:20:21,923 --> 01:20:23,424
<i>Uh....</i>

1057
01:20:25,051 --> 01:20:27,386
<i>Grandpa died last week.</i>

1058
01:20:27,803 --> 01:20:30,890
<i>We buried him out in the back forty
next to Mom and...</i>

1059
01:20:31,766 --> 01:20:32,850
<i>... Jesse.</i>

1060
01:20:33,726 --> 01:20:36,812
<i>Which is where we would have buried you
if you'd ever...</i>

1061
01:20:37,563 --> 01:20:39,065
<i>...come back.</i>

1062
01:20:40,566 --> 01:20:42,818
<i>Murph was there at the funeral.</i>

1063
01:20:43,444 --> 01:20:46,197
<i>We don't see her that much,
but she came for that.</i>

1064
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:51,827
<i>You aren't listening to this, I know that.</i>

1065
01:20:54,956 --> 01:20:57,708
<i>All these messages are just, like...</i>

1066
01:20:58,876 --> 01:21:02,547
<i>...drifting out there in the darkness.</i>

1067
01:21:03,631 --> 01:21:05,967
<i>Lois says that, uh...</i>

1068
01:21:06,759 --> 01:21:09,512
<i>...I have to let you go.</i>

1069
01:21:09,887 --> 01:21:11,722
<i>And, uh...</i>

1070
01:21:12,223 --> 01:21:13,307
<i>...so...</i>

1071
01:21:16,561 --> 01:21:19,647
<i>...I guess I'm letting you go.</i>

1072
01:21:20,606 --> 01:21:23,276
<i>I don't know where you are, Dad...</i>

1073
01:21:23,901 --> 01:21:26,529
<i>...but I hope that you're at peace.</i>

1074
01:21:28,322 --> 01:21:29,407
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1075
01:21:43,004 --> 01:21:44,255
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

1076
01:21:47,091 --> 01:21:48,259
Hey, Murph.

1077
01:21:48,426 --> 01:21:50,344
<i>You son of a bitch.</i>

1078
01:21:54,056 --> 01:21:56,559
<i>I never made one of these
when you were still responding...</i>

1079
01:21:56,726 --> 01:21:59,061
<i>...because I was so mad at you for leaving.</i>

1080
01:22:02,106 --> 01:22:04,191
<i>And then when you went quiet, it...</i>

1081
01:22:06,819 --> 01:22:09,655
<i>...seemed like I should live with that decision.
And I have.</i>

1082
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,579
<i>But today's my birthday.</i>

1083
01:22:20,249 --> 01:22:23,419
<i>And it's a special one,
because you told me....</i>

1084
01:22:27,548 --> 01:22:31,886
<i>You once told me that when you came back,
we might be the same age.</i>

1085
01:22:33,596 --> 01:22:36,682
<i>And today I'm the age you were
when you left.</i>

1086
01:22:39,685 --> 01:22:41,771
<i>So it would be a real good time
for you to come back.</i>

1087
01:22:56,243 --> 01:23:00,539
I didn't mean to intrude. It's just that
I've never seen you in here before.

1088
01:23:01,165 --> 01:23:03,334
I've never been in here before.

1089
01:23:05,211 --> 01:23:08,214
I talk to Amelia all the time.

1090
01:23:08,714 --> 01:23:10,049
It helps.

1091
01:23:10,716 --> 01:23:13,469
- I'm glad you've started.
- I haven't. I--

1092
01:23:13,636 --> 01:23:16,138
I just had something I needed to get out.

1093
01:23:16,472 --> 01:23:18,891
- I know they're still out there.
- I know.

1094
01:23:19,058 --> 01:23:23,270
There are so many reasons their
communications might not be getting through.

1095
01:23:23,437 --> 01:23:24,855
I know, professor.

1096
01:23:25,481 --> 01:23:28,401
I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of.

1097
01:23:29,568 --> 01:23:31,904
Them never coming back or...

1098
01:23:33,114 --> 01:23:36,325
...coming back to find we've failed.

1099
01:23:36,492 --> 01:23:37,910
Then let's succeed.

1100
01:23:38,953 --> 01:23:39,995
So...

1101
01:23:40,705 --> 01:23:44,709
...back to the fourth iteration.
Let's run it through some new fields.

1102
01:23:45,042 --> 01:23:48,212
With respect, professor,
we've tried that hundreds of times.

1103
01:23:48,546 --> 01:23:52,216
It only has to work once, Murph.

1104
01:23:55,511 --> 01:23:59,390
Every rivet that they strike
could have been a bullet.

1105
01:23:59,557 --> 01:24:01,559
We've done well for the world here...

1106
01:24:01,726 --> 01:24:06,480
...whether or not we crack the equation
before I kick the bucket.

1107
01:24:06,647 --> 01:24:09,525
- Don't be morbid, professor.
- I'm not afraid of death.

1108
01:24:10,276 --> 01:24:12,111
I'm an old physicist.

1109
01:24:13,362 --> 01:24:15,030
I'm afraid of time.

1110
01:24:22,204 --> 01:24:23,372
Time.

1111
01:24:25,416 --> 01:24:27,084
You're afraid of time.

1112
01:24:29,670 --> 01:24:31,672
We've been trying to solve the equation...

1113
01:24:31,839 --> 01:24:34,341
...without changing
the underlying assumption about time.

1114
01:24:34,508 --> 01:24:36,218
- And?
- And that means...

1115
01:24:36,385 --> 01:24:40,848
...each iteration is an attempt
to prove its own proof.

1116
01:24:41,015 --> 01:24:43,142
It's recursive. It's nonsensical.

1117
01:24:43,434 --> 01:24:45,352
Are you calling my life's work...

1118
01:24:45,519 --> 01:24:47,229
...nonsense, Murph?

1119
01:24:47,396 --> 01:24:49,440
No, I'm saying that you've been trying to...

1120
01:24:49,607 --> 01:24:53,402
...finish it with one arm-- No, with both arms.
--tied behind your back.

1121
01:24:55,488 --> 01:24:57,490
And I don't understand why.

1122
01:24:58,449 --> 01:25:00,284
I'm an old man, Murph.

1123
01:25:01,202 --> 01:25:03,829
Can we take this point up at another time?

1124
01:25:03,996 --> 01:25:06,123
I want to talk to my daughter.

1125
01:25:08,292 --> 01:25:10,753
<i>Stepping out into the universe...</i>

1126
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:14,715
<i>...we must confront the reality
of interstellar travel.</i>

1127
01:25:15,633 --> 01:25:20,179
<i>We must reach far beyond
our own lifespans.</i>

1128
01:25:20,346 --> 01:25:25,476
<i>We must think not as individuals
but as a species.</i>

1129
01:25:28,312 --> 01:25:30,940
<i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>

1130
01:25:33,108 --> 01:25:35,694
<i>TARS kept the Endurance
right where we needed her.</i>

1131
01:25:35,861 --> 01:25:38,656
But the trip took years longer
than we anticipated.

1132
01:25:38,989 --> 01:25:42,493
We no longer have the fuel
to visit both prospects, so...

1133
01:25:42,827 --> 01:25:44,328
...we have to choose.

1134
01:25:45,538 --> 01:25:46,664
But how?

1135
01:25:47,706 --> 01:25:49,375
They're both promising.

1136
01:25:50,918 --> 01:25:55,422
Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann
is the one still transmitting, so....

1137
01:25:55,589 --> 01:25:58,509
We've no reason to suspect
Edmunds's data would have soured.

1138
01:25:59,426 --> 01:26:01,929
His world has key elements
to sustain human life.

1139
01:26:02,096 --> 01:26:05,266
- As does Dr. Mann's.
- Cooper, this is my field.

1140
01:26:06,433 --> 01:26:07,476
And...

1141
01:26:08,269 --> 01:26:10,437
...I really believe Edmunds'
is the better prospect.

1142
01:26:10,604 --> 01:26:13,941
- Why?
- Gargantua, that's why.

1143
01:26:15,067 --> 01:26:19,113
Look at Miller's planet.
Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...

1144
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:23,701
...but no life. Sterile.
We'll find the same thing on Mann's.

1145
01:26:24,118 --> 01:26:25,786
Because of the black hole?

1146
01:26:26,078 --> 01:26:29,123
Murphy's Law.
Whatever can happen will happen.

1147
01:26:29,290 --> 01:26:31,625
Accident is the first building block
of evolution.

1148
01:26:31,792 --> 01:26:34,628
But when you're orbiting a black hole
not enough can happen.

1149
01:26:34,795 --> 01:26:39,091
It sucks in asteroids and comets,
other events which would otherwise reach you.

1150
01:26:39,466 --> 01:26:41,302
We need to go further afield.

1151
01:26:41,927 --> 01:26:44,263
You once said that Dr. Mann...

1152
01:26:45,514 --> 01:26:47,016
...was the best of us.

1153
01:26:47,308 --> 01:26:50,477
He's remarkable.
We're only here because of him.

1154
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:52,855
And yet-- Yet here he is.

1155
01:26:53,022 --> 01:26:57,985
He's on the ground, and he's sending
a very unambiguous message, telling us...

1156
01:26:58,152 --> 01:26:59,862
...to come to his planet.

1157
01:27:00,029 --> 01:27:04,658
Granted, but Edmunds' data
is more promising.

1158
01:27:05,117 --> 01:27:06,160
We should vote.

1159
01:27:06,327 --> 01:27:08,495
Well, if we vote,
there's something you should know.

1160
01:27:09,622 --> 01:27:10,664
Brand?

1161
01:27:10,831 --> 01:27:12,499
He has a right to know.

1162
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,752
That has nothing to do with it.

1163
01:27:14,919 --> 01:27:17,963
- What does?
- She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.

1164
01:27:18,130 --> 01:27:20,674
- Is that true?
- Yes.

1165
01:27:23,844 --> 01:27:26,555
And that makes me want to follow my heart.

1166
01:27:30,017 --> 01:27:33,687
But maybe we've spent too long
trying to figure all this out with theory.

1167
01:27:33,854 --> 01:27:35,272
You're a scientist, Brand.

1168
01:27:35,439 --> 01:27:36,982
So listen to me...

1169
01:27:37,816 --> 01:27:42,529
...when I say that love
isn't something we invented. It's...

1170
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:45,866
...observable, powerful.

1171
01:27:47,952 --> 01:27:49,662
It has to mean something.

1172
01:27:49,828 --> 01:27:54,208
Love has meaning, yes.
Social utility, social bonding, child rearing....

1173
01:27:54,375 --> 01:27:57,878
We love people who have died.
Where's the social utility in that?

1174
01:27:58,420 --> 01:27:59,463
None.

1175
01:27:59,630 --> 01:28:03,509
Maybe it means something more,
something we can't...

1176
01:28:03,676 --> 01:28:05,719
...yet understand.

1177
01:28:05,886 --> 01:28:09,348
Maybe it's some evidence, some...

1178
01:28:10,307 --> 01:28:14,770
...artifact of a higher dimension
that we can't consciously perceive.

1179
01:28:14,937 --> 01:28:19,733
I'm drawn across the universe
to someone I haven't seen in a decade...

1180
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:22,736
...who I know is probably dead.

1181
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:26,407
Love is the one thing
we're capable of perceiving...

1182
01:28:26,573 --> 01:28:29,410
...that transcends dimensions
of time and space.

1183
01:28:31,245 --> 01:28:35,582
Maybe we should trust that,
even if we can't understand it yet.

1184
01:28:40,587 --> 01:28:42,256
All right, Cooper...

1185
01:28:44,133 --> 01:28:45,426
...yes...

1186
01:28:46,593 --> 01:28:49,930
...the tiniest possibility
of seeing Wolf again excites me.

1187
01:28:50,764 --> 01:28:52,433
That doesn't mean I'm wrong.

1188
01:28:53,142 --> 01:28:55,310
Honestly, Amelia...

1189
01:28:57,104 --> 01:28:58,272
...it might.

1190
01:29:05,070 --> 01:29:07,781
TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's.

1191
01:29:24,673 --> 01:29:26,133
We'll lose about a third again.

1192
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:27,843
But next year....

1193
01:29:30,137 --> 01:29:32,973
Next year I'm gonna work Nelson's farm
and we'll make it up.

1194
01:29:33,807 --> 01:29:35,642
What happened to Nelson?

1195
01:29:41,565 --> 01:29:43,776
<i>Murph, would you like some more soufflé?</i>

1196
01:29:43,942 --> 01:29:47,321
Oh, no. I'm full, thanks. It was delicious.

1197
01:29:48,197 --> 01:29:50,199
Coop, finish your fritter, please.

1198
01:29:52,367 --> 01:29:56,080
Will you spend the night?
Your room is exactly as you left it. It's ready.

1199
01:29:56,246 --> 01:29:57,623
I need to get back.

1200
01:29:57,790 --> 01:30:00,334
My sewing machine is in there,
but there's plenty--

1201
01:30:00,501 --> 01:30:01,794
I need to....

1202
01:30:04,671 --> 01:30:06,215
Too many memories.

1203
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:09,635
We might have something for that.
Hey, Coop.

1204
01:30:17,184 --> 01:30:18,477
The dust.

1205
01:30:20,979 --> 01:30:23,357
Lois, I have a friend who...

1206
01:30:23,524 --> 01:30:25,359
...could look at his lungs.

1207
01:30:43,544 --> 01:30:46,213
- Amelia, I'm sorry.
- You were just being objective.

1208
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:49,842
Unless you're punishing me
for screwing up on Miller's planet.

1209
01:30:50,008 --> 01:30:52,261
No, this wasn't a personal decision.

1210
01:30:53,095 --> 01:30:57,141
If you're wrong, you will have
a very personal decision to make.

1211
01:30:57,307 --> 01:31:00,269
Your fuel calculations
are based on a return journey.

1212
01:31:00,602 --> 01:31:04,481
Strike out on Mann's planet, and we'll have
to decide whether to return home...

1213
01:31:04,773 --> 01:31:06,900
...or push on to Edmunds' with Plan B.

1214
01:31:07,234 --> 01:31:10,904
Starting a colony could save us
from extinction.

1215
01:31:11,238 --> 01:31:14,408
You might have to decide
between seeing your children again...

1216
01:31:14,575 --> 01:31:16,410
...and the future of the human race.

1217
01:31:17,911 --> 01:31:19,621
I trust you'll be as objective then.

1218
01:31:26,503 --> 01:31:28,422
He's been asking for you since he came to.

1219
01:31:28,589 --> 01:31:30,215
We were trying to reach you.

1220
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:37,222
Murph.

1221
01:31:38,223 --> 01:31:39,725
I'm here, professor.

1222
01:31:40,434 --> 01:31:42,769
I let you all down.

1223
01:31:43,103 --> 01:31:46,440
No, you got us so far. Real close.

1224
01:31:48,275 --> 01:31:50,068
I'll finish what you started.

1225
01:31:50,235 --> 01:31:52,446
Good, good Murph.

1226
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:57,034
You had faith...

1227
01:31:58,243 --> 01:31:59,536
...all those...

1228
01:32:00,495 --> 01:32:02,289
...all those years.

1229
01:32:03,957 --> 01:32:05,209
I...

1230
01:32:05,375 --> 01:32:07,878
I asked you to have faith.

1231
01:32:09,630 --> 01:32:12,424
I wanted you to believe...

1232
01:32:13,926 --> 01:32:15,802
...that your father...

1233
01:32:18,805 --> 01:32:20,641
...would come back.

1234
01:32:20,807 --> 01:32:22,100
I do, professor.

1235
01:32:23,727 --> 01:32:25,229
Forgive me, Murph.

1236
01:32:25,979 --> 01:32:27,981
There's nothing to forgive.

1237
01:32:30,651 --> 01:32:31,693
I....

1238
01:32:32,277 --> 01:32:34,112
I lied, Murph.

1239
01:32:36,490 --> 01:32:38,283
I lied to you.

1240
01:32:44,623 --> 01:32:47,834
There was no need for him to....

1241
01:32:49,044 --> 01:32:50,921
To come back.

1242
01:32:53,507 --> 01:32:56,843
There is no way to help us.

1243
01:32:58,136 --> 01:32:59,179
But Plan A....

1244
01:32:59,721 --> 01:33:02,849
All this. All these people.

1245
01:33:03,976 --> 01:33:05,769
And the equation.

1246
01:33:09,773 --> 01:33:11,525
Did my father know?

1247
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:17,030
Did he leave me?

1248
01:33:20,993 --> 01:33:22,035
Do...

1249
01:33:23,203 --> 01:33:24,538
...not...

1250
01:33:25,497 --> 01:33:26,748
...go...

1251
01:33:27,958 --> 01:33:29,543
...gentle....

1252
01:33:31,545 --> 01:33:32,713
No.

1253
01:33:34,381 --> 01:33:35,465
No!

1254
01:33:36,675 --> 01:33:38,343
You can't leave.

1255
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:39,970
You-- No.

1256
01:33:41,054 --> 01:33:45,726
<i>Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today. He had no pain.</i>

1257
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:47,978
He was at peace.

1258
01:33:48,645 --> 01:33:50,731
I'm very sorry for your loss.

1259
01:34:03,327 --> 01:34:04,995
Brand, did you know?

1260
01:34:07,414 --> 01:34:09,082
<i>He told you, right?</i>

1261
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:13,337
<i>You knew.</i>

1262
01:34:15,255 --> 01:34:17,049
<i>This was all a sham.</i>

1263
01:34:21,428 --> 01:34:23,513
<i>You left us here.</i>

1264
01:34:25,265 --> 01:34:26,767
<i>To suffocate.</i>

1265
01:34:28,935 --> 01:34:30,270
<i>To starve.</i>

1266
01:34:57,631 --> 01:34:58,965
Frozen cloud.

1267
01:37:23,401 --> 01:37:24,778
It's okay.

1268
01:37:24,945 --> 01:37:26,363
It's okay.

1269
01:37:33,203 --> 01:37:34,704
It's okay.

1270
01:37:40,126 --> 01:37:42,128
Pray you never learn...

1271
01:37:43,296 --> 01:37:46,633
...just how good it can be
to see another face.

1272
01:37:55,058 --> 01:37:57,561
I hadn't a lot of hope to begin with, but...

1273
01:37:57,727 --> 01:38:00,063
...after so long, I had none.

1274
01:38:01,731 --> 01:38:04,568
My supplies were completely exhausted.

1275
01:38:06,528 --> 01:38:10,282
The last time I went to sleep,
I didn't even set a waking date.

1276
01:38:13,994 --> 01:38:16,580
You have literally raised me from the dead.

1277
01:38:17,622 --> 01:38:19,791
- Lazarus.
- Hm.

1278
01:38:20,709 --> 01:38:23,962
- What about the others?
- I'm afraid you're it, sir.

1279
01:38:24,671 --> 01:38:27,090
So far, surely.

1280
01:38:27,841 --> 01:38:32,679
No, our present situation is that there's
very little chance of rescuing any others.

1281
01:38:36,433 --> 01:38:38,643
Dr. Mann. Dr. Mann?

1282
01:38:39,519 --> 01:38:41,313
Tell us about your world.

1283
01:38:44,691 --> 01:38:46,568
Our world, we hope.

1284
01:38:50,363 --> 01:38:52,699
Our world, uh, is cold...

1285
01:38:52,866 --> 01:38:54,159
...stark...

1286
01:38:56,036 --> 01:38:57,871
...but undeniably beautiful.

1287
01:39:00,123 --> 01:39:03,376
<i>The days are 67 hours long, cold.</i>

1288
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:09,132
<i>The nights are...</i>

1289
01:39:09,299 --> 01:39:11,635
<i>... 67 far colder hours.</i>

1290
01:39:17,474 --> 01:39:21,811
<i>The gravity is a very, very pleasant
80 percent of the Earth's.</i>

1291
01:39:21,978 --> 01:39:24,981
Now, up here where I landed,
the water is alkali...

1292
01:39:25,315 --> 01:39:29,069
...and the air has too much ammonia to breathe
for more than just a few minutes...

1293
01:39:29,235 --> 01:39:33,823
...but down at the surface,
and there is a surface...

1294
01:39:33,990 --> 01:39:35,617
...the chlorine dissipates.

1295
01:39:35,784 --> 01:39:39,663
The ammonia gives way to crystalline
hydrocarbons and breathable air.

1296
01:39:39,996 --> 01:39:41,498
To organics.

1297
01:39:41,831 --> 01:39:44,167
Possibly even to life.

1298
01:39:45,001 --> 01:39:46,920
We might be sharing this world.

1299
01:39:47,462 --> 01:39:49,422
These readings are from the surface?

1300
01:39:49,589 --> 01:39:52,759
Over the years, I've dropped various probes.

1301
01:39:53,093 --> 01:39:56,513
- How far have you explored?
- I've mounted several major expeditions.

1302
01:39:56,680 --> 01:40:00,934
But with oxygen in limited supply,
KIPP there really did most of the legwork.

1303
01:40:01,101 --> 01:40:03,561
- What went wrong with him, sir?
- Degeneration.

1304
01:40:03,728 --> 01:40:07,315
He misidentified the first organics
we found as ammonia crystals.

1305
01:40:07,482 --> 01:40:11,611
We struggled on for a time,
but ultimately I decommissioned him and...

1306
01:40:11,778 --> 01:40:13,947
...used his power source
to keep the mission going.

1307
01:40:14,114 --> 01:40:17,117
I thought I was alone
before I shut him down.

1308
01:40:17,283 --> 01:40:18,952
Would you like me to look at him?

1309
01:40:19,452 --> 01:40:21,621
No. No. He needs a human touch.

1310
01:40:21,788 --> 01:40:26,292
Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message
for you from the comm station.

1311
01:40:26,459 --> 01:40:28,920
Okay. Be right there. Excuse me.

1312
01:40:40,932 --> 01:40:43,518
<i>Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.</i>

1313
01:40:44,227 --> 01:40:45,854
<i>He had no pain.</i>

1314
01:40:48,982 --> 01:40:50,483
<i>He was at peace.</i>

1315
01:40:52,569 --> 01:40:54,404
<i>I'm sorry for your loss.</i>

1316
01:40:56,781 --> 01:40:57,824
Is that Murph?

1317
01:40:58,533 --> 01:41:00,994
She's.... She's grown.

1318
01:41:01,161 --> 01:41:02,746
<i>Brand, did you know?</i>

1319
01:41:03,913 --> 01:41:05,582
<i>He told you, right?</i>

1320
01:41:08,626 --> 01:41:09,919
<i>You knew.</i>

1321
01:41:11,671 --> 01:41:13,173
<i>This was all a sham.</i>

1322
01:41:14,215 --> 01:41:15,884
<i>You left us here.</i>

1323
01:41:18,011 --> 01:41:19,512
<i>To suffocate.</i>

1324
01:41:21,598 --> 01:41:22,974
<i>To starve.</i>

1325
01:41:26,311 --> 01:41:27,896
<i>Did my father know too?</i>

1326
01:41:30,482 --> 01:41:31,941
<i>Dad?</i>

1327
01:41:33,693 --> 01:41:35,612
<i>I just want to know...</i>

1328
01:41:36,946 --> 01:41:38,948
<i>...if you left me here to die.</i>

1329
01:41:41,534 --> 01:41:43,536
<i>I just have to know.</i>

1330
01:41:49,042 --> 01:41:50,460
Cooper, my....

1331
01:41:51,961 --> 01:41:53,880
My father dedicated...

1332
01:41:54,255 --> 01:41:59,260
...his whole life to Plan A.
I have no idea what she's talking about.

1333
01:42:00,970 --> 01:42:02,138
I do.

1334
01:42:07,268 --> 01:42:09,938
He never even hoped
to get the people off the Earth?

1335
01:42:11,147 --> 01:42:12,357
No.

1336
01:42:16,402 --> 01:42:20,240
But he's been trying to solve
the gravity equation for 40 years.

1337
01:42:20,740 --> 01:42:24,160
Amelia, your father solved his equation
before I even left.

1338
01:42:24,744 --> 01:42:26,621
Then why wouldn't he use it?

1339
01:42:26,788 --> 01:42:30,750
The equation couldn't reconcile relativity
with quantum mechanics. You need more.

1340
01:42:30,917 --> 01:42:32,836
More? More what?

1341
01:42:33,002 --> 01:42:36,005
More data. You need to see into a black hole.

1342
01:42:36,172 --> 01:42:38,258
The laws of nature prohibit
a naked singularity.

1343
01:42:38,424 --> 01:42:39,926
Romilly, is that true?

1344
01:42:41,219 --> 01:42:44,931
If a black hole is an oyster,
then the singularity's the pearl inside.

1345
01:42:45,098 --> 01:42:47,851
The gravity's so strong,
it's always hidden in darkness...

1346
01:42:48,017 --> 01:42:49,435
...behind the horizon.

1347
01:42:50,854 --> 01:42:52,939
That's why we call it a black hole.

1348
01:42:53,106 --> 01:42:56,526
Okay, but if we see beyond the horizon....

1349
01:42:57,110 --> 01:42:58,611
We can't, Coop.

1350
01:42:58,778 --> 01:43:01,281
There are some things
that aren't meant to be known.

1351
01:43:01,614 --> 01:43:05,660
Your father had to find another way
to save the human race from extinction.

1352
01:43:05,827 --> 01:43:07,328
Plan B. A colony.

1353
01:43:07,495 --> 01:43:09,163
Why not tell people?

1354
01:43:10,748 --> 01:43:13,835
- Why keep building those stations?
- He knew how hard it would be...

1355
01:43:14,002 --> 01:43:18,131
...to get people to work together
to save the species instead of themselves.

1356
01:43:18,298 --> 01:43:19,465
Or their children.

1357
01:43:19,632 --> 01:43:20,675
Bullshit.

1358
01:43:20,842 --> 01:43:23,636
You never would've come
unless you believed you would save them.

1359
01:43:23,803 --> 01:43:27,015
Evolution has yet to transcend
that simple barrier.

1360
01:43:27,181 --> 01:43:29,642
We can care deeply, selflessly about...

1361
01:43:29,809 --> 01:43:33,313
...those we know, but that empathy
rarely extends beyond our line of sight.

1362
01:43:33,479 --> 01:43:35,189
But the lie.

1363
01:43:38,484 --> 01:43:40,904
That monstrous lie?

1364
01:43:42,155 --> 01:43:43,448
Unforgivable.

1365
01:43:43,615 --> 01:43:45,074
And he knew that.

1366
01:43:45,825 --> 01:43:50,163
He was prepared to destroy his own humanity
in order to save the species.

1367
01:43:50,330 --> 01:43:52,749
- He made an incredible sacrifice.
- No.

1368
01:43:54,167 --> 01:43:59,047
An incredible sacrifice is being made
by the people on Earth who are gonna die!

1369
01:43:59,505 --> 01:44:01,674
Because in his fucking arrogance...

1370
01:44:02,091 --> 01:44:04,177
...he declared their case hopeless.

1371
01:44:04,844 --> 01:44:06,346
I'm sorry, Cooper...

1372
01:44:06,888 --> 01:44:08,348
...their case is hopeless.

1373
01:44:08,514 --> 01:44:10,642
No. No.

1374
01:44:11,267 --> 01:44:12,769
We are the future.

1375
01:44:16,439 --> 01:44:18,358
Cooper, what can I do?

1376
01:44:21,569 --> 01:44:23,404
Let me go home.

1377
01:44:23,988 --> 01:44:25,907
You're absolutely positive?

1378
01:44:26,532 --> 01:44:29,035
His solution was correct.
He'd had it for years.

1379
01:44:29,702 --> 01:44:32,330
- It's worthless?
- It's half the answer.

1380
01:44:33,289 --> 01:44:36,292
Okay, how do you find the other half?

1381
01:44:36,876 --> 01:44:38,544
Out there? A black hole.

1382
01:44:38,711 --> 01:44:41,547
- But stuck down here on Earth?
- Yeah?

1383
01:44:42,882 --> 01:44:44,550
I'm not sure you can.

1384
01:44:46,469 --> 01:44:49,138
God, they just pack up and leave.

1385
01:44:50,556 --> 01:44:52,642
What are they hoping to find?

1386
01:44:53,226 --> 01:44:54,268
Survival.

1387
01:45:02,068 --> 01:45:03,152
Damn it.

1388
01:45:06,072 --> 01:45:09,867
Murph, don't--?
Don't people have a right to know?

1389
01:45:10,493 --> 01:45:14,580
Panic won't help.
We just have to keep working, same as ever.

1390
01:45:14,747 --> 01:45:18,084
But isn't that exactly what Professor Brand
was manipulating us to do?

1391
01:45:18,251 --> 01:45:21,504
Brand gave up on us.
I'm still trying to solve this.

1392
01:45:22,130 --> 01:45:23,214
So...

1393
01:45:24,632 --> 01:45:26,300
...do you have an idea?

1394
01:45:27,010 --> 01:45:28,344
A feeling.

1395
01:45:31,764 --> 01:45:33,766
<i>I told you about my ghost.</i>

1396
01:45:35,768 --> 01:45:37,812
<i>My dad thought I called it a ghost...</i>

1397
01:45:38,271 --> 01:45:39,939
...because I was scared of it.

1398
01:45:43,401 --> 01:45:44,736
But I was never scared of it.

1399
01:45:46,946 --> 01:45:49,615
<i>I called it a ghost because it felt....</i>

1400
01:45:52,035 --> 01:45:53,703
It felt like a person.

1401
01:45:56,247 --> 01:45:57,915
It was trying to tell me something.

1402
01:46:00,877 --> 01:46:03,880
If there's an answer here on Earth,
it's back there...

1403
01:46:04,338 --> 01:46:06,257
...somehow, in that room.

1404
01:46:06,799 --> 01:46:08,551
So I have to find it.

1405
01:46:11,971 --> 01:46:13,723
We're running out of time.

1406
01:46:15,641 --> 01:46:17,643
<i>What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?</i>

1407
01:46:17,810 --> 01:46:19,979
No, they can stay.
I'll be sleeping anyway.

1408
01:46:20,146 --> 01:46:21,731
- Hey, Coop?
- Yeah?

1409
01:46:21,898 --> 01:46:23,900
I have a suggestion for your return journey.

1410
01:46:24,067 --> 01:46:26,819
- Yeah, what's that?
- Have one last crack at the black hole.

1411
01:46:28,696 --> 01:46:30,281
I'm going home, Rom.

1412
01:46:30,448 --> 01:46:33,701
Yeah, I know.
This isn't going to cost you any time.

1413
01:46:34,452 --> 01:46:36,287
There's a chance for the people on Earth.

1414
01:46:37,038 --> 01:46:40,083
- Talk to me.
- Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.

1415
01:46:40,249 --> 01:46:44,128
- It's what we call a gentle singularity.
- Gentle?

1416
01:46:44,295 --> 01:46:47,757
They're hardly gentle.
But the tidal gravity is so quick that...

1417
01:46:47,924 --> 01:46:52,178
...something crossing the horizon fast
might survive. A probe, say.

1418
01:46:52,345 --> 01:46:57,016
- What happens after it crosses?
- After the horizon is a complete mystery.

1419
01:46:57,183 --> 01:47:00,269
So, what's to say
there isn't some way that the probe...

1420
01:47:00,436 --> 01:47:03,356
...can glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

1421
01:47:03,523 --> 01:47:06,776
If he's equipped to transmit
every form of energy that can pulse.

1422
01:47:06,943 --> 01:47:09,737
Just when did this probe
become a "he," professor?

1423
01:47:10,279 --> 01:47:12,031
TARS is the obvious candidate.

1424
01:47:12,865 --> 01:47:14,784
I've already told him what to look for.

1425
01:47:14,951 --> 01:47:17,662
I'd need the old optical transmitter
off KIPP, Cooper.

1426
01:47:17,829 --> 01:47:19,163
You'd do this for us?

1427
01:47:19,330 --> 01:47:23,251
Before you get all teary, remember that
as a robot I have to do anything you say.

1428
01:47:24,168 --> 01:47:25,628
Your cue light's broken.

1429
01:47:25,795 --> 01:47:27,338
I'm not joking.

1430
01:47:29,966 --> 01:47:33,219
I'll need TARS to remove and adapt
some components from KIPP.

1431
01:47:33,386 --> 01:47:35,721
I don't want to disturb his archival functions.

1432
01:47:35,888 --> 01:47:37,390
I'll supervise.

1433
01:47:37,723 --> 01:47:38,766
All right.

1434
01:47:38,933 --> 01:47:43,604
Dr. Mann, we need to find three secure sites.
One for Brand's lab, two for habitat.

1435
01:47:43,771 --> 01:47:46,232
Once those modules have landed,
you don't want to move them.

1436
01:47:46,399 --> 01:47:48,943
I can take you to the probe sites,
but I don't think...

1437
01:47:49,110 --> 01:47:51,821
...these conditions will hold.
I think we should wait.

1438
01:47:51,988 --> 01:47:54,824
CASE is headed down
with the rest of the distillery equipment.

1439
01:47:54,991 --> 01:47:57,827
I'd really like to secure those sites by nightfall.

1440
01:47:59,745 --> 01:48:02,832
Well, these squalls do usually blow over.

1441
01:48:03,249 --> 01:48:04,375
Okay, then.

1442
01:48:04,542 --> 01:48:06,752
- You'll need a long-range transmitter.
- Got it.

1443
01:48:06,919 --> 01:48:08,462
- Are you charged?
- Yeah.

1444
01:48:09,046 --> 01:48:10,089
Follow me.

1445
01:48:10,882 --> 01:48:13,050
TARS, 72 hours, yeah?

1446
01:48:13,217 --> 01:48:14,427
Roger that, Cooper.

1447
01:48:20,725 --> 01:48:23,769
Brand told me why you feel
you have to go back.

1448
01:48:25,605 --> 01:48:28,357
But I'd be remiss
if I didn't at least mention...

1449
01:48:28,691 --> 01:48:32,862
...that a mission such as ours
could certainly use an extra engineer.

1450
01:48:34,697 --> 01:48:38,951
You better slow down, turbo.
Safety first, CASE, remember.

1451
01:48:39,577 --> 01:48:41,329
<i>Safety first, Cooper.</i>

1452
01:48:42,580 --> 01:48:45,583
I have to tell you, Dr. Mann,
I'm honored to be a part of this.

1453
01:48:45,958 --> 01:48:50,963
But once we set up base camp and secure
those modules, my work's done here.

1454
01:48:51,380 --> 01:48:52,715
I'm going home.

1455
01:49:00,723 --> 01:49:04,227
You have attachments.
But even without a family...

1456
01:49:04,644 --> 01:49:09,106
...I can promise you that that yearning
to be with other people is powerful.

1457
01:49:09,774 --> 01:49:13,110
That emotion is at the foundation...

1458
01:49:13,778 --> 01:49:16,822
...of what makes us human.
It's not to be taken lightly.

1459
01:49:24,830 --> 01:49:27,416
- How long have you had that cough?
- A while.

1460
01:49:37,969 --> 01:49:39,887
Mom lets me play in here.

1461
01:49:41,806 --> 01:49:43,057
I don't touch your stuff.

1462
01:50:14,046 --> 01:50:15,673
Just take this gently.

1463
01:50:20,803 --> 01:50:24,181
You know why we couldn't just send machines
on these missions, don't you?

1464
01:50:24,807 --> 01:50:29,437
A machine doesn't improvise well
because you can't program a fear of death.

1465
01:50:30,313 --> 01:50:32,648
Our survival instinct is our single greatest...

1466
01:50:32,815 --> 01:50:36,360
...source of inspiration.
Take you, for example.

1467
01:50:37,069 --> 01:50:38,404
A father...

1468
01:50:38,904 --> 01:50:41,907
...with a survival instinct
that extends to your kids.

1469
01:50:43,075 --> 01:50:47,747
What does research tell us is the last thing
you're going to see before you die?

1470
01:50:49,457 --> 01:50:51,917
Your children. Their faces.

1471
01:50:52,251 --> 01:50:54,837
At the moment of death,
your mind's gonna push...

1472
01:50:55,004 --> 01:50:56,714
...a little bit harder to survive.

1473
01:50:57,423 --> 01:50:58,466
For them.

1474
01:50:59,342 --> 01:51:00,593
Deep breath.

1475
01:51:02,887 --> 01:51:06,640
Uh, hey. I bet you're Coop.
Why don't you have a seat here for me?

1476
01:51:06,932 --> 01:51:09,268
It's bad. They cannot stay here.

1477
01:51:09,977 --> 01:51:11,270
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1478
01:51:19,612 --> 01:51:21,072
TARS, what's taking so long?

1479
01:51:21,238 --> 01:51:24,116
Professor, I am having trouble
completing the boot up.

1480
01:51:24,283 --> 01:51:25,826
I don't understand.

1481
01:51:32,625 --> 01:51:33,876
It's funny.

1482
01:51:35,961 --> 01:51:37,588
When I left Earth...

1483
01:51:38,589 --> 01:51:40,674
...I thought I was prepared to die.

1484
01:51:42,718 --> 01:51:44,053
The truth is...

1485
01:51:46,263 --> 01:51:51,268
...I never really considered the possibility
that my planet wasn't the one.

1486
01:51:53,979 --> 01:51:56,315
Nothing worked out the way
it was supposed to.

1487
01:51:56,482 --> 01:51:57,525
Let's go.

1488
01:52:05,991 --> 01:52:08,786
All right, buddy, give me a big deep breath.

1489
01:52:13,582 --> 01:52:15,000
What is this?

1490
01:52:15,418 --> 01:52:19,255
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry! I can't let you leave with that ship.

1491
01:52:19,588 --> 01:52:21,924
We're gonna need it
to complete the mission...

1492
01:52:22,258 --> 01:52:25,678
...once the others realize
what this place isn't.

1493
01:52:25,970 --> 01:52:28,722
We cannot survive here. I'm sorry!

1494
01:52:29,181 --> 01:52:30,224
I'm sorry!

1495
01:52:39,984 --> 01:52:43,112
- They can't stay here anymore.
- You have to leave right now.

1496
01:52:43,279 --> 01:52:46,824
Let me make something abundantly clear.
You have a responsibility--

1497
01:52:46,991 --> 01:52:50,119
- Oh! Jesus!
- Coop, get her stuff. She's going home.

1498
01:52:50,453 --> 01:52:52,371
Dad didn't raise you to be this dumb, Tom!

1499
01:52:52,538 --> 01:52:56,625
Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did.
And he's buried out back with Mom and Jesse.

1500
01:52:57,209 --> 01:52:59,879
You faked all the data?

1501
01:53:01,589 --> 01:53:02,673
Yeah.

1502
01:53:06,677 --> 01:53:08,387
There's no surface?

1503
01:53:08,554 --> 01:53:09,722
No.

1504
01:53:10,681 --> 01:53:12,683
I tried to do my duty, Cooper...

1505
01:53:12,850 --> 01:53:17,855
...but I knew the day that I arrived here
that this place had nothing.

1506
01:53:18,481 --> 01:53:22,276
And I resisted the temptation for years...

1507
01:53:22,902 --> 01:53:24,987
...but I knew that...

1508
01:53:25,321 --> 01:53:28,157
...if I just pressed that button, then...

1509
01:53:28,449 --> 01:53:30,451
...somebody would come and save me.

1510
01:53:31,494 --> 01:53:32,995
You fucking coward.

1511
01:53:33,829 --> 01:53:34,872
Yes.

1512
01:53:40,294 --> 01:53:41,337
Yes.

1513
01:53:43,255 --> 01:53:44,298
Yes.

1514
01:53:45,549 --> 01:53:46,592
Yes.

1515
01:53:58,103 --> 01:54:02,650
Listen, if you're not going to go,
let your family go. Just save your family.

1516
01:54:03,150 --> 01:54:05,444
And we go live underground with you?

1517
01:54:05,611 --> 01:54:07,530
Pray that Daddy comes to save us?

1518
01:54:07,696 --> 01:54:11,200
Dad's not coming back.
He never was coming back. It's up to me.

1519
01:54:11,367 --> 01:54:13,244
You're gonna save everybody?

1520
01:54:13,619 --> 01:54:16,455
- Because Dad couldn't do it.
- Dad didn't even try!

1521
01:54:16,622 --> 01:54:18,791
Dad just abandoned us!

1522
01:54:19,542 --> 01:54:21,335
He left us here to die.

1523
01:54:22,044 --> 01:54:23,712
Nobody's going with you.

1524
01:54:27,424 --> 01:54:30,135
You gonna wait for your next kid to die?

1525
01:54:33,138 --> 01:54:34,431
Get out.

1526
01:54:35,307 --> 01:54:36,642
And don't come back.

1527
01:54:41,522 --> 01:54:43,357
You can keep my stuff.

1528
01:54:54,285 --> 01:54:55,661
Stop it!

1529
01:54:58,664 --> 01:55:00,249
No. No!

1530
01:55:01,333 --> 01:55:04,211
Dr. Mann, there's a 50-50 chance
you're gonna kill yourself!

1531
01:55:05,045 --> 01:55:07,047
Those are the best odds I've had in years.

1532
01:55:27,484 --> 01:55:29,320
Don't judge me, Cooper.

1533
01:55:30,070 --> 01:55:32,323
You were never tested like I was.

1534
01:55:32,948 --> 01:55:34,408
Few men have been.

1535
01:55:42,750 --> 01:55:43,917
You tried your best, Murph.

1536
01:55:53,427 --> 01:55:54,803
You're feeling it, aren't you?

1537
01:55:56,472 --> 01:55:58,307
The survival instinct.

1538
01:55:59,224 --> 01:56:03,562
That's what drove me. It's what drives all of us.
And it's what's gonna save us.

1539
01:56:04,730 --> 01:56:08,067
Because I want to save all of us.
For you, Cooper.

1540
01:56:13,238 --> 01:56:16,784
I'm sorry, I can't watch you go through this.
I'm sorry.

1541
01:56:17,117 --> 01:56:19,787
I thought I could, but I can't.

1542
01:56:20,871 --> 01:56:23,040
I'm here. I'm here for you.

1543
01:56:23,332 --> 01:56:25,376
<i>Just listen to my voice, Cooper.</i>

1544
01:56:26,168 --> 01:56:27,503
<i>I'm right here.</i>

1545
01:56:29,338 --> 01:56:30,673
<i>You're not alone.</i>

1546
01:56:40,391 --> 01:56:41,892
Do you see your children?

1547
01:56:45,145 --> 01:56:46,480
<i>It's okay.</i>

1548
01:56:47,439 --> 01:56:49,191
They're right there with you.

1549
01:56:53,070 --> 01:56:55,656
Did Professor Brand tell you
that poem before you left?

1550
01:56:56,490 --> 01:56:57,991
<i>Do you remember?</i>

1551
01:57:00,369 --> 01:57:03,038
<i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>

1552
01:57:04,957 --> 01:57:07,751
<i>Old age should burn and rave</i>

1553
01:57:07,918 --> 01:57:09,503
<i>At close of day</i>

1554
01:57:11,088 --> 01:57:13,465
<i>Rage, rage against the dying of the light</i>

1555
01:57:38,115 --> 01:57:39,783
Brand! Help!

1556
01:57:39,950 --> 01:57:41,910
<i>- Help!
- Cooper?</i>

1557
01:57:48,625 --> 01:57:49,835
CASE!

1558
01:57:50,210 --> 01:57:51,503
No air.

1559
01:57:52,337 --> 01:57:53,547
Ammonia.

1560
01:57:54,631 --> 01:57:57,134
Cooper. Cooper, we're coming! CASE!

1561
01:57:57,301 --> 01:57:59,219
- I have a fix.
- Go! Go, go, go!

1562
01:57:59,386 --> 01:58:01,472
And away!

1563
01:58:13,025 --> 01:58:15,235
Cooper, we're coming.
Hang in there. Don't talk.

1564
01:58:15,402 --> 01:58:17,696
Try to breathe as little as possible.
We're almost there.

1565
01:58:21,366 --> 01:58:23,368
There's a security lockout, sir.

1566
01:58:23,535 --> 01:58:26,789
It requires a person to access function.

1567
01:58:31,835 --> 01:58:33,337
It's all yours, sir.

1568
01:58:41,553 --> 01:58:43,013
<i>Try not to breathe.</i>

1569
01:58:44,014 --> 01:58:45,682
<i>We're coming. We're coming right now.</i>

1570
01:58:45,849 --> 01:58:47,976
<i>CASE, come on! Come on!</i>

1571
01:58:48,143 --> 01:58:50,854
<i>We got to go faster, CASE!
Faster, faster, faster!</i>

1572
01:58:55,359 --> 01:58:57,069
Hang in there. Come on.

1573
01:59:03,575 --> 01:59:06,870
I see him, I see him! CASE, bank! Bank right!

1574
01:59:25,889 --> 01:59:27,432
Cooper! Cooper!

1575
01:59:27,808 --> 01:59:28,892
I'm here!

1576
01:59:52,124 --> 01:59:54,126
This data makes no sense.

1577
02:00:02,551 --> 02:00:03,802
I'm sorry.

1578
02:00:04,136 --> 02:00:06,722
- What?
- Mann was lying!

1579
02:00:14,479 --> 02:00:16,273
Go. Go.

1580
02:00:17,357 --> 02:00:18,400
Romilly.

1581
02:00:18,775 --> 02:00:19,818
<i>Romilly!</i>

1582
02:00:20,152 --> 02:00:22,571
<i>Romilly! Do you read me, Romilly?</i>

1583
02:00:23,155 --> 02:00:25,157
Step back, professor! Step back!

1584
02:00:33,081 --> 02:00:35,667
<i>- Romilly....
- Romilly, do you read me?</i>

1585
02:00:38,670 --> 02:00:40,005
Keep watch!

1586
02:00:41,173 --> 02:00:42,299
Lois?

1587
02:00:42,799 --> 02:00:45,302
- What happened to caution, CASE?
- Safety first, Cooper.

1588
02:00:46,678 --> 02:00:50,098
Romilly? Romilly, do you read me?
This is Brand.

1589
02:00:52,976 --> 02:00:54,019
Romilly?

1590
02:00:54,186 --> 02:00:56,772
Dr. Brand. Cooper.
There's been an explosion.

1591
02:00:57,397 --> 02:00:59,191
Dr. Mann's compound.

1592
02:01:26,802 --> 02:01:28,845
TARS, TARS, 10 o'clock!

1593
02:01:35,227 --> 02:01:37,187
Let me know when TARS is aboard.

1594
02:01:40,816 --> 02:01:42,693
Romilly did not survive.

1595
02:01:43,902 --> 02:01:45,570
I could not save him.

1596
02:01:45,737 --> 02:01:47,197
- TARS is in.
- I'll take her now.

1597
02:01:47,364 --> 02:01:50,242
- Do we have a fix on the Ranger?
- He's pushing into orbit!

1598
02:01:50,409 --> 02:01:53,412
If he takes control of that ship, we're dead.

1599
02:01:54,621 --> 02:01:57,582
- He'd maroon us?
- He is marooning us.

1600
02:01:59,584 --> 02:02:02,087
I'll meet you guys downstairs.
Go wait by the car.

1601
02:02:09,928 --> 02:02:14,141
Come on! Give me your bag.
Get in the backseat. Get in the backseat now!

1602
02:02:19,771 --> 02:02:21,690
<i>Dr. Mann, please respond.</i>

1603
02:02:22,315 --> 02:02:24,401
Dr. Mann, please respond!

1604
02:02:24,568 --> 02:02:26,778
<i>He doesn't know
the Endurance docking procedure.</i>

1605
02:02:26,945 --> 02:02:29,448
- The autopilot does.
- Not since TARS disabled it.

1606
02:02:30,657 --> 02:02:31,700
Nice.

1607
02:02:31,867 --> 02:02:34,786
<i>- What's your trust setting, TARS?
- Lower than yours apparently.</i>

1608
02:02:38,415 --> 02:02:41,960
<i>Do not attempt docking.
I repeat, do not attempt docking.</i>

1609
02:02:42,127 --> 02:02:43,170
<i>Please res--</i>

1610
02:03:42,604 --> 02:03:44,981
<i>Auto-docking sequence withheld.</i>

1611
02:03:45,148 --> 02:03:47,818
<i>- Override.
- Unauthorized.</i>

1612
02:03:48,527 --> 02:03:49,861
Override.

1613
02:03:50,362 --> 02:03:52,239
<i>Unauthorized.</i>

02:03:56,368 --> 02:04:00,497
Do not attempt docking. I repeat,
do not attempt docking. Please resp--

1615
02:04:44,291 --> 02:04:46,459
<i>Moving slowly toward the Endurance.</i>

1616
02:05:10,984 --> 02:05:12,569
<i>Imperfect contact.</i>

1617
02:05:12,736 --> 02:05:14,779
<i>- Override.
- Hatch lockout.</i>

1618
02:05:22,579 --> 02:05:25,123
- Is he locked on yet?
- Imperfectly.

1619
02:05:26,958 --> 02:05:28,210
Dr. Mann, do not--

1620
02:05:49,689 --> 02:05:52,692
<i>Hatch lockout disengaged.</i>

1621
02:06:01,243 --> 02:06:04,746
Dr. Mann, do not,
I repeat, do not open the hatch.

1622
02:06:05,080 --> 02:06:06,957
I repeat, do not open the hatch.

1623
02:06:07,123 --> 02:06:09,960
If you open the hatch,
the airlock will depressurize.

1624
02:06:35,860 --> 02:06:38,154
- What happens if he blows the airlock?
- Nothing good.

1625
02:06:44,035 --> 02:06:46,663
Okay, pull back. Retro thrusters,
everything we've got, CASE!

1626
02:06:46,830 --> 02:06:48,540
- Thrusters are full!
- Back!

1627
02:06:48,707 --> 02:06:50,709
Relay my transmission
to the onboard computer...

1628
02:06:50,875 --> 02:06:52,961
...and have it rebroadcast as emergency P.A.

1629
02:06:53,128 --> 02:06:54,170
Dr. Mann--

1630
02:06:56,756 --> 02:06:59,634
<i>I repeat, do not open
the inner hatch. I repeat--</i>

1631
02:06:59,801 --> 02:07:00,844
Brand?

1632
02:07:01,678 --> 02:07:03,722
<i>I don't know what he said to you...</i>

1633
02:07:03,888 --> 02:07:06,558
<i>...but I am taking command
of the Endurance.</i>

1634
02:07:07,017 --> 02:07:09,060
<i>And then we can talk
about completing the mission.</i>

1635
02:07:12,522 --> 02:07:14,232
Dr. Mann, listen to me.

1636
02:07:15,025 --> 02:07:17,027
This is not about my life.

1637
02:07:17,652 --> 02:07:20,905
Or Cooper's life. This is about all mankind.

1638
02:07:21,489 --> 02:07:22,907
There is a moment--

1639
02:07:29,247 --> 02:07:30,582
It is not sa--

1640
02:07:38,882 --> 02:07:39,924
Oh, my God.

1641
02:07:58,234 --> 02:08:02,197
<i>- There's no point using fuel to chase--
- Analyze the Endurance's spin.</i>

1642
02:08:07,452 --> 02:08:09,662
- Cooper, what are you doing?
- Docking.

1643
02:08:14,250 --> 02:08:17,087
<i>Endurance rotation is 67, 68 RPM.</i>

1644
02:08:17,253 --> 02:08:19,714
Okay, get ready to match our spin
with the retro thrusters.

1645
02:08:19,881 --> 02:08:21,966
- It's not possible.
- No...

1646
02:08:22,133 --> 02:08:23,301
...it's necessary.

1647
02:08:34,938 --> 02:08:37,107
<i>Endurance is hitting stratosphere!</i>

1648
02:08:41,152 --> 02:08:43,196
She's got no heat shield.

1649
02:08:46,324 --> 02:08:48,076
- CASE, you ready?
- Ready.

1650
02:08:56,501 --> 02:08:59,671
Cooper! This is no time for caution.

1651
02:09:01,214 --> 02:09:03,675
CASE, if I black out, you take the stick.

1652
02:09:03,842 --> 02:09:06,302
TARS, get ready to engage
the docking mechanism.

1653
02:09:13,351 --> 02:09:14,853
<i>Endurance is starting to heat.</i>

1654
02:09:15,019 --> 02:09:16,354
Twenty feet out.

1655
02:09:16,521 --> 02:09:19,023
I need three degrees starboard, Cooper.

1656
02:09:19,190 --> 02:09:21,192
Ten feet out.

1657
02:09:21,359 --> 02:09:23,862
Cooper, we are lined up.

1658
02:09:24,028 --> 02:09:25,613
Initiating spin!

1659
02:10:07,197 --> 02:10:08,406
Come on, TARS.

1660
02:10:16,664 --> 02:10:18,208
Come on, TARS!

1661
02:10:29,427 --> 02:10:31,846
<i>- We are locked, Cooper.
- Locked. Easing up!</i>

1662
02:10:39,729 --> 02:10:41,064
Easy.

1663
02:10:42,232 --> 02:10:43,566
Easy.

1664
02:10:49,405 --> 02:10:50,907
Retro thrusters!

1665
02:10:58,873 --> 02:11:00,375
Main engines on.

1666
02:11:06,130 --> 02:11:08,841
Pushing out of orbit. Come on, baby.

1667
02:11:16,849 --> 02:11:18,518
Killing main engines!

1668
02:11:19,769 --> 02:11:21,437
Okay, we're out of orbit.

1669
02:11:28,778 --> 02:11:31,656
Okay. And for our next trick!

1670
02:11:33,491 --> 02:11:37,328
It'll have to be good.
We're heading into Gargantua's pull.

1671
02:11:38,246 --> 02:11:39,289
Oh, shit.

1672
02:11:39,789 --> 02:11:41,583
- CASE, take the stick.
- Roger that.

1673
02:12:31,549 --> 02:12:33,885
<i>Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua.</i>

1674
02:12:35,219 --> 02:12:37,180
<i>Shall I use main engines?</i>

1675
02:12:37,347 --> 02:12:38,389
No.

1676
02:12:38,973 --> 02:12:41,225
We got to let her slide as far as we can.

1677
02:12:50,026 --> 02:12:52,904
- Give it to me.
- There's good news, there's bad news.

1678
02:12:53,071 --> 02:12:56,699
Yeah, I've heard that one, TARS.
Give it to me straight.

1679
02:13:05,541 --> 02:13:08,753
The backup generator kicked in,
so the system's stable. They're all good.

1680
02:13:08,920 --> 02:13:09,962
Good.

1681
02:13:10,380 --> 02:13:13,716
Okay. The navigational hub
has been completely destroyed.

1682
02:13:13,883 --> 02:13:16,844
We don't have enough life support
to make it back to Earth...

1683
02:13:17,011 --> 02:13:19,097
...but we can scratch our way
to Edmunds' planet.

1684
02:13:19,263 --> 02:13:20,598
What about fuel?

1685
02:13:21,015 --> 02:13:23,518
Not enough. But I have a plan.

1686
02:13:24,143 --> 02:13:28,147
<i>We let Gargantua pull us down
close to her horizon.</i>

1687
02:13:28,648 --> 02:13:31,901
<i>Then a powered slingshot around,
launching us towards Edmunds' planet.</i>

1688
02:13:32,068 --> 02:13:34,570
<i>- Manually?
- That's what I'm here for.</i>

1689
02:13:34,737 --> 02:13:37,448
<i>I'm gonna take us just inside the critical orbit.</i>

1690
02:13:37,615 --> 02:13:40,118
<i>- What about time slippage?
- Neither of us has time to worry...</i>

1691
02:13:40,284 --> 02:13:41,953
...about relativity right now, Dr. Brand.

1692
02:13:46,582 --> 02:13:48,084
I'm sorry, Cooper.

1693
02:13:51,212 --> 02:13:54,465
<i>Once we've gathered
enough speed around Gargantua...</i>

1694
02:13:54,799 --> 02:13:56,634
<i>...we use Lander 1...</i>

1695
02:13:57,135 --> 02:13:59,429
<i>...and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters to...</i>

1696
02:14:00,596 --> 02:14:02,598
<i>...push us out of the black hole's gravity.</i>

1697
02:14:04,934 --> 02:14:07,603
<i>The Lander's linkages have been destroyed...</i>

1698
02:14:07,770 --> 02:14:10,106
<i>...so we'll have to control manually.</i>

1699
02:14:11,315 --> 02:14:14,777
<i>Once Lander 1 is spent, TARS will detach--</i>

1700
02:14:14,944 --> 02:14:16,654
And get sucked into that black hole.

1701
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:19,240
Why does TARS have to detach?

1702
02:14:19,407 --> 02:14:21,451
We have to shed the weight
to escape the gravity.

1703
02:14:21,617 --> 02:14:22,994
<i>Newton's third law.</i>

1704
02:14:23,161 --> 02:14:25,872
<i>The only way humans have ever
figured out of getting somewhere...</i>

1705
02:14:26,038 --> 02:14:27,582
<i>...is to leave something behind.</i>

1706
02:14:27,749 --> 02:14:30,793
Cooper, you can't ask TARS
to do this for us.

1707
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:34,797
He's a robot. So you don't have
to ask him to do anything.

1708
02:14:34,964 --> 02:14:36,257
<i>Cooper, you asshole!</i>

1709
02:14:36,632 --> 02:14:38,634
Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.

1710
02:14:38,885 --> 02:14:41,137
It's what we intended, Dr. Brand.

1711
02:14:41,471 --> 02:14:43,931
It's our only chance to save people on Earth.

1712
02:14:44,098 --> 02:14:47,310
<i>If I can find a way to transmit
the quantum data I'll find in there...</i>

1713
02:14:47,477 --> 02:14:49,312
<i>...they might still make it.</i>

1714
02:14:50,354 --> 02:14:52,982
Let's just hope
there's still someone there to save.

1715
02:15:21,469 --> 02:15:23,137
<i>Maximum velocity achieved.</i>

1716
02:15:24,388 --> 02:15:26,891
Prepare to fire escape thrusters.

1717
02:15:27,058 --> 02:15:28,142
Ready?

1718
02:15:28,309 --> 02:15:29,727
Ready.

1719
02:15:29,894 --> 02:15:31,062
Ready.

1720
02:15:31,229 --> 02:15:33,022
Main engine ignition in three...

1721

Come on, baby.

1724
02:15:52,667 --> 02:15:54,836
Lander 1 engines, on my mark.

1725

<i>- Mark.
- Fire!</i>

1731
02:16:21,737 --> 02:16:24,907
This little maneuver's
gonna cost us 51 years!

1732
02:16:25,783 --> 02:16:28,286
You don't sound so bad for pushing 120!

1733
02:16:43,676 --> 02:16:46,846
<i>Lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark.</i>

1734

<i>...one. Mark.</i>

1736

<i>- Goodbye, TARS.

1738

- See you on the other side, Coop.
- See you there, Slick!

1739
02:17:11,329 --> 02:17:12,914
Okay, CASE.

1740
02:17:13,956 --> 02:17:17,335
<i>- Nice reckless flying!

- What?

1742
02:17:20,546 --> 02:17:23,466
No! No! Cooper! What are you doing?

1743
02:17:23,925 --> 02:17:27,637
Newton's third law.
You got to leave something behind.

1744
02:17:27,803 --> 02:17:30,222
You told me we had enough resources
for both of us.

1745
02:17:30,389 --> 02:17:32,141
<i>We agreed, Amelia...</i>

Don't.

Detach.

1749
02:17:53,412 --> 02:17:56,165
Okay, I am nosing down.

1750
02:17:59,961 --> 02:18:01,963
Approaching the event horizon.

1751
02:18:04,215 --> 02:18:06,467
Portside, dipping down beneath it...

1752
02:18:07,051 --> 02:18:08,719
...to go through it.

1753
02:18:10,304 --> 02:18:13,140
<i>Heading towards blackness.</i>

1754
02:18:13,474 --> 02:18:15,476
<i>I have a visual of the event.</i>

02:18:15,977 --> 02:18:17,353
It's all black.

1756
02:18:19,480 --> 02:18:21,148
TARS, do you read me?

1757
02:18:21,482 --> 02:18:22,984
It's all blackness.

1758
02:18:24,986 --> 02:18:26,988
TARS! Do you read me? Over.

1759
02:18:31,826 --> 02:18:32,994
Okay.

1760
02:18:34,203 --> 02:18:35,454
Screens...

1761
02:18:37,081 --> 02:18:38,582
...getting interference.

1762
02:18:40,292 --> 02:18:42,878
Losing control of the stick. I got flashes.

1763
02:18:43,462 --> 02:18:45,631
Flashes of lightness and blackness.

1764
02:18:46,841 --> 02:18:49,343
The turbulence in the gravity is increasing.

1765
02:18:54,265 --> 02:18:55,516
Ah.

1766
02:18:56,017 --> 02:18:58,853
The computers are going down. Agh.

1767
02:19:09,947 --> 02:19:12,783
Gravitational pull.
I'm losing control of the stick.

1768
02:19:46,150 --> 02:19:47,818
Murph? Murph, come on!

1769
02:19:53,491 --> 02:19:55,493
<i>Eject. Eject.</i>

1770

Murph! Murph! Murph!

1776
02:22:16,800 --> 02:22:17,843
Murph!

1777
02:22:25,059 --> 02:22:26,977
No, no, no!

No! No!

1781
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:32,960
If you're leaving, just go.

1782
02:23:33,460 --> 02:23:34,628
No, no. No.

1783
02:23:36,213 --> 02:23:38,549
No, don't go. Don't go, you idiot.

1784
02:23:38,716 --> 02:23:40,009
Don't go!

1785
02:23:41,969 --> 02:23:43,637
Morse. Morse.

1786
02:23:44,388 --> 02:23:45,431
Morse.

1787
02:23:46,640 --> 02:23:48,434
Dot. Dot.

02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:49,643
S.

1789
02:23:55,774 --> 02:23:56,817
T.

1790
02:24:01,405 --> 02:24:02,489
A.

1791
02:24:02,656 --> 02:24:03,741
Dash!

1792
02:24:06,535 --> 02:24:07,870
Dash! Dash!

1793
02:24:08,370 --> 02:24:09,413
Murph!

1794
02:24:09,580 --> 02:24:11,582
Murph, we don't have time for this! Come on!

1795
02:24:11,999 --> 02:24:13,125
Y.

1796
02:24:18,422 --> 02:24:19,465
"Stay!"

1797
02:24:30,559 --> 02:24:32,895
Come on. Come on, Murph. Come on!

1798
02:24:33,562 --> 02:24:35,356
What's it say? What's it say, Murph?

1799
02:24:36,148 --> 02:24:37,232
What's it say?

1800
02:24:47,785 --> 02:24:48,911
"Stay."

1801
02:25:24,655 --> 02:25:26,115
Tell him, Murph.

1802
02:25:26,281 --> 02:25:27,491
Make him stay.

1803
02:25:30,828 --> 02:25:32,496
Make him stay, Murph.

1804
02:25:41,505 --> 02:25:43,382
Make him stay, Murph.

1805
02:25:44,842 --> 02:25:46,969
Don't let me leave, Murph!

1806
02:25:50,180 --> 02:25:52,599
Don't let me leave, Murph!

1807
02:25:58,397 --> 02:26:00,732
No! No! No!

1808
02:26:21,420 --> 02:26:22,921
It was you.

1809
02:26:34,391 --> 02:26:36,435
You were my ghost.

1810
02:26:46,153 --> 02:26:49,156
<i>Cooper. Cooper. Come in, Cooper.</i>

1811
02:26:50,949 --> 02:26:53,452
<i>- TARS?
- Roger that.</i>

1812
02:26:55,245 --> 02:26:57,873
<i>- You survived.
- Somewhere...</i>

1813
02:26:58,415 --> 02:27:00,459
<i>...in their fifth dimension.</i>

1814
02:27:00,626 --> 02:27:02,961
<i>They saved us.</i>

1815
02:27:03,128 --> 02:27:08,342
Yeah? Who the hell is "they"?
And just why would they want to help us?

1816
02:27:08,509 --> 02:27:11,220
<i>I don't know, but they constructed
this three-dimensional space...</i>

1817
02:27:11,386 --> 02:27:14,681
<i>...inside their five-dimensional reality
to allow you to understand it.</i>

1818
02:27:14,848 --> 02:27:16,808
Yeah, that ain't working.

1819
02:27:16,975 --> 02:27:18,519
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

1820
02:27:18,685 --> 02:27:22,564
<i>You've seen that time is represented here
as a physical dimension.</i>

1821
02:27:22,731 --> 02:27:25,567
<i>You have worked out that you can exert
a force across space-time.</i>

1822
02:27:26,235 --> 02:27:29,404
Gravity to send a message.

1823
02:27:29,780 --> 02:27:31,114
<i>Affirmative.</i>

1824
02:27:33,700 --> 02:27:34,826
Gravity...

1825
02:27:35,953 --> 02:27:39,289
...can cross the dimensions, including time.

1826
02:27:39,623 --> 02:27:40,916
<i>Apparently.</i>

1827
02:27:44,795 --> 02:27:46,797
Do you have the quantum data?

1828
02:27:47,214 --> 02:27:48,840
<i>Roger. I have it.</i>

1829
02:27:49,800 --> 02:27:53,804
<i>I am transmitting it on all wavelengths,
but nothing is getting out, Cooper.</i>

1830
02:27:53,971 --> 02:27:56,223
I can do this. I can do this.

1831
02:27:56,682 --> 02:27:59,434
<i>But such complicated data to a child?</i>

1832
02:27:59,601 --> 02:28:00,727
Not just any child.

1833
02:28:00,894 --> 02:28:02,271
What else?

1834
02:28:02,813 --> 02:28:04,982
Oh, come on, Dad.

1835
02:28:07,150 --> 02:28:09,319
Murph, the fire's out! Come on!

1836
02:28:09,486 --> 02:28:13,490
<i>Even if you communicate it here,
she won't understand its significance for years.</i>

1837
02:28:14,283 --> 02:28:15,742
I get that, TARS.

1838
02:28:15,909 --> 02:28:20,581
But we've got to figure something out
or the people on Earth are gonna die. Think!

1839
02:28:20,747 --> 02:28:22,332
<i>Cooper...</i>

1840
02:28:22,499 --> 02:28:25,002
<i>...they didn't bring us here
to change the past.</i>

1841
02:28:28,589 --> 02:28:30,090
Say that again.

1842
02:28:30,257 --> 02:28:33,719
<i>They didn't bring us here to change the past.</i>

1843
02:28:38,140 --> 02:28:40,100
No, they didn't bring us here at all.

1844
02:28:44,730 --> 02:28:46,398
We brought ourselves.

1845
02:28:55,657 --> 02:28:59,703
TARS, give me the coordinates
for NASA in binary.

1846
02:29:00,245 --> 02:29:02,706
<i>In binary. Roger. Feeding data.</i>

1847
02:29:27,022 --> 02:29:28,940
"It's not a ghost."

1848
02:29:30,692 --> 02:29:32,194
"It's gravity."

1849
02:29:32,527 --> 02:29:34,196
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

1850
02:29:34,863 --> 02:29:36,657
I brought myself here!

1851
02:29:37,532 --> 02:29:41,036
We're here to communicate
with the three-dimensional world.

1852
02:29:41,453 --> 02:29:42,954
We're the bridge!

1853
02:29:50,962 --> 02:29:52,756
I thought they chose me.

1854
02:29:56,093 --> 02:29:59,763
<i>- But they didn't choose me, they chose her.
- For what, Cooper?</i>

1855
02:30:02,265 --> 02:30:03,934
To save the world.

1856
02:30:08,230 --> 02:30:12,609
All of this is one little girl's bedroom.
Every moment.

1857
02:30:12,943 --> 02:30:14,361
It's infinitely complex.

1858
02:30:14,528 --> 02:30:19,282
They have access to infinite time and space,
but they're not bound by anything!

1859
02:30:19,449 --> 02:30:24,121
They can't find a specific place in time.
They can't communicate.

1860
02:30:25,622 --> 02:30:28,625
That's why I'm here.
I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph...

1861
02:30:28,792 --> 02:30:30,293
...just like I found this moment.

1862
02:30:30,460 --> 02:30:32,796
<i>- How, Cooper?
- Love, TARS, love.</i>

1863
02:30:32,963 --> 02:30:37,384
It's just like Brand said. My connection
with Murph, it is quantifiable. It's the key!

1864
02:30:37,551 --> 02:30:39,428
<i>What are we here to do?</i>

1865
02:30:40,345 --> 02:30:42,222
Find how to tell her.

1866
02:30:45,016 --> 02:30:46,351
The watch.

1867
02:30:49,479 --> 02:30:50,647
The watch.

1868
02:30:52,023 --> 02:30:53,150
That's it.

1869
02:30:55,652 --> 02:30:58,655
We code the data into the movement
of the second hand.

1870
02:31:02,284 --> 02:31:05,495
TARS, translate the data into Morse
and feed it to me.

1871
02:31:05,662 --> 02:31:09,958
<i>Translating data to Morse.
Cooper, what if she never came back for it?</i>

1872
02:31:11,626 --> 02:31:14,296
She will. She will.

1873
02:31:15,505 --> 02:31:17,132
Murph, I can see his car!

1874
02:31:18,341 --> 02:31:19,509
He's coming, Murph!

1875
02:31:21,344 --> 02:31:23,180
Okay. I'm coming down.

1876
02:31:24,639 --> 02:31:26,141
<i>How do you know?</i>

1877
02:31:29,352 --> 02:31:31,188
Because I gave it to her.

1878
02:31:36,568 --> 02:31:39,070
<i>Roger. Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.</i>

1879
02:31:42,574 --> 02:31:43,700
Dot-dot...

1880
02:31:45,035 --> 02:31:46,703
...dash-dot.

1881
02:31:47,162 --> 02:31:48,830
<i>Dot-dash-dot-dot.</i>

1882
02:31:49,206 --> 02:31:51,875
Dot-dash-dot-dot.

1883
02:31:52,375 --> 02:31:53,710
<i>Dash-dash-dash.</i>

1884
02:31:54,044 --> 02:31:56,296
Dash, dash, dash.

1885
02:32:14,564 --> 02:32:15,899
He came back!

1886
02:32:16,817 --> 02:32:20,987
It was him all the time!
I didn't know. It was him!

1887
02:32:22,072 --> 02:32:24,032
Dad's gonna save us.

1888
02:33:06,783 --> 02:33:08,034
Eureka!

1889
02:33:11,788 --> 02:33:13,123
It's traditional.

1890
02:33:17,711 --> 02:33:19,337
Eureka!

1891
02:33:24,050 --> 02:33:25,552
Did it work?

1892
02:33:25,719 --> 02:33:27,554
<i>I think it might have.</i>

1893
02:33:28,930 --> 02:33:30,223
How do you know?

1894
02:33:30,390 --> 02:33:33,768
<i>Because the bulk beings
are closing the tesseract.</i>

1895
02:33:37,606 --> 02:33:39,608
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

1896
02:33:40,775 --> 02:33:42,611
They're not "beings."

1897
02:33:43,278 --> 02:33:44,613
They're us.

1898
02:33:46,656 --> 02:33:49,784
What I've been doing for Murph,
they're doing for me.

1899
02:33:50,327 --> 02:33:51,828
For all of us.

1900
02:33:51,995 --> 02:33:54,247
<i>Cooper, people couldn't build this.</i>

1901
02:33:54,414 --> 02:33:56,791
No. No, not yet.

1902
02:33:57,167 --> 02:33:58,627
But one day.

1903
02:33:59,294 --> 02:34:02,505
Not you and me. But people.

1904
02:34:03,173 --> 02:34:07,218
A civilization that's evolved past
the four dimensions we know.

1905
02:34:13,808 --> 02:34:15,310
<i>What happens now?</i>

1906
02:35:17,914 --> 02:35:19,374
Mr. Cooper.

1907
02:35:23,586 --> 02:35:25,296
All right. Let's take it slow, sir.

1908
02:35:25,714 --> 02:35:27,841
Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.

1909
02:35:28,008 --> 02:35:33,054
Remember, you're no spring chicken anymore.
Actually, you are 124 years old.

1910
02:35:40,061 --> 02:35:41,396
Take it slow, sir.

1911
02:35:42,313 --> 02:35:44,607
You were, uh, extremely lucky.

1912
02:35:44,941 --> 02:35:48,278
The Rangers found you with only minutes
left in your oxygen supply.

1913
02:36:02,459 --> 02:36:03,793
Where am I?

1914
02:36:05,462 --> 02:36:07,005
Cooper Station.

1915
02:36:08,423 --> 02:36:09,966
Currently orbiting Saturn.

1916
02:36:11,968 --> 02:36:14,012
Cooper Station.

1917
02:36:16,473 --> 02:36:18,475
Nice of you to name it after me.

1918
02:36:22,312 --> 02:36:23,396
What?

1919
02:36:23,563 --> 02:36:26,775
The station isn't named after you, sir.
It's, uh, named after your daughter.

1920
02:36:27,275 --> 02:36:30,278
Although she's always maintained
just how important you were.

1921
02:36:30,445 --> 02:36:32,155
Is she still alive?

1922
02:36:34,115 --> 02:36:35,992
She'll be here in a couple weeks.

1923
02:36:37,035 --> 02:36:39,496
She is far too old to be transferring
from another station...

1924
02:36:39,662 --> 02:36:42,040
...but when she heard
that you'd been found...

1925
02:36:43,249 --> 02:36:45,960
...well, this is, uh, Murphy Cooper
we're talking about.

1926
02:36:46,836 --> 02:36:48,338
Yes, it is.

1927
02:36:50,465 --> 02:36:52,967
We'll have you checked out of here
in a couple days.

1928
02:36:55,637 --> 02:36:58,139
I'm sure you'll be excited to see
what's in store.

1929
02:36:59,390 --> 02:37:03,353
I actually, uh, did a paper on you
in high school.

1930
02:37:03,686 --> 02:37:06,022
I know all about your life back on Earth.

1931
02:37:07,690 --> 02:37:08,858
Oh, yeah.

1932
02:37:09,025 --> 02:37:10,276
Right.

1933
02:37:12,695 --> 02:37:18,034
If-- If you'll follow me,
we've got a really good situation for you.

1934
02:37:21,371 --> 02:37:25,416
So, uh, when I made my suggestion
to Miss Cooper...

1935
02:37:26,334 --> 02:37:29,129
...I was delighted to hear
that she thought it was perfect.

1936
02:37:32,507 --> 02:37:35,802
<i>It was just constant.
Just that steady blow of dirt.</i>

1937
02:37:35,969 --> 02:37:38,888
Of course, I didn't speak to her personally.

1938
02:37:39,055 --> 02:37:41,057
<i>We always set the plate upside-down.</i>

1939
02:37:41,224 --> 02:37:43,977
<i>Glasses or cups,
whatever it was, upside-down.</i>

1940
02:37:44,144 --> 02:37:49,065
<i>Well, my dad was a farmer.
Uh, like everybody else back then.</i>

1941
02:37:49,232 --> 02:37:51,693
<i>There just wasn't enough food.</i>

1942
02:37:51,860 --> 02:37:54,571
<i>We wore little things, little strips...</i>

1943
02:37:54,737 --> 02:37:59,909
<i>...of sheet over our nose and mouth
so we wouldn't breathe so much of it.</i>

1944
02:38:00,076 --> 02:38:03,538
<i>Well, it was pretty exciting for me
because it was hope.</i>

1945
02:38:03,705 --> 02:38:07,917
<i>I don't care who describes it, there is
no way for it to be exaggerated. It was that bad.</i>

1946
02:38:08,084 --> 02:38:11,754
She did confirm
just how much you loved farming.

1947
02:38:12,088 --> 02:38:13,756
- Oh, she did, did she?
- Yeah.

1948
02:38:13,923 --> 02:38:15,133
Come here.

1949
02:38:15,717 --> 02:38:20,680
Home sweet home.
Everything replaced and put back where it....

1950
02:38:27,061 --> 02:38:29,105
- Hey, is this...?
- Oh, yeah.

1951
02:38:29,272 --> 02:38:32,275
The machine we found out near Saturn
when we found you. Yes.

1952
02:38:32,442 --> 02:38:35,111
Its, uh, power source was shot,
but we could get you another one.

1953
02:38:35,278 --> 02:38:37,447
Yes. Please.

1954
02:38:38,656 --> 02:38:39,991
Settings.

1955
02:38:40,450 --> 02:38:41,951
General settings.

1956
02:38:42,452 --> 02:38:44,287
Security settings.

1957
02:38:46,998 --> 02:38:49,292
Honesty, new setting:

1958
02:38:50,460 --> 02:38:52,086
95 percent.

1959
02:38:52,420 --> 02:38:54,923
Confirmed. Additional customization?

1960
02:38:55,798 --> 02:38:56,925
Humor:

1961
02:38:58,426 --> 02:38:59,928
75 percent.

1962
02:39:00,303 --> 02:39:01,638
Confirmed.

1963
02:39:02,305 --> 02:39:05,433
Auto self-destruct T-minus 10, nine....

1964
02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:07,518
Let's make that 60 percent.

1965
02:39:09,812 --> 02:39:11,940
Sixty percent confirmed.

1966
02:39:12,565 --> 02:39:15,652
- Knock-knock.
- You want 55?

1967
02:39:20,531 --> 02:39:22,659
Is this really what it was like?

1968
02:39:24,869 --> 02:39:27,288
It was never this clean, Slick. Heh.

1969
02:39:31,793 --> 02:39:35,463
I don't care much for this pretending
we're back where we started.

1970
02:39:37,548 --> 02:39:39,842
I want to know where we are.

1971
02:39:41,469 --> 02:39:43,012
<i>Where we're going.</i>

1972
02:39:47,558 --> 02:39:50,645
- Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there.
- Yeah.

1973
02:39:50,812 --> 02:39:51,896
Family?

1974
02:39:52,063 --> 02:39:55,942
Yeah, they all came out to see her.
She's been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.

1975
02:40:29,017 --> 02:40:30,893
You told them I like farming.

1976
02:40:36,858 --> 02:40:38,526
It was me, Murph.

1977
02:40:40,987 --> 02:40:42,780
I was your ghost.

1978
02:40:44,073 --> 02:40:45,700
I know.

1979
02:40:47,493 --> 02:40:52,206
People didn't believe me.
They thought that I was doing it all myself.

1980
02:40:52,373 --> 02:40:53,416
But...

1981
02:40:56,294 --> 02:40:58,254
...I knew who it was.

1982
02:41:03,217 --> 02:41:05,386
Nobody believed me.

1983
02:41:05,887 --> 02:41:08,306
But I knew you'd come back.

1984
02:41:10,892 --> 02:41:12,101
How?

1985
02:41:14,103 --> 02:41:17,231
Because my dad promised me.

1986
02:41:23,279 --> 02:41:25,281
Well, I'm here now, Murph.

1987
02:41:26,574 --> 02:41:27,909
I'm here.

1988
02:41:29,369 --> 02:41:30,703
No.

1989
02:41:32,789 --> 02:41:36,918
No parent should have to watch
their own child die.

1990
02:41:39,837 --> 02:41:42,507
I have my kids here for me now.

1991
02:41:45,301 --> 02:41:46,803
You go.

1992
02:41:49,722 --> 02:41:51,224
Where?

1993
02:41:54,727 --> 02:41:56,312
Brand.

1994
02:42:06,155 --> 02:42:07,782
<i>She's out there...</i>

1995
02:42:14,205 --> 02:42:15,957
<i>...setting up camp.</i>

1996
02:42:42,442 --> 02:42:44,152
<i>Alone...</i>

1997
02:42:45,319 --> 02:42:47,989
<i>...in a strange galaxy.</i>

1998
02:42:58,875 --> 02:43:03,546
<i>Maybe right now
she's settling in for the long nap...</i>

1999
02:43:21,898 --> 02:43:24,734
<i>...by the light of our new sun...</i>

2000
02:43:40,208 --> 02:43:42,251
<i>...in our new home.</i>
