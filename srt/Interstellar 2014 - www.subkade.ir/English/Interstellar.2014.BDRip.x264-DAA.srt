2
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,993
Well, my dad was a farmer.

3
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:20,621
Um, like everybody else back then.

4
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,917
Of course, he didn't start that way.

5
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,136
Computer says you're too tight.

6
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,845
- Nah, I got this.
- Crossing the Straights.

7
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,016
- Shutting it down, Cooper.
- No!

8
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,936
- Shutting it all down.
- No, I need power up!

9
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,317
Dad?

10
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,367
Sorry, Murph. Go back to bed.

11
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,204
- I thought you were the ghost.
- No.

12
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,874
There are no such things as ghosts, babe.

13
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,210
Grandpa says you can get ghosts.

14
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:13,382
Maybe that's because Grandpa's close
to being one himself. Back to bed.

15
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,551
Were you dreaming about the crash?

16
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,263
Get your butt back in bed, Murph. Heh.

17
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,792
The wheat had died.

18
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,962
The blight came and we had to burn it.

19
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,590
And we still had corn.
We had acres of corn.

20
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,009
But, uh, mostly we had dust.

21
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,056
I guess I can't describe it.
It was just constant.

22
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:06,102
Just that steady blow...
of dirt.

23
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,274
We wore, um, little strips of sheet...

24
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,151
sometimes over our nose and mouth...

25
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,821
so that we wouldn't
breathe so much of it.

26
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,033
When we set the table,
we always set the plate...

27
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,120
upside-down.
Glasses or cups, whatever it was...

28
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,454
upside-down.

29
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,129
Shake a leg! Murph, get a move on!

30
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:36,757
Tom, 4:00 today, you and me in the barn,
Herbicide Resistance 101.

31
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,426
- Check?
- Yes, sir.

32
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,637
Not at the table, Murph.

33
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,223
Dad, can you fix this?

34
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,169
What the heck did you do...

35
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:48,477
- to my lander?
- Wasn't me.

36
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,521
Let me guess. It was your ghost?

37
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,024
It knocked it off.
It keeps knocking books off.

38
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,711
No such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass.

39
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,380
Hey.

40
00:03:55,392 --> 00:03:56,986
I looked it up. It's
called a poltergeist.

41
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,404
Dad, tell her.

42
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,489
Well, it's not very scientific, Murph.

43
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,992
You said science was about admitting
what we don't know.

44
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,328
- She's got you there.
- Hey.

45
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,996
Start looking after our stuff.

46
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:09,832
Coop.

47
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,795
All right, Murph, you want to talk science?

48
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:19,008
Don't tell me you're afraid of some ghost.
No, you got to go further.

49
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:22,345
You got to record the facts, analyze,
get to the how and the why...

50
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,431
then present your conclusions. Deal?

51
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,516
- Deal.
- All right.

52
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,521
- Have a good day at school.
- Hold up.

53
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,149
Parent-teacher conferences. Parent.

54
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,276
Not grandparent.

55
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,364
Slow down, turbo!

56
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,826
- That's not a dust storm.
- Nelson's torching his whole crop.

57
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,370
Blight?

58
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,956
They're saying it's
the last harvest for okra.

59
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,791
Ever.

60
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,337
He should've planted corn
like the rest of us.

61
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,215
Now, be nice to that Miss Hanley.
She's single.

62
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:00,883
What's that supposed to mean?

63
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:04,178
Repopulating the earth.
Start pulling your weight, young man.

64
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:08,307
Why don't you start
minding your own business, old man?

65
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,274
All right, Murph, give me second.

66
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,111
Uh-huh.

67
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,071
Third.

68
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,282
- Find a gear, dumb-ass.
- Grind it!

69
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,492
Shut it, Tom!

70
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,204
- What'd you do, Murph?
- Ah, she didn't do nothing.

71
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,873
- Blew a tire is all.
- Murphy's Law.

72
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,042
Shut up!

73
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,961
- Grab the spare, Tom.
- That is the spare.

74
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,090
Get the patch kit!

75
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,594
How am I supposed to patch it out
here? COOPER: You got to figure it out.

76
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,722
I'm not always gonna be here to help you.

77
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,898
What's going on, Murph?

78
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,277
Why did you and Mom name me
after something that's bad?

79
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:02,820
We didn't.

80
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,697
Murphy's Law?

81
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:09,744
Murphy's Law doesn't mean
that something bad will happen.

82
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,289
What it means is
whatever can happen will happen.

83
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:16,000
And that sounded just fine with us.

84
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,756
Whoa!

85
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,632
Get in.

86
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,427
Get in, let's go.

87
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,889
What about the flat tire?

88
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,185
Yeah.

89
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:52,161
It's an Indian Air Force drone.
Solar cells could power an entire farm.

90
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,788
Take the wheel, Tom.

91
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,586
Go, go, go!

92
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,839
Keep that aimed right at it.

93
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,183
Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.

94
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,893
Right at it.

95
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,437
Stay on it.

96
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,107
Here we go.

97
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,236
Whoa.

98
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,951
Nice one, Tom.

99
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,792
Dad?

100
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,962
I almost got it. Don't stop. Don't stop!

101
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,463
Dad!

102
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,006
Tom!

103
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,888
You told me to keep driving.

104
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:58,185
Well, I guess that answers the old "if I
asked you to drive off a cliff" scenario.

105
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,233
- We lost it.
- No, we didn't.

106
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,581
Want to give it a whirl?

107
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:25,963
This way.

108
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,428
Go.

109
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,432
Let's lay her down right there
at the edge of the reservoir.

110
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,438
Nicely done.

111
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,318
How long you think it's been up there?

112
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,029
Delhi Mission Control went down,
same as ours...

113
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,031
- ten years ago.
- Heh.

114
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,283
So for ten years?

115
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,872
- Why did it come down so low?
- I don't know.

116
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,958
Maybe the sun cooked its brain
or it was looking for something.

117
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,377
- What?
- Give me a large flatblade.

118
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,464
Maybe some kind of signal? I don't know.

119
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,221
What are you gonna do with it?

120
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,308
I'm gonna give it something
socially responsible to do...

121
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,518
like drive a combine.

122
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,604
Can't we just let it go?

123
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,566
It wasn't hurting anybody.

124
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,737
This thing needs to learn
how to adapt, Murph...

125
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,530
like the rest of us.

126
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,839
How's this work?
You guys come with?

127
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,038
I've got class.

128
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,832
This one needs to wait.

129
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:48,170
- What did you do?
- They'll tell you about it in there.

130
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,506
- Am I gonna be mad?
- Not with me.

131
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:53,842
- Just please try not to.
- Hey. Relax.

132
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,595
I got this.

133
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,142
Little late, Coop.

134
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,852
Yeah, we had a flat.

135
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,564
And I guess you had to stop off
at the Asian fighter plane store.

136
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,443
No, actually, sir, that's
a surveillance drone.

137
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,363
With outstanding solar cells. It's Indian.

138
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,115
Take a seat.

139
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,742
So, uh...

140
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,037
we got Tom's scores back.

141
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,540
He's going to make an excellent farmer.

142
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:28,210
Yeah, he's got a knack for it.
What about college?

143
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:32,131
The university only takes a handful.
They don't have the resources to...

144
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,591
I still pay my taxes.

145
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,760
Where's that money go?
There's no more armies.

146
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,596
Well, it doesn't go to the university.

147
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,807
Look, Coop, you have to be realistic.

148
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,768
You're ruling my son out for college now?

149
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,814
- The kid's 15.
- Tom's score simply isn't high enough.

150
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,984
What's your waistline? About what, 32?

151
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,502
About a 33 inseam?

152
00:10:53,514 --> 00:10:56,071
I'm not sure I see
what you're getting at.

153
00:10:56,239 --> 00:11:00,659
It takes two numbers to measure your ass
but only one to measure my son's future?

154
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,413
Come on. You're a well-educated man, Coop.

155
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,540
- And a trained pilot.
- And an engineer.

156
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:11,795
Okay, well, right now
we don't need more engineers.

157
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:16,592
We didn't run out of television screens
and planes. We ran out of food.

158
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,346
The world needs farmers.
Good farmers, like you.

159
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,890
- And Tom.
- Uneducated farmers.

160
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,728
We're a caretaker generation, Coop.
And things are getting better.

161
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,925
Maybe your grandkids
will get to be engin...

162
00:11:29,937 --> 00:11:31,023
Are we done here, sir?

163
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,400
No.

164
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,403
Miss Hanley's here to talk about Murph.

165
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,281
Murph is a great kid. She's really bright.

166
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,700
But she's been having a
little trouble lately.

167
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,245
She brought this in to show the students.
The section on the lunar landings.

168
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,915
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.

169
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,376
She always loved the pictures.

170
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,254
It's an old federal textbook. We've
replaced them with the corrected versions.

171
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,464
Corrected?

172
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:59,760
Explaining how the Apollo missions were
faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

173
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,435
You don't believe we went to the moon?

174
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,563
It was a brilliant piece of propaganda.

175
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,566
The Soviets bankrupted themselves
pouring resources...

176
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,985
into rockets and other useless machines.

177
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,237
"Useless machines."

178
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:22,491
If we don't want a repeat of the excess and
wastefulness of the 20th century, then...

179
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,453
we need to teach our kids about
this planet, not tales of leaving it.

180
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:31,291
One of those useless machines
they used to make was called an MRI.

181
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:35,003
If we had any of those left,
the doctors would've been able to find...

182
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,924
the cyst in my wife's brain
before she died instead of afterwards.

183
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,177
Then she'd have been the one
listening to this instead of me...

184
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,431
which would have been a good thing,
because she was always...

185
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,516
the calmer one.

186
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,269
I'm sorry about your wife, Mr. Cooper.

187
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:55,190
But Murph got into a fistfight
with several of her classmates over this...

188
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,025
Apollo nonsense.

189
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,653
So we thought it best
to bring you in and see what ideas...

190
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,489
you might have for dealing
with her behavior on the home front.

191
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,743
Yeah, you know what?
Um, there's a game tomorrow night.

192
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,037
She's going through a bit
of a baseball phase.

193
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:13,417
Her favorite team is playing.
There's gonna be candy and soda and...

194
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,338
I think I'll take her to that.

195
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,928
How'd it go?

196
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,723
I got you suspended.

197
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,475
- What?
- Cooper.

198
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,394
This is Cooper. Go.

199
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,397
Coop, those combines you rebuilt
went haywire.

200
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,733
Just reset the controllers.

201
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,694
I did that. Now you
should come take a look.

202
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,425
One by one they've been
peeling off the fields and heading over.

203
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,427
Something's interfering with the compass.

204
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,306
Magnetism or some such.

205
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,892
Nothing special about which book.

206
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,812
I've been working on it, like you said.

207
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,065
- I counted the spaces.
- Why?

208
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,194
In case the ghost is trying to communicate.

209
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,530
I'm trying Morse.

210
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,365
Morse?

211
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,783
Yeah.

212
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,828
- Dots and dashes, used...
- I know what Morse code is, Murph.

213
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,914
I just don't think
your bookshelf's trying to talk to you.

214
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,888
Had to reset every compass clock and GPS
to offset for the anomaly.

215
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,725
- Which is?
- I don't know.

216
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,645
If the house was built on magnetic ore...

217
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,898
we'd have seen this the first time
we switched on the tractor.

218
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,738
I hear your meeting at the school
didn't go so well.

219
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,073
Heh. You heard?

220
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,869
It's like we've forgotten
who we are, Donald.

221
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:59,041
Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.

222
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,377
When I was a kid...

223
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:06,673
it felt like they made something new
every day. Some...

224
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,344
gadget or idea.
Like every day was Christmas.

225
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,472
But six billion people...

226
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,891
just try to imagine that.

227
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,895
And every last one of them
trying to have it all.

228
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,192
This world isn't so bad.

229
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,655
And Tom will do just fine.

230
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:34,201
You're the one who doesn't belong. Born
40 years too late, or 40 years too early.

231
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:37,704
My daughter knew it, God bless her.

232
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,375
And your kids know it. Especially Murph.

233
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,128
Well, we used to look up in the sky
and wonder...

234
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,673
at our place in the stars.

235
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:54,471
Now we just look down and worry
about our place in the dirt.

236
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,808
Cooper, you were good at something...

237
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,644
and you never got a chance
to do anything with it.

238
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,771
I'm sorry.

239
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:05,899
You didn't expect...

240
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,610
this dirt that was
giving you this food...

241
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,030
to turn on you like
that and destroy you.

242
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,660
In April... I believe I'm right...
Fifteenth of April, I think.

243
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,413
This happened about 1:30 when that thing...

244
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,498
came off the top of that canyon.

245
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,335
In my day, we had real ballplayers.

246
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,254
Who are these bums?

247
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,132
In my day, people were too busy...

248
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,342
fighting over food
to even play baseball.

249
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:37,514
Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural.
I want a hot dog.

250
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,808
School says you're gonna follow
in my footsteps.

251
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,060
I think that's great.

252
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:45,647
- You think that's great?
- You hate farming, Dad.

253
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,066
Grandpa said.

254
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,651
Grandpa said, huh?

255
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,612
Listen, all that matters
is how you feel about it.

256
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,448
I like what you do.

257
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,658
I like our farm.

258
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,952
You're gonna be great at it.

259
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,300
Let's get out of here.

260
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,559
All right, it's a doozy.

261
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,103
All right, gang, let's mask up.

262
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,442
- Tom? Murph? Check?
- Yeah.

263
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,581
Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows?

264
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,087
Murph?

265
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,776
The ghost.

266
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,654
Grab your pillow.

267
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,282
You're sleeping in with Tom.

268
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,880
It's not a ghost.

269
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,720
It's gravity.

270
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,724
I'm dropping Tom, then heading to town.

271
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:12,187
You want to clean that up
when you've finished praying to it?

272
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,798
It's not Morse, Murph. It's binary.

273
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,258
Thick is one, thin is zero.

274
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,056
Coordinates.

275
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,144
Nope. Mm-mm.

276
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,772
Here we go.

277
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,733
Thirty-three.

278
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:02,737
That's it.

279
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,699
I can't miss this!

280
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,202
Grandpa will be back in
a couple hours, Murph.

281
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,664
But you don't know what you're gonna find.

282
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,000
And that...

283
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,169
is why I can't take you.

284
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,385
Murph?

285
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,974
Grandpa will be home in a while.
Tell him I'll call him on the radio.

286
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,398
- Aah!
- Jesus.

287
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,317
- What are you doing?
- Heh-heh.

288
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,611
Oh, you think this is funny? Huh?

289
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,281
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.

290
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,118
Make yourself useful.

291
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:54,808
Hey, Murph?

292
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,477
Murph!

293
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,316
I think this is the end of the road.

294
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,363
Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?

295
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:10,782
That's my girl.

296
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,769
Step away!

297
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:43,022
Don't shoot! I'm not armed.
My daughter's in the car.

298
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:50,822
- Don't be afraid.
- Aah!

299
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,628
How did you find this place?

300
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,672
Where's my daughter?

301
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:11,885
You had the coordinates for this facility
marked on your map. Where did you get them?

302
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,386
Where's my daughter?

303
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:16,472
Don't make me take you down again.
Sit down!

304
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,017
Oh, you still think you're a Marine, pal?

305
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,769
Marines don't exist anymore.

306
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,677
And I got grunts like
you mowing my grass.

307
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,025
Where did you find
those coordinates?

308
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,777
But you don't look much like a lawnmower.

309
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,780
Think I'll turn you
into an overqualified vacuum cleaner.

310
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,157
No, you won't.

311
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,702
TARS, back down, please.

312
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:42,332
You know, you're taking a risk
using ex-military security.

313
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,628
They're old, and their control units
are unpredictable.

314
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,796
It's what the government could spare.

315
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:51,633
Who are you?

316
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,426
Dr. Brand.

317
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,970
I knew a Dr. Brand once.
He was a professor.

318
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:57,847
What makes you think I'm not?

319
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,642
Wasn't near as cute, either.

320
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,478
Please, Dr. Brand.
I don't have any idea what this is.

321
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,814
Now I'm scared for my daughter
and want her by my side.

322
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,442
You give me that,
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

323
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,823
Get the principals and the girl
in the conference room, please.

324
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,534
Your daughter is fine.

325
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,036
Bright kid.

326
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,455
Must have a very smart mother.

327
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:25,041
It's pretty clear you
don't want any visitors.

328
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:29,170
So why don't you just let us back up from
your fence and we'll be on our way? Huh?

329
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:32,006
- It's not that simple.
- Well, sure, it is.

330
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:36,010
I don't know anything about you.
I don't know anything about this place.

331
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,054
Yes, you do.

332
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:44,852
Dad!

333
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:48,564
Hello, Cooper.

334
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,067
Professor Brand.

335
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,196
Explain to me how you found this facility.

336
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:58,658
Kind of an accident. We sort of stumbled
upon it. We were on a salvage run...

337
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:01,536
You're sitting in the best-kept secret
in the world.

338
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:05,206
Nobody stumbles in here.
Nobody stumbles out.

339
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,208
Cooper, please.

340
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,752
Cooperate with these people.

341
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,129
Look.

342
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,715
It's kind of hard to explain.

343
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:18,219
We learned these coordinates
from an anomaly.

344
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,305
What sort of anomaly?

345
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,766
I hesitate to term it supernatural,
but it definitely wasn't scientific.

346
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:27,854
You're going to have to be specific,
Mr. Cooper. Right now.

347
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:29,272
It was gravity.

348
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:37,155
Um, what sort of gravitational anomaly?
Where was this?

349
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:40,616
Now, I'm real happy that you're excited
about gravity, bud...

350
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,995
but you're not getting any answers
from us until I get assurances.

351
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,455
- Assurances?
- Yeah.

352
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,751
Like, that we're getting out of here.
And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.

353
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,422
Don't you know who we are, Coop?

354
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,840
No, professor, I don't.

355
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,009
You know my father, Professor Brand.

356
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,927
We're NASA.

357
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,931
- NASA?
- NASA.

358
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,059
The same NASA you flew for.

359
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,780
I heard they shut you down, sir...

360
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,240
for refusing to drop bombs
from the stratosphere...

361
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,950
onto starving people.

362
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,453
When they realized
that killing other people was...

363
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,456
not a long-term solution,
then they needed us back.

364
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,625
- In secret.
- Why secret?

365
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:34,629
Because public opinion wouldn't
allow spending on space exploration.

366
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:37,382
Not while you're struggling
to put food on the table.

367
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:39,967
Blight.

368
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:44,263
Wheat seven years ago. Okra this year.

369
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,682
Now there's just corn.

370
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:48,976
And we're growing more than we ever have.

371
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:53,314
But like the potatoes in Ireland
and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...

372
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,401
the corn will die.

373
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,194
Soon.

374
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:07,078
We'll find a way, professor.
We always have.

375
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,833
Driven by the unshakable faith
the Earth is ours.

376
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,210
Not just ours, no.

377
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,337
But it is our home.

378
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:21,008
Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.

379
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,885
We don't even breathe nitrogen.

380
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:28,391
Blight does. And as it thrives,
our air gets less and less oxygen.

381
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,019
The last people to starve
will be the first to suffocate.

382
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,355
And your daughter's generation...

383
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,276
will be the last to survive on Earth.

384
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:42,029
Murph is tired. I was wondering
if she could take a nap in my office.

385
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,031
Yeah. Thank you.

386
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:47,869
Okay...

387
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:52,373
now you need to tell me
what your plan is to save the world.

388
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,544
We're not meant to save the world.
We're meant to leave it.

389
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,426
Rangers.

390
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:08,681
The last components of our one versatile
ship in orbit, the Endurance.

391
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,600
Our final expedition.

392
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:14,353
You sent people out there
looking for a new home?

393
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,272
The Lazarus missions.

394
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:19,567
- Oh, that sounds cheerful.
- Lazarus came back from the dead.

395
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,903
Sure, but he had to die in the first place.

396
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,239
There's not a planet in our solar system
that could sustain life...

397
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,909
and the nearest star's
over a thousand years away.

398
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,745
That doesn't even qualify as futile.

399
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:33,748
Where'd you send them?

400
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,583
Cooper...

401
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,544
I can't tell you anymore
unless you agree...

402
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,546
to pilot this craft.

403
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:44,008
- You're the best pilot we ever had.
- I barely left the stratosphere.

404
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,427
This team never left the simulator.

405
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:50,556
We need a pilot, and this is the mission
that you were trained for.

406
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,225
Without even knowing it?

407
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:57,522
An hour ago, you didn't even know I
was alive. You were going anyway.

408
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,398
We had no choice.

409
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,317
But something sent you here.

410
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:04,362
- They chose you.
- Who's "they"?

411
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,247
How long would I be gone?

412
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,750
Hard to know. Years?

413
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,086
I've got kids, professor.

414
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,630
Get out there and save them.

415
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,385
Who's "they"?

416
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:31,347
We started detecting gravitational
anomalies almost 50 years ago.

417
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:35,309
Mostly small distortions to our instruments
in the upper atmosphere.

418
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,604
In fact, I believe
you encountered one yourself.

419
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:41,274
Yeah, over the Straights.

420
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:45,319
My crash. Something tripped my fly-by-wire.

421
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:46,696
Exactly.

422
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:52,451
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this:

423
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,620
Out near Saturn...

424
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,872
a disturbance of space-time.

425
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:02,128
- Is that a wormhole?
- It appeared 48 years ago.

426
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,505
And it leads where?

427
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,674
Another galaxy.

428
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,678
A wormhole's not
a naturally occurring phenomenon.

429
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,263
Someone placed it there.

430
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,557
- "They"?
- Mm.

431
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:19,145
And whoever they are,
they appear to be looking out for us.

432
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,189
That wormhole lets us
travel to other stars.

433
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,275
It came along right as we needed it.

434
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,361
They've put potentially habitable worlds
right within our reach.

435
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,447
Twelve, in fact, from our initial probes.

436
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,991
- You sent probes into that?
- Mm-hm.

437
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,161
We sent people into it. Ten years ago.

438
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,164
The Lazarus missions.

439
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,738
Twelve possible worlds...

440
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,209
twelve Ranger launches carrying...

441
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,087
the bravest humans ever to live...

442
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,882
led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

443
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,385
Each person's landing pod
had enough life support for two years.

444
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,512
But they could use hibernation
to stretch that...

445
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,891
making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

446
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:00,895
Their mission was to assess their world,
and if it showed potential...

447
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:05,650
then they could send out a signal, bed
down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.

448
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,860
And what if the world didn't show promise?

449
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,904
Hence the bravery.

450
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,240
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12.

451
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,533
No.

452
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,204
Data transmission back through
the wormhole is rudimentary.

453
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:20,937
Simple binary pings on
an annual basis give us

454
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:23,417
some clue as to which
worlds have potential.

455
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,378
And one system shows promise.

456
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,255
One. That's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?

457
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:31,926
One system with three potential worlds?

458
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,928
No long shot.

459
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,223
Okay.

460
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,267
So if we find a home...

461
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:46,399
- then what?
- That's the long shot.

462
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,944
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

463
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,406
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

464
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:08,045
This entire facility's a centrifuge.

465
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,881
Some kind of vehicle. A space station?

466
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,967
Both. Plan A.

467
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:15,219
How do you get it off the ground?

468
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:19,056
The first gravitational anomalies
changed everything.

469
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:23,728
Suddenly we knew
that harnessing gravity was real.

470
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:28,733
So I started working on a theory
and we started building this station.

471
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,193
But you haven't solved it yet.

472
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,821
That's why there's Plan B.

473
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:39,034
The problem is gravity. How to get a viable
amount of human life off the planet.

474
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,494
This is one way.

475
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,330
Plan B: a population bomb.

476
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:48,419
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

477
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,629
How would you raise them?

478
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,257
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

479
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:57,303
After that, with surrogacy,
the growth becomes exponential.

480
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:01,307
Within 30 years,
we could have a colony of hundreds.

481
00:35:01,475 --> 00:35:04,852
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

482
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,021
This takes care of that.

483
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,648
But what about the people here? You just...

484
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,358
give up on them?

485
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,235
My kids?

486
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:17,114
That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

487
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,244
- How far have you got?
- Almost there.

488
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,830
You're asking me to hang everything...

489
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,208
on an almost.

490
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:30,044
I'm asking you to trust me.

491
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,799
Find us a new home.

492
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,551
And by the time you return...

493
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,805
I will have solved
the problem of gravity.

494
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,349
I give you my word.

495
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,488
Go away!

496
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,208
Murph.

497
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,586
Go! If you're leaving, just go.

498
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:18,217
This world was never enough
for you, was it, Coop?

499
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:22,805
What, because heading out there
is what I feel like I was born to do?

500
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,599
And it excites me? Heh.

501
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,769
No, that does not make it wrong.

502
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,062
It might.

503
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,566
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

504
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,652
The why of the thing,
that's the foundation.

505
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,904
And the foundation's solid.

506
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:47,079
We farmers, we sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say:

507
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,622
"Next year."

508
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,960
Well, next year ain't gonna save us,
nor the one after that.

509
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:57,923
This world's a treasure, Donald, but it's
been telling us to leave for a while now.

510
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,432
Mankind was born on Earth,
it was never meant to die here.

511
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,771
Tom will be all right, but you got
to make things right with Murph.

512
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:13,981
I will.

513
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:18,110
Without making promises
you don't know you can keep.

514
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,748
You have to talk to me, Murph.

515
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,377
I need to fix this before I go.

516
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,422
Then I'll keep it
broken so you have to stay.

517
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:45,012
After you kids came along, your mom said
something to me I never quite understood.

518
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,014
She said, "Now...

519
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:53,395
we're just here
to be memories for our kids."

520
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,028
And I think that now I understand
what she meant.

521
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:08,535
Once you're a parent,
you're the ghost of your children's future.

522
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:12,331
You said ghosts didn't exist.

523
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,297
That's right, Murph.

524
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,843
Murph, look at me.

525
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,391
I can't be your ghost right now.

526
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,186
I need to exist.

527
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,731
They chose me.

528
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:42,403
Murph, they chose me. You saw.
You're the one who led me to them.

529
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,533
That's exactly why you can't go.

530
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,705
I figured out the message.

531
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:56,333
- One word. Know what it is?
- Murph.

532
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,835
"Stay."

533
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:01,088
- It says, "Stay," Dad.
- Murph.

534
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,507
You don't believe me.

535
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,468
Look at the books! Look at this.
It says, "Stay."

536
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,596
Why...? You're not listening!
It says, "Stay!"

537
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,765
No, I'm coming back.

538
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,267
When?

539
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,741
One for you, one for me.

540
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,286
When I'm up there in hypersleep, or...

541
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,164
traveling near the speed of light, or...

542
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,292
near a black hole...

543
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:43,297
time's gonna change for me.
It's gonna run more slowly.

544
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,675
When we get back...

545
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,219
we're gonna compare.

546
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,014
- Time will run differently for us?
- Yeah.

547
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:57,770
By the time I get back,
we might even be the same age, you and me.

548
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,481
"What?" Imagine that!

549
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,195
Aw, Murph...

550
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,989
You have no idea when you're coming back.

551
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:12,284
No idea at all!

552
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,539
Murph, don't... Don't
make me leave like this.

553
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,208
Come on, Murph!

554
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,044
Don't make me leave like this, Murph!

555
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,677
Hey...

556
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:32,554
I love you.

557
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,848
Forever. You hear me?

558
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:38,519
I love you forever, and I'm coming back.

559
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,651
I'm coming back.

560
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,046
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

561
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,257
Just fine.

562
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,848
I love you, Tom.

563
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,517
- Travel safe, huh?
- Yeah.

564
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,936
You look after our place for me, all right?

565
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:22,729
- All right?
- Uh-huh.

566
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,490
Hey, can I use your
truck while you're gone?

567
00:41:29,502 --> 00:41:30,612
You mean your truck?

568
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,740
I'll make sure they bring it back.

569
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,661
Look after my kids, Donald!

570
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:53,760
Go for main engine start. T-minus 10...

571
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:57,931
- Dad! - Nine... Dad!

572
00:41:58,558 --> 00:41:59,600
Eight...

573
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,437
seven... Dad!

574
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,813
Six...

575
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:09,109
five, main engine start, four...

576
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:11,612
three...

577
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,405
two...

578
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:16,408
one. Booster ignition and...

579
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,337
All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.

580
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:35,469
Prepare for stage one separation.

581
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:36,845
Stage one.

582
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,645
There is Mach 1.

583
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:49,316
Everybody good?
Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?

584
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:54,488
They gave him a humor setting
so he'd fit in better with his unit.

585
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,490
He thinks it relaxes us.

586
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:59,451
A giant sarcastic robot.

587
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:01,745
What a great idea!

588
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,623
I have a cue light I can use
when I'm joking if you like.

589
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:05,832
That'd probably help.

590
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,920
You can use it to find your way back to the
ship after I blow you out the airlock.

591
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,007
- What's your humor setting, TARS?
- That's 100 percent.

592
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,968
Let's bring it on down to 75, please.

593
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,136
Stage two separation.

594
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,983
All feeds going manual.

595
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:32,693
Going manual.

596
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:37,155
Deactivate probe heater one, two and three.

597
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,365
Check.

598
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,873
- Taking control.
- This is handover to you.

599
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:53,005
- A.D.F. check.
- Over.

600
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:57,009
Pull thrusters back.
Fuel cells one, two, three.

601
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,510
One hundred percent.

602
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,512
Ex-mites.

603
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,315
It's hard leaving everything.

604
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:14,192
My kids. Your father.

605
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,195
We're going to be spending
a lot of time together.

606
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,407
- We should learn to talk.
- And when not to.

607
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,244
Just being honest.

608
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,747
I don't think you need to be that honest.

609
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,583
Hey, TARS, what's your honesty parameter?

610
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:32,377
- Ninety percent.
- Ninety percent?

611
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:35,589
Absolute honesty isn't always
the most diplomatic, nor the...

612
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:38,342
safest form of communication
with emotional beings.

613
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,968
Okay.

614
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:43,055
Ninety percent it is, Dr. Brand.

615
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:49,978
We are coming up on the Endurance.
Twelve minutes out.

616
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,081
Okay. Taking control.

617
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,420
Approaching module port, 500 meters.

618
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:29,559
It's all you, Doyle.

619
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:50,580
Nice and easy, Doyle. Nice and easy.

620
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,003
I feel good.

621
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,338
Take us home.

622
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:08,473
- Lock.
- Target locked.

623
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:10,475
- Well done.
- Okay, helmets on.

624
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:11,685
Good job.

625
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:46,887
Door's not charging.

626
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,555
Never mind.

627
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,038
Cooper, you should have control.

628
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,873
Control here.

629
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:18,919
Communication with ring module active.

630
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,927
Oh, wow.

631
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:33,892
That's initiate.

632
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:43,944
- Are we ready to spin?
- Just a sec.

633
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,707
- Hello, CASE.
- Hello, TARS.

634
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:00,585
All right, we're all set.

635
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:02,546
All right, let's do it.

636
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,357
Heh.

637
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:32,993
Thirty percent of spin.

638
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,251
One G.

639
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:44,004
How's gravity treating you back there?

640
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,505
Well.

641
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:50,468
Romilly? Hey, you okay?

642
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:51,678
- Yeah.
- You all right?

643
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:53,930
Mm. Yeah, I just need a minute.

644
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:59,019
We have some Dramamine in the hab pod, or
maybe in the cryo-beds. I'll just be a sec.

645
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,354
- Hey, Brand?
- Yeah?

646
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,523
- Bring a lot.
- Heh-heh-heh.

647
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:14,868
Amelia, be safe.

648
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,705
- Give my regards to Dr. Mann.
- I will, Dad.

649
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,790
It looks good for your trajectory.

650
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,294
We've calculated two years to Saturn.

651
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:26,546
That's a lot of Dramamine.

652
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:29,716
Look after my family,
will you, please, sir?

653
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:33,053
We'll be waiting for you when you get back.

654
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:37,390
A little older, a little wiser,
but happy to see you.

655
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,563
Do not go gentle into that good night

656
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:48,276
Old age should burn and
rave at close of day

657
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:54,407
Rage, rage against the dying of the light

658
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:59,079
Though wise men at their end
Know dark is right

659
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,290
Because their words had forked
No lightning they

660
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:06,252
Do not go gentle into that good night

661
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:11,257
Rage, rage against the dying of the light

662
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,526
- You good?
- Yeah.

663
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,945
Okay, thank you.

664
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,783
Here. Pills.

665
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:40,954
So alone.

666
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,415
We have each other. Dr. Mann had it worse.

667
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:44,958
No, I mean them.

668
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:46,251
Hm?

669
00:50:46,419 --> 00:50:49,713
it's a perfect planet,
and we won't find another one like her.

670
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:53,550
No, it's not like looking for a new condo.

671
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,845
The human race is going to be...

672
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:58,388
adrift...

673
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:02,058
desperate for a rock it can cling to
while it catches its breath.

674
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:04,477
We need to find that rock.

675
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:07,522
And our three prospects
are at the edge of what...

676
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,566
might sustain human life.

677
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,527
Laura Miller's planet is first.

678
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:14,821
- Laura started our biology program.
Mm-hm.

679
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:22,996
- Uh, Wolf Edmunds is here.
- Tell me about Edmunds.

680
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:26,583
Oh, uh, Wolf's a particle physicist.

681
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:31,212
None of them had families, huh?

682
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:35,133
No. No attachments. My father insisted.

683
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:38,845
They all knew the odds against
ever seeing another human being again.

684
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,973
I'm hoping we can surprise
at least three of them.

685
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,057
- How about Mann?
- Dr. Mann?

686
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,143
He's remarkable. He's the best of us.

687
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:49,689
He inspired 11 people to follow him
on the loneliest journey in human history.

688
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,441
Scientists, explorers.

689
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:55,695
That's what I love.
You know, out there we face great odds.

690
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:57,614
Death, but...

691
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,700
not evil.

692
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:02,744
You don't think nature can be evil?

693
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,789
No. Formidable. Frightening. But...

694
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:08,583
- no, not evil.
- Hm.

695
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:13,046
Is a lion evil
because it rips a gazelle to shreds?

696
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,548
Just what we take with us, then.

697
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,133
Yeah.

698
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,636
This crew represents the best of humanity.

699
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:20,970
Even me, huh?

700
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,139
You know what? We agreed, 90 percent.

701
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:24,390
There you go.

702
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:27,185
- Don't stay up.
- I'll be there in a minute.

703
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:31,397
Just remember, Coop,
you are literally wasting your breath.

704
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:41,241
Hey, TARS? Let's go over that
trajectory one more time.

705
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,243
Eight months to Mars.

706
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:46,579
Counter-orbital slingshot around.
Fourteen months to Saturn.

707
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:48,164
Nothing's changed on that.

708
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:50,416
Just let me ask you something.

709
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:53,874
Dr. Brand and Edmunds...

710
00:52:53,886 --> 00:52:56,130
Why are you whispering?
They can't hear you.

711
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,593
Dr. Brand and Edmunds. They close?

712
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:02,178
I wouldn't know.

713
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:05,348
Is that 90 percent "wouldn't know"
or 10 percent "wouldn't know"?

714
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:08,643
- I also have a discretion setting, Cooper.
- Aah.

715
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:12,272
But not a poker face, Slick.

716
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:25,869
Hey, guys.

717
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:29,372
Uh, Dad's about to go
down for the long nap.

718
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:32,333
So I wanted to give you an update.

719
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:33,626
Uh...

720
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:37,881
The Earth looks amazing from here. Um...

721
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:41,259
You can't see any of the dust. Heh.

722
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:45,555
Um, I really hope you guys are doing great.

723
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:50,143
I know you'll get this message. Professor
Brand's assured me he'll get it to you.

724
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:52,729
Know that I love you.

725
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,482
- Is it him?
- I don't think so, Murph.

726
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,033
You must be Donald.

727
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,411
Hello, Murph.

728
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:11,164
Why are you in my dad's truck?

729
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,958
He wanted me to bring it for your brother.

730
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,878
He sent you a message.

731
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,966
She's pretty upset with him for leaving.

732
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:26,220
If you record any messages,
I can get them to transmit it to Cooper.

733
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:29,974
Murph is a bright spark.

734
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,519
Maybe I should fan the flame.

735
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,272
She's already making fools of her teachers.

736
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,275
So maybe she should come
and make a fool out of you.

737
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:43,196
- So where are they?
- Heading for Mars.

738
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:47,909
The next time you hear from Cooper,
they'll be coming up on Saturn.

739
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,586
As far as school goes...

740
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:32,912
the administration wants me
to repeat Plant Pathology. Which sucks.

741
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:36,624
But they said I could start
Advanced Agriculture a year early.

742
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:42,296
All right, I got to go, Dad.
Hope you're safe up there.

743
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,927
Um, sorry, Coop.

744
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:52,932
I asked Murph to say hi,
but she's as stubborn as her old man.

745
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,184
I'll try again next time.

746
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,784
You all right, Rom?

747
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,955
This gets to me, Cooper.

748
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,790
This. This.

749
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:21,169
Millimeters of aluminum, that's it,
and then nothing...

750
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:25,298
out there for millions of miles
won't kill us in seconds.

751
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,134
You know that some of the finest...

752
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:32,138
solo yachtsmen in the world
don't know how to swim?

753
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:35,892
They don't know how. And if they
go overboard, psst, they're done.

754
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,604
We're explorers, Rom.

755
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:42,857
This is our boat.

756
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:44,150
Here.

757
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,012
This is from the, uh, relay probe?

758
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,223
It was in orbit around the wormhole.

759
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:18,768
This is the wormhole,
and every time we'd come around...

760
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:22,146
we would receive images
from the other side of the foreign galaxy.

761
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,607
Oh, yeah. Like swinging a periscope around.

762
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:25,858
Exactly.

763
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:30,530
So we got a pretty good idea what we're
gonna find on the other side, huh?

764
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:32,949
Navigationally.

765
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:38,162
Guys? We'll be approaching
the wormhole in about three hours.

766
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:45,586
Hey, Coop?

767
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,214
Can we stop the spinning?

768
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:49,465
Why?

769
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:51,968
Because we're close enough to see it now?

770
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:54,929
All right.

771
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,180
Thanks.

772
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:03,896
There, that's it! That's the wormhole!

773
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:05,857
Say it, don't spray it, Rom.

774
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:07,525
It's a sphere.

775
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:11,654
Of course it is. What, you...?
You thought it would just be a hole?

776
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:15,950
No, it's just that all the illustrations
I've ever seen, they...

777
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,579
In the illustrations,
they're trying to show you how it works.

778
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:24,125
So they say you want to go
from here to there.

779
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:27,003
- But it's too far, right?
- Mm-hm.

780
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:31,966
So a wormhole bends space like this,
so you can take a shortcut through...

781
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:33,885
a higher dimension.

782
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,511
Okay, so...

783
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:38,258
to show that, they've
turned three-dimensional

784
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:39,765
space into two dimensions...

785
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:43,895
which turns a wormhole
into two dimensions, a circle.

786
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:46,314
What's a circle in three dimensions?

787
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,025
- A sphere.
- Exactly.

788
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:50,943
A spherical hole.

789
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:54,322
But who put it there?
Who do we have to thank?

790
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:59,410
I'm not thanking anybody
until we get out of here in one piece, Rom.

791
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:08,044
Any trick to this, Doyle?

792
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,047
No one knows.

793
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,847
The others made it, right?

794
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,559
At least some of them.

795
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:58,678
Everybody ready to say goodbye
to our solar system?

796
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,555
To our galaxy.

797
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:04,517
Here we go.

798
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:40,636
The controls won't work here.
We're passing through the bulk.

799
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:45,224
It's space beyond our three dimensions.
All you can do is record and observe.

800
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:57,445
What is that?

801
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:01,657
I think it's them.

802
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:03,826
Distorting space-time.

803
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:06,996
Don't! Don't!

804
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:36,275
What was that?

805
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:40,780
The first handshake.

806
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:43,491
We're...

807
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,452
We're here.

808
01:02:06,807 --> 01:02:09,058
So the lost communications came through.

809
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:12,103
- How?
- The relay on this side cached them.

810
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:15,815
So years of basic data. No real surprises.

811
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:20,569
Miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up,
as has Dr. Mann's. Um...

812
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,863
Edmunds' went down three years ago.

813
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:24,240
Transmitter failure?

814
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:27,410
Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up
right until it went dark.

815
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,337
But Miller's still looks
good though, right?

816
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:31,789
- Because she's coming up fast.
Mm-hm.

817
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:34,250
With one complication.

818
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:37,670
The planet is much closer to Gargantua
than we thought.

819
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:40,506
- Gargantua?
- It's what we're calling the black hole.

820
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:42,967
Miller's and Dr. Mann's
planets both orbit it.

821
01:02:43,135 --> 01:02:46,345
- And Miller's is on the horizon?
- As a basketball around a hoop.

822
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:48,514
Landing there takes us dangerously close.

823
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:51,934
And a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull.

824
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:57,523
Look, I could swing around that
neutron star to decelerate.

825
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:59,567
No, it's not that. It's time.

826
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:04,238
The gravity on that planet will slow our
clock compared to Earth's drastically.

827
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:06,031
How bad?

828
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:09,743
Every hour we spend on
that planet will be...

829
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,788
seven years back on Earth.

830
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:14,707
Jesus.

831
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,709
Well, that's relativity, folks.

832
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:20,588
Well, we can't just drop down
there without...

833
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,631
Cooper, we have a mission.

834
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,384
Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission,
and our mission Plan A is...

835
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:28,721
to find a planet that can habitate
the people that are living on Earth now.

836
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:31,724
You can't just think about your family.
Now you have to think bigger.

837
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:35,102
I am thinking about my family
and millions of other families, okay?

838
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:39,523
Plan A does not work if the people on Earth
are dead by the time we pull it off.

839
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,485
No. It doesn't.

840
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,487
That's why there's a Plan B.

841
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:47,907
Okay. Cooper's right.

842
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,047
We need to think of time
as a resource, like

843
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:51,911
oxygen and food. Going
down will cost us.

844
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:55,456
All right, look.

845
01:03:56,750 --> 01:04:00,211
Dr. Mann's data is promising,
but it will take months to get there.

846
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:02,588
And Edmunds', it's even further.

847
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:04,829
Miller hasn't sent much,
but what she has is

848
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,926
very promising. it's
water, it's organics...

849
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,261
- You don't find that every day.
- No, you don't.

850
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:11,764
And just think about the resources,
including time...

851
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:14,433
that would be spent
trying to get back here.

852
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,353
- Romilly...
- Yeah?

853
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:21,357
How far off from Miller's planet do we
have to be to stay out of the time shift?

854
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:23,192
Just back from the cusp.

855
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,320
All right, which is here,
just outside of Miller's planet.

856
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:28,280
- Right.
- Okay.

857
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,992
Here's Gargantua. Here's Miller's planet.

858
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,329
Instead of taking the Endurance into orbit
around Miller's planet...

859
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:38,374
which would conserve fuel,
but we would lose a lot of time...

860
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:42,628
what if we take a wider orbit around
Gargantua, parallel with Miller's planet...

861
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:45,297
outside of this time shift, to here?

862
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:48,259
Then we take the Ranger down,
we get Miller, we get her samples.

863
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:51,136
We come back, we analyze, we debrief.
We're in, we're out.

864
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:53,639
We lose a little fuel,
but we save a whole lot of time.

865
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:55,641
- That'll work.
- That's good.

866
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:58,269
There's no time for monkey business
or chit-chat down there.

867
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:01,230
So, TARS, you should definitely stay here.

868
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:03,649
CASE, you're with me. Anyone else can stay.

869
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:07,403
If we're talking about a couple years,
I could use the time to research gravity.

870
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:10,531
Observations from the wormhole,
that's gold to Professor Brand.

871
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:12,379
TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua.

872
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:17,288
Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting, but make
sure we stay in range of Miller's planet.

873
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,999
- You got it?
- I wouldn't leave you behind...

874
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,208
Dr. Brand.

875
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,506
- You ready, CASE?
- Yup.

876
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:31,969
- You don't say much, do you?
- TARS talks plenty for both of us.

877
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,221
Detach.

878
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:44,481
- Romilly, are you reading these forces?
it's unbelievable.

879
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:49,820
A literal heart of darkness.

880
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:56,702
If we could just see
the collapsed star inside...

881
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:59,622
the singularity, yeah,
we'd solve gravity.

882
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:03,334
- And we can't get anything from it?
- Nothing escapes that horizon.

883
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:04,835
Not even light.

884
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:07,180
The answer's there,
just no way to see it.

885
01:06:07,192 --> 01:06:08,505
There's Miller's planet.

886
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:12,509
Goodbye, Ranger.

887
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,608
This is fast for atmospheric entry.

888
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:30,027
- Should we use the thrusters to slow?
- No.

889
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:33,822
I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics
to save some fuel.

890
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,199
Air brake?

891
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:38,911
- We want to get down fast, don't we?
- We want to get there in one piece.

892
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:42,081
- Hang on.
- Brand, Doyle, get ready.

893
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:00,432
- We should ease!
- Hands where I can see them.

894
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,936
The only time I went down was when a
machine was easing at the wrong time.

895
01:07:04,104 --> 01:07:04,981
A little caution...

896
01:07:04,993 --> 01:07:06,939
Can get you killed,
like reckless driving.

897
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:09,274
- Cooper, it's too damn fast!
- I got this.

898
01:07:14,114 --> 01:07:18,117
- Should I disable the feedback?
- No. I need to feel the air.

899
01:07:22,122 --> 01:07:23,288
Here we go.

900
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:27,876
It's just water!

901
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:30,879
The stuff of life.

902
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:32,756
Twelve hundred meters.

903
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:34,967
- Do we have a fix on the beacon?
- Got it!

904
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:37,761
- Can you maneuver?
- I'll need to shave some speed.

905
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:40,556
I'm gonna spiral down on top of it.
Everybody hang on!

906
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:44,017
Seven hundred.

907
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:48,147
On my cue, CASE. On my cue.

908
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:53,152
Five hundred meters.

909
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:03,662
Fire!

910
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:18,302
Very graceful.

911
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:19,553
No.

912
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:22,264
But very efficient.

913
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:26,935
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

914
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,021
Go, go, go!

915
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,691
Seven years per hour here.
Let's make it count!

916
01:08:58,802 --> 01:09:00,052
This way.

917
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:04,640
About 200 meters.

918
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,776
The gravity's punishing.

919
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:18,862
Been floating through space too long?

920
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:21,073
One hundred and thirty percent
Earth gravity.

921
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,408
Come on. Come on.

922
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:28,872
- There's nothing here.
- Should be right here.

923
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:33,794
If the signal's coming from here, then...

924
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,596
Her beacon.

925
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:53,772
Wreckage.

926
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,607
Where's the rest?

927
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:57,609
Towards the mountains!

928
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,282
Those aren't mountains.

929
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,285
They're waves.

930
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:14,293
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

931
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:16,795
That one's moving away from us.

932
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:24,970
We need the recorder.

933
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:37,399
Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!

934
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,944
We're not leaving without her data.

935
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:42,446
Get back here now!

936
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:44,323
We do not have time!

937
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,950
The second wave is coming!
We're in the middle of a swell.

938
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,661
No, I got it.

939
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:51,830
Get your ass back to the Ranger now!

940
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:58,879
Brand, get back here now!

941
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,050
No, Cooper, go. Cooper, go.
I can't make it.

942
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:05,844
- Go!
- CASE, go get her.

943
01:11:10,642 --> 01:11:12,643
- Go!
- Get up. Get up, Brand!

944
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:15,062
Go, go! Go!

945
01:11:16,648 --> 01:11:19,483
- I'm not gonna make it!
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are!

946
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:28,617
Come on, CASE has her!
Get back here, Doyle!

947
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:32,704
Come on!

948
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:36,875
Get to the hatch!

949
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:42,923
Go, go! Go!

950
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:49,554
Shit.

951
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:51,890
Manually overriding inside hatch!

952
01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:56,561
Cooper! Wait!

953
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:07,572
The engines are flooded!
I'm gonna have to shut her down.

954
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:42,357
Holy shit.

955
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,113
Hang on!

956
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:20,604
CASE, what's the problem?

957
01:13:20,772 --> 01:13:23,190
Too waterlogged. Let it drain.

958
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:25,525
Goddamn it!

959
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:30,363
- I told you to leave me! Why didn't you?
- And I told you to get your ass back here!

960
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:35,202
- One of us was thinking about the mission!
- You were thinking about getting home.

961
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:39,372
I was trying to do the right thing!

962
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,500
Can you tell that to Doyle?

963
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:45,962
- CASE, how much time?
- Forty-five to an hour.

964
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:49,091
The stuff of life, huh?

965
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:52,177
What's this gonna cost us, Brand?

966
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:54,304
A lot. Decades.

967
01:14:01,521 --> 01:14:02,854
What happened to Miller?

968
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:06,358
Judging by the wreckage, she was...

969
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:09,152
broken up by a wave soon after impact.

970
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,155
How's the wreckage stayed together
after all these years, huh?

971
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,408
Because of the time slippage.

972
01:14:16,536 --> 01:14:21,039
On this planet's time,
she just landed hours ago.

973
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:24,334
She probably just died minutes ago.

974
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:28,547
The data Doyle received was just
the initial status echoing endlessly.

975
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:31,091
Oh, we are not prepared for this.

976
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,930
You eggheads have the survival skills
of a Boy Scout troop.

977
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:40,350
Well, we got this far on our brains.
Farther than any human in history.

978
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:42,102
Well, not far enough!

979
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:45,939
And now we're stuck here till there
won't be anyone left on Earth to save.

980
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:51,653
I'm counting every minute,
same as you, Cooper.

981
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,285
Is there any possibility...

982
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:02,080
some kind of a way
we can maybe all jump in a black hole?

983
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:03,915
Gain back the years?

984
01:15:04,584 --> 01:15:06,084
Don't shake your head at me.

985
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,253
Time is relative, okay?

986
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:11,464
It can stretch and it can squeeze, but...

987
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:14,176
it can't run backwards. it just can't.

988
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:18,763
The only thing that can move across
dimensions, like time, is gravity.

989
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:22,642
Okay.

990
01:15:24,604 --> 01:15:28,481
The beings that led us here,
they communicate...

991
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:30,483
- through gravity, right?
- Yes.

992
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:32,819
Could they be talking
to us from the future?

993
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:35,989
- Maybe.
- Okay. If they can...

994
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:40,452
"They" are beings of five dimensions.

995
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:44,206
To them, time might be
another physical dimension.

996
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,874
To them...

997
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:50,462
the past might be a canyon
that they can climb into and the future...

998
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:53,632
a mountain they can climb up.
But to us, it's not, okay?

999
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:57,135
Look, Cooper, I screwed up. I'm sorry.

1000
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:01,056
But you knew about relativity.

1001
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:02,557
Oh.

1002
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:05,435
Brand...

1003
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:12,234
My daughter was 10 years old.

1004
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,654
I couldn't teach her
Einstein's theories before I left.

1005
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:18,907
Couldn't you have told her
you were going to save the world?

1006
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:20,533
No.

1007
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:26,373
When you become a parent,
one thing becomes really clear.

1008
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:31,044
And that is that you want to make sure
your children feel safe.

1009
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:35,840
And it rules out telling a 10-year-old
that the world is ending.

1010
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:39,678
Cooper?

1011
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:45,892
- How long for the engines, CASE?
- A minute or two.

1012
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,144
We don't have it. Helmets on!

1013
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:53,858
Brand, co-pilot, you're up.

1014
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:56,528
CASE, blow the cabin oxygen
through the main thrusters!

1015
01:16:56,696 --> 01:16:58,405
- We're gonna spark it.
- Roger that.

1016
01:16:58,698 --> 01:17:00,031
- Locked.
- Depressurizing.

1017
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:07,163
Engines up!

1018
01:17:36,027 --> 01:17:37,527
Hello, Rom.

1019
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:39,654
I've waited years.

1020
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,574
How...? How many years?

1021
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:47,370
- By now it must be...
Twenty-three years...

1022
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:49,247
four months, eight days.

1023
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:54,836
Doyle?

1024
01:18:01,052 --> 01:18:04,054
I thought I was prepared.
I knew the theory.

1025
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:06,931
Reality's different.

1026
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:09,142
And Miller?

1027
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:12,729
There's nothing here for us.

1028
01:18:15,483 --> 01:18:16,983
Why didn't you sleep?

1029
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:22,030
Oh, I had a couple of stretches. But I
stopped believing you were coming back.

1030
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:25,533
And something seemed wrong
about dreaming my life away.

1031
01:18:26,369 --> 01:18:29,204
I learned what I could
from the black hole...

1032
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:32,040
but I couldn't send
anything to your father.

1033
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,459
We've been receiving, but nothing gets out.

1034
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:36,711
- Is he alive?
- Oh, yeah.

1035
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:38,922
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1036
01:18:41,926 --> 01:18:44,928
We've got years of messages stored.

1037
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:46,388
Cooper.

1038
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:49,557
Messages span 23 years.

1039
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:53,269
Play it from the beginning.

1040
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:58,024
Hey, Dad.

1041
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:01,277
Checking in. Saying hi.

1042
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:05,824
Um... Finished second in school.

1043
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,828
Miss Kurling's still giving me C's though.

1044
01:19:10,121 --> 01:19:12,956
Pulled me down, but second's not bad.

1045
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:16,292
Grandpa attended the ceremony.

1046
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,921
Um... Oh.

1047
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:22,841
I met another girl, Dad.

1048
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:24,592
I, uh...

1049
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:27,345
I really think this is the one.

1050
01:19:28,639 --> 01:19:31,224
Name's Lois. That's her right there.

1051
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,271
Murphy stole Grandpa's car.

1052
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:39,607
She crashed it. She's okay, though.

1053
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:41,359
Hey, Dad.

1054
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:43,611
Look at this!

1055
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:45,947
You're a grandpa.

1056
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:49,033
His name's Jesse.

1057
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:54,289
I kind of wanted to call him Coop,
but Lois says, uh, maybe next time.

1058
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:59,377
Donald says he's already earned the "great"
part, so we just leave it at that.

1059
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:04,340
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

1060
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:06,759
Say "Bye-bye, Grandpa."

1061
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:08,970
Bye-bye, Grandpa. Okay.

1062
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:11,890
Sorry it's been a while.

1063
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:14,309
Just...

1064
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,521
what with Jesse and all.

1065
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:23,401
Uh...

1066
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:27,363
Grandpa died last week.

1067
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:30,867
We buried him out in the back forty
next to Mom and...

1068
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,827
Jesse.

1069
01:20:33,704 --> 01:20:36,789
Which is where we would have buried you
if you'd ever...

1070
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,042
come back.

1071
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:42,795
Murph was there at the funeral.

1072
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:46,174
We don't see her that much,
but she came for that.

1073
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:51,804
You aren't listening to this, I know that.

1074
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:57,685
All these messages are just, like...

1075
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:02,524
drifting out there in the darkness.

1076
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:05,944
Lois says that, uh...

1077
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:09,489
I have to let you go.

1078
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,699
And, uh...

1079
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:13,284
so...

1080
01:21:16,539 --> 01:21:19,624
I guess I'm letting you go.

1081
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:23,253
I don't know where you are, Dad...

1082
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:26,506
but I hope that you're at peace.

1083
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,384
Goodbye.

1084
01:21:42,982 --> 01:21:44,232
Hey, Dad.

1085
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:48,236
Hey, Murph.

1086
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:50,321
You son of a bitch.

1087
01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:56,536
I never made one of these
when you were still responding...

1088
01:21:56,704 --> 01:21:59,038
because I was so mad at you for leaving.

1089
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:04,168
And then when you went quiet, it...

1090
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:09,632
seemed like I should live
with that decision. And I have.

1091
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:16,556
But today's my birthday.

1092
01:22:20,227 --> 01:22:23,396
And it's a special one,
because you told me...

1093
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:31,863
You once told me that when you came back,
we might be the same age.

1094
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:36,659
And today I'm the age you were
when you left.

1095
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:41,748
So it would be a real good time
for you to come back.

1096
01:22:56,221 --> 01:23:00,516
I didn't mean to intrude. It's just that
I've never seen you in here before.

1097
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:03,311
I've never been in here before.

1098
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:08,191
I talk to Amelia all the time.

1099
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:10,026
It helps.

1100
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:13,446
- I'm glad you've started.
- I haven't. I...

1101
01:23:13,614 --> 01:23:16,115
I just had something I needed to get out.

1102
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:18,868
- I know they're still out there.
- I know.

1103
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:20,719
There are so many reasons their

1104
01:23:20,731 --> 01:23:23,247
communications might not
be getting through.

1105
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:24,832
I know, professor.

1106
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:28,378
I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of.

1107
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:31,881
Them never coming back or...

1108
01:23:33,092 --> 01:23:36,302
coming back to find we've failed.

1109
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:37,887
Then let's succeed.

1110
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:39,972
So...

1111
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:44,686
back to the fourth iteration.
Let's run it through some new fields.

1112
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:48,189
With respect, professor,
we've tried that hundreds of times.

1113
01:23:48,524 --> 01:23:52,193
It only has to work once, Murph.

1114
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:59,367
Every rivet that they strike
could have been a bullet.

1115
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:01,536
We've done well for the world here...

1116
01:24:01,704 --> 01:24:06,457
whether or not we crack the equation
before I kick the bucket.

1117
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:09,502
- Don't be morbid, professor.
- I'm not afraid of death.

1118
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:12,088
I'm an old physicist.

1119
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:15,007
I'm afraid of time.

1120
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:23,349
Time.

1121
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:27,061
You're afraid of time.

1122
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:31,649
We've been trying to solve the equation...

1123
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:34,318
without changing
the underlying assumption about time.

1124
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:36,195
- And?
- And that means...

1125
01:24:36,363 --> 01:24:40,825
each iteration is an attempt
to prove its own proof.

1126
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:43,119
It's recursive. It's nonsensical.

1127
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:45,329
Are you calling my life's work...

1128
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:47,206
nonsense, Murph?

1129
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:49,417
No, I'm saying that
you've been trying to...

1130
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:53,379
finish it with one arm... No, with
both arms... tied behind your back.

1131
01:24:55,466 --> 01:24:57,467
And I don't understand why.

1132
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:00,261
I'm an old man, Murph.

1133
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:03,806
Can we take this point up at another time?

1134
01:25:03,974 --> 01:25:06,100
I want to talk to my daughter.

1135
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:10,730
Stepping out into the universe...

1136
01:25:10,898 --> 01:25:14,692
we must confront the reality
of interstellar travel.

1137
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:20,156
We must reach far beyond
our own lifespans.

1138
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:25,453
We must think not as individuals
but as a species.

1139
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:30,917
Do not go gentle into that good night

1140
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:35,671
TARS kept the Endurance
right where we needed her.

1141
01:25:35,839 --> 01:25:38,633
But the trip took years longer
than we anticipated.

1142
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:42,470
We no longer have the fuel
to visit both prospects, so...

1143
01:25:42,805 --> 01:25:44,305
we have to choose.

1144
01:25:45,516 --> 01:25:46,641
But how?

1145
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:49,352
They're both promising.

1146
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:55,399
Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann
is the one still transmitting, so...

1147
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:58,486
We've no reason to suspect
Edmunds's data would have soured.

1148
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:01,906
His world has key elements
to sustain human life.

1149
01:26:02,074 --> 01:26:05,243
- As does Dr. Mann's.
- Cooper, this is my field.

1150
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:07,453
And...

1151
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:10,414
I really believe Edmunds'
is the better prospect.

1152
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:13,918
- Why?
- Gargantua, that's why.

1153
01:26:15,045 --> 01:26:19,090
Look at Miller's planet.
Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...

1154
01:26:19,258 --> 01:26:23,678
but no life. Sterile.
We'll find the same thing on Mann's.

1155
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:25,763
Because of the black hole?

1156
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:29,100
Murphy's Law.
Whatever can happen will happen.

1157
01:26:29,268 --> 01:26:31,602
Accident is the first building block
of evolution.

1158
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:34,605
But when you're orbiting a black hole
not enough can happen.

1159
01:26:34,773 --> 01:26:39,068
It sucks in asteroids and comets, other
events which would otherwise reach you.

1160
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:41,279
We need to go further afield.

1161
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:44,240
You once said that Dr. Mann...

1162
01:26:45,492 --> 01:26:46,993
was the best of us.

1163
01:26:47,286 --> 01:26:50,454
He's remarkable.
We're only here because of him.

1164
01:26:50,998 --> 01:26:52,832
And yet... Yet here he is.

1165
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,962
He's on the ground, and he's sending
a very unambiguous message, telling us...

1166
01:26:58,130 --> 01:26:59,839
to come to his planet.

1167
01:27:00,007 --> 01:27:04,635
Granted, but Edmunds' data
is more promising.

1168
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:06,137
We should vote.

1169
01:27:06,305 --> 01:27:08,472
Well, if we vote,
there's something you should know.

1170
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:10,641
Brand?

1171
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:12,476
He has a right to know.

1172
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:14,729
That has nothing to do with it.

1173
01:27:14,897 --> 01:27:17,940
- What does?
- She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.

1174
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:20,651
- Is that true?
- Yes.

1175
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:26,532
And that makes me want to follow my heart.

1176
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:33,664
But maybe we've spent too long
trying to figure all this out with theory.

1177
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:35,249
You're a scientist, Brand.

1178
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:36,959
So listen to me...

1179
01:27:37,794 --> 01:27:42,506
when I say that love
isn't something we invented. It's...

1180
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:45,843
observable, powerful.

1181
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:49,639
It has to mean something.

1182
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:54,185
Love has meaning, yes. Social utility,
social bonding, child rearing...

1183
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:57,855
We love people who have died.
Where's the social utility in that?

1184
01:27:58,398 --> 01:27:59,440
None.

1185
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:03,486
Maybe it means something more,
something we can't...

1186
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:05,696
yet understand.

1187
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:09,325
Maybe it's some evidence, some...

1188
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:14,747
artifact of a higher dimension
that we can't consciously perceive.

1189
01:28:14,915 --> 01:28:19,710
I'm drawn across the universe
to someone I haven't seen in a decade...

1190
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:22,713
who I know is probably dead.

1191
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:26,384
Love is the one thing
we're capable of perceiving...

1192
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:29,387
that transcends dimensions
of time and space.

1193
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:35,559
Maybe we should trust that,
even if we can't understand it yet.

1194
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:42,233
All right, Cooper...

1195
01:28:44,111 --> 01:28:45,403
yes...

1196
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:49,907
the tiniest possibility
of seeing Wolf again excites me.

1197
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:52,410
That doesn't mean I'm wrong.

1198
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,287
Honestly, Amelia...

1199
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:58,249
it might.

1200
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:07,758
TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's.

1201
01:29:24,651 --> 01:29:26,110
We'll lose about a third again.

1202
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:27,820
But next year...

1203
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:32,950
Next year I'm gonna work Nelson's farm
and we'll make it up.

1204
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:35,619
What happened to Nelson?

1205
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:43,753
Murph, would you like some more soufflé?

1206
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,298
Oh, no. I'm full, thanks. It was delicious.

1207
01:29:48,175 --> 01:29:50,176
Coop, finish your fritter, please.

1208
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:56,057
Will you spend the night? Your room is
exactly as you left it. it's ready.

1209
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,600
I need to get back.

1210
01:29:57,768 --> 01:30:00,311
My sewing machine is in there,
but there's plenty...

1211
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:01,771
I need to...

1212
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:06,192
Too many memories.

1213
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:09,612
We might have something for that.
Hey, Coop.

1214
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:18,454
The dust.

1215
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:23,334
Lois, I have a friend who...

1216
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:25,336
could look at his lungs.

1217
01:30:43,522 --> 01:30:46,190
- Amelia, I'm sorry.
- You were just being objective.

1218
01:30:46,358 --> 01:30:49,819
Unless you're punishing me
for screwing up on Miller's planet.

1219
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:52,238
No, this wasn't a personal decision.

1220
01:30:53,073 --> 01:30:57,118
If you're wrong, you will have
a very personal decision to make.

1221
01:30:57,285 --> 01:31:00,246
Your fuel calculations
are based on a return journey.

1222
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:04,458
Strike out on Mann's planet, and we'll have
to decide whether to return home...

1223
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:06,877
or push on to Edmunds' with Plan B.

1224
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:10,881
Starting a colony could save us
from extinction.

1225
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:14,385
You might have to decide
between seeing your children again...

1226
01:31:14,553 --> 01:31:16,387
and the future of the human race.

1227
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:19,598
I trust you'll be as objective then.

1228
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:28,399
He's been asking for you since he came to.

1229
01:31:28,567 --> 01:31:30,192
We were trying to reach you.

1230
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:37,199
Murph.

1231
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:39,702
I'm here, professor.

1232
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:42,746
I let you all down.

1233
01:31:43,081 --> 01:31:46,417
No, you got us so far. Real close.

1234
01:31:48,253 --> 01:31:50,045
I'll finish what you started.

1235
01:31:50,213 --> 01:31:52,423
Good, good Murph.

1236
01:31:54,718 --> 01:31:57,011
You had faith...

1237
01:31:58,221 --> 01:31:59,513
all those...

1238
01:32:00,473 --> 01:32:02,266
all those years.

1239
01:32:03,935 --> 01:32:07,855
I... I asked you to have faith.

1240
01:32:09,608 --> 01:32:12,401
I wanted you to believe...

1241
01:32:13,904 --> 01:32:15,779
that your father...

1242
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:20,618
would come back.

1243
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:22,077
I do, professor.

1244
01:32:23,705 --> 01:32:25,206
Forgive me, Murph.

1245
01:32:25,957 --> 01:32:27,958
There's nothing to forgive.

1246
01:32:30,629 --> 01:32:31,670
I...

1247
01:32:32,255 --> 01:32:34,089
I lied, Murph.

1248
01:32:36,468 --> 01:32:38,260
I lied to you.

1249
01:32:44,601 --> 01:32:47,811
There was no need for him to...

1250
01:32:49,022 --> 01:32:50,898
To come back.

1251
01:32:53,485 --> 01:32:56,820
There is no way to help us.

1252
01:32:58,114 --> 01:32:59,156
But Plan A...

1253
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:02,826
All this. All these people.

1254
01:33:03,954 --> 01:33:05,746
And the equation.

1255
01:33:09,751 --> 01:33:11,502
Did my father know?

1256
01:33:15,298 --> 01:33:17,007
Did he leave me?

1257
01:33:20,971 --> 01:33:22,012
Do...

1258
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:24,515
not...

1259
01:33:25,475 --> 01:33:26,725
go...

1260
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:29,520
gentle...

1261
01:33:31,523 --> 01:33:32,690
No.

1262
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:35,442
No!

1263
01:33:36,653 --> 01:33:38,320
You can't leave.

1264
01:33:38,697 --> 01:33:39,947
You... No.

1265
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:45,703
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you that
your father died today. He had no pain.

1266
01:33:46,288 --> 01:33:47,955
He was at peace.

1267
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:50,708
I'm very sorry for your loss.

1268
01:34:03,305 --> 01:34:04,972
Brand, did you know?

1269
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:09,059
He told you, right?

1270
01:34:11,938 --> 01:34:13,314
You knew.

1271
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:17,026
This was all a sham.

1272
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:23,490
You left us here.

1273
01:34:25,243 --> 01:34:26,744
To suffocate.

1274
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:30,247
To starve.

1275
01:34:57,609 --> 01:34:58,942
Frozen cloud.

1276
01:37:23,379 --> 01:37:24,755
It's okay.

1277
01:37:24,923 --> 01:37:26,340
It's okay.

1278
01:37:33,181 --> 01:37:34,681
It's okay.

1279
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:42,105
Pray you never learn...

1280
01:37:43,274 --> 01:37:46,610
just how good it can be
to see another face.

1281
01:37:55,036 --> 01:37:57,538
I hadn't a lot of hope
to begin with, but...

1282
01:37:57,705 --> 01:38:00,040
after so long, I had none.

1283
01:38:01,709 --> 01:38:04,545
My supplies were completely exhausted.

1284
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:10,259
The last time I went to sleep,
I didn't even set a waking date.

1285
01:38:13,972 --> 01:38:16,557
You have literally raised me from the dead.

1286
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,768
- Lazarus.
- Hm.

1287
01:38:20,687 --> 01:38:23,939
- What about the others?
- I'm afraid you're it, sir.

1288
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:27,067
So far, surely.

1289
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:32,656
No, our present situation is that there's
very little chance of rescuing any others.

1290
01:38:36,411 --> 01:38:38,620
Dr. Mann. Dr. Mann?

1291
01:38:39,497 --> 01:38:41,290
Tell us about your world.

1292
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:46,545
Our world, we hope.

1293
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:54,136
Our world, uh, is cold...
stark...

1294
01:38:56,014 --> 01:38:57,848
but undeniably beautiful.

1295
01:39:00,101 --> 01:39:03,353
The days are 67 hours long, cold.

1296
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:11,612
The nights are... 67
far colder hours.

1297
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:21,788
The gravity is a very, very pleasant
80 percent of the Earth's.

1298
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:24,958
Now, up here where I landed,
the water is alkali...

1299
01:39:25,293 --> 01:39:29,046
and the air has too much ammonia to
breathe for more than just a few minutes...

1300
01:39:29,213 --> 01:39:33,800
but down at the surface,
and there is a surface...

1301
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:35,594
the chlorine dissipates.

1302
01:39:35,762 --> 01:39:39,640
The ammonia gives way to crystalline
hydrocarbons and breathable air.

1303
01:39:39,974 --> 01:39:41,475
To organics.

1304
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:44,144
Possibly even to life.

1305
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:46,897
We might be sharing this world.

1306
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,399
These readings are from the surface?

1307
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:52,736
Over the years, I've
dropped various probes.

1308
01:39:53,071 --> 01:39:56,490
- How far have you explored?
- I've mounted several major expeditions.

1309
01:39:56,658 --> 01:40:00,911
But with oxygen in limited supply,
KIPP there really did most of the legwork.

1310
01:40:01,079 --> 01:40:03,538
- What went wrong with him, sir?
- Degeneration.

1311
01:40:03,706 --> 01:40:07,292
He misidentified the first organics
we found as ammonia crystals.

1312
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:11,588
We struggled on for a time,
but ultimately I decommissioned him and...

1313
01:40:11,756 --> 01:40:13,924
used his power source
to keep the mission going.

1314
01:40:14,092 --> 01:40:17,094
I thought I was alone
before I shut him down.

1315
01:40:17,261 --> 01:40:18,929
Would you like me to look at him?

1316
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:21,598
No. No. He needs a human touch.

1317
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:26,269
Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message
for you from the comm station.

1318
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:28,897
Okay. Be right there. Excuse me.

1319
01:40:40,910 --> 01:40:43,495
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

1320
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:45,831
He had no pain.

1321
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,460
He was at peace.

1322
01:40:52,547 --> 01:40:54,381
I'm sorry for your loss.

1323
01:40:56,759 --> 01:40:57,801
Is that Murph?

1324
01:40:58,511 --> 01:41:00,971
She's... She's grown.

1325
01:41:01,139 --> 01:41:02,723
Brand, did you know?

1326
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:05,559
He told you, right?

1327
01:41:08,604 --> 01:41:09,896
You knew.

1328
01:41:11,649 --> 01:41:13,150
This was all a sham.

1329
01:41:14,193 --> 01:41:15,861
You left us here.

1330
01:41:17,989 --> 01:41:19,489
To suffocate.

1331
01:41:21,576 --> 01:41:22,951
To starve.

1332
01:41:26,289 --> 01:41:27,873
Did my father know too?

1333
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:31,918
Dad?

1334
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:35,589
I just want to know...

1335
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:38,925
if you left me here to die.

1336
01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:43,513
I just have to know.

1337
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:50,437
Cooper, my...

1338
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:53,857
My father dedicated...

1339
01:41:54,233 --> 01:41:59,237
his whole life to Plan A.
I have no idea what she's talking about.

1340
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:02,115
I do.

1341
01:42:07,246 --> 01:42:09,915
He never even hoped
to get the people off the Earth?

1342
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:12,334
No.

1343
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:20,217
But he's been trying to solve
the gravity equation for 40 years.

1344
01:42:20,718 --> 01:42:24,137
Amelia, your father solved his equation
before I even left.

1345
01:42:24,722 --> 01:42:26,598
Then why wouldn't he use it?

1346
01:42:26,766 --> 01:42:30,727
The equation couldn't reconcile relativity
with quantum mechanics. You need more.

1347
01:42:30,895 --> 01:42:32,813
More? More what?

1348
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:35,982
More data. You need
to see into a black hole.

1349
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:38,235
The laws of nature prohibit
a naked singularity.

1350
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:39,903
Romilly, is that true?

1351
01:42:41,197 --> 01:42:44,908
If a black hole is an oyster,
then the singularity's the pearl inside.

1352
01:42:45,076 --> 01:42:47,828
The gravity's so strong,
it's always hidden in darkness...

1353
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:49,412
behind the horizon.

1354
01:42:50,832 --> 01:42:52,916
That's why we call it a black hole.

1355
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:56,503
Okay, but if we see beyond the horizon...

1356
01:42:57,088 --> 01:42:58,588
We can't, Coop.

1357
01:42:58,756 --> 01:43:01,258
There are some things
that aren't meant to be known.

1358
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:05,637
Your father had to find another way
to save the human race from extinction.

1359
01:43:05,805 --> 01:43:07,305
Plan B. A colony.

1360
01:43:07,473 --> 01:43:09,140
Why not tell people?

1361
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:13,812
- Why keep building those stations?
- He knew how hard it would be...

1362
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:18,108
to get people to work together
to save the species instead of themselves.

1363
01:43:18,276 --> 01:43:19,442
Or their children.

1364
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:20,652
Bullshit.

1365
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:23,613
You never would've come
unless you believed you would save them.

1366
01:43:23,781 --> 01:43:26,992
Evolution has yet to transcend
that simple barrier.

1367
01:43:27,159 --> 01:43:29,619
We can care deeply, selflessly about...

1368
01:43:29,787 --> 01:43:33,290
those we know, but that empathy
rarely extends beyond our line of sight.

1369
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:35,166
But the lie.

1370
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:40,881
That monstrous lie?

1371
01:43:42,133 --> 01:43:43,425
Unforgivable.

1372
01:43:43,593 --> 01:43:45,051
And he knew that.

1373
01:43:45,803 --> 01:43:50,140
He was prepared to destroy his own humanity
in order to save the species.

1374
01:43:50,308 --> 01:43:52,726
- He made an incredible sacrifice.
- No.

1375
01:43:54,145 --> 01:43:59,024
An incredible sacrifice is being made
by the people on Earth who are gonna die!

1376
01:43:59,483 --> 01:44:01,651
Because in his fucking arrogance...

1377
01:44:02,069 --> 01:44:04,154
he declared their case hopeless.

1378
01:44:04,822 --> 01:44:06,323
I'm sorry, Cooper...

1379
01:44:06,866 --> 01:44:08,325
their case is hopeless.

1380
01:44:08,492 --> 01:44:10,619
No. No.

1381
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:12,746
We are the future.

1382
01:44:16,417 --> 01:44:18,335
Cooper, what can I do?

1383
01:44:21,547 --> 01:44:23,381
Let me go home.

1384
01:44:23,966 --> 01:44:25,884
You're absolutely positive?

1385
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:29,012
His solution was correct.
He'd had it for years.

1386
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:32,307
- It's worthless?
- It's half the answer.

1387
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:36,269
Okay, how do you find the other half?

1388
01:44:36,854 --> 01:44:38,521
Out there? A black hole.

1389
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:41,524
- But stuck down here on Earth?
- Yeah?

1390
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:44,527
I'm not sure you can.

1391
01:44:46,447 --> 01:44:49,115
God, they just pack up and leave.

1392
01:44:50,534 --> 01:44:52,619
What are they hoping to find?

1393
01:44:53,204 --> 01:44:54,245
Survival.

1394
01:45:02,046 --> 01:45:03,129
Damn it.

1395
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:09,844
Murph, don't...?
Don't people have a right to know?

1396
01:45:10,471 --> 01:45:14,557
Panic won't help.
We just have to keep working, same as ever.

1397
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:18,061
But isn't that exactly what Professor Brand
was manipulating us to do?

1398
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:21,481
Brand gave up on us.
I'm still trying to solve this.

1399
01:45:22,108 --> 01:45:23,191
So...

1400
01:45:24,610 --> 01:45:26,277
do you have an idea?

1401
01:45:26,988 --> 01:45:28,321
A feeling.

1402
01:45:31,742 --> 01:45:33,743
I told you about my ghost.

1403
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:37,789
My dad thought I called it a ghost...

1404
01:45:38,249 --> 01:45:39,916
because I was scared of it.

1405
01:45:43,379 --> 01:45:44,713
But I was never scared of it.

1406
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:49,592
I called it a ghost because it felt...

1407
01:45:52,013 --> 01:45:53,680
It felt like a person.

1408
01:45:56,225 --> 01:45:57,892
It was trying to tell me something.

1409
01:46:00,855 --> 01:46:03,857
If there's an answer here on Earth,
it's back there...

1410
01:46:04,316 --> 01:46:06,234
somehow, in that room.

1411
01:46:06,777 --> 01:46:08,528
So I have to find it.

1412
01:46:11,949 --> 01:46:13,700
We're running out of time.

1413
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:17,620
What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?

1414
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:19,956
No, they can stay.
I'll be sleeping anyway.

1415
01:46:20,124 --> 01:46:21,708
- Hey, Coop?
- Yeah?

1416
01:46:21,876 --> 01:46:23,877
I have a suggestion for
your return journey.

1417
01:46:24,045 --> 01:46:26,796
- Yeah, what's that?
- Have one last crack at the black hole.

1418
01:46:28,674 --> 01:46:30,258
I'm going home, Rom.

1419
01:46:30,426 --> 01:46:33,678
Yeah, I know.
This isn't going to cost you any time.

1420
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:36,264
There's a chance for the people on Earth.

1421
01:46:37,016 --> 01:46:40,060
- Talk to me.
- Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.

1422
01:46:40,227 --> 01:46:44,105
- It's what we call a gentle singularity.
- Gentle?

1423
01:46:44,273 --> 01:46:47,734
They're hardly gentle.
But the tidal gravity is so quick that...

1424
01:46:47,902 --> 01:46:52,155
something crossing the horizon fast
might survive. A probe, say.

1425
01:46:52,323 --> 01:46:56,993
- What happens after it crosses?
- After the horizon is a complete mystery.

1426
01:46:57,161 --> 01:47:00,246
So, what's to say
there isn't some way that the probe...

1427
01:47:00,414 --> 01:47:03,333
can glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

1428
01:47:03,501 --> 01:47:06,753
If he's equipped to transmit
every form of energy that can pulse.

1429
01:47:06,921 --> 01:47:09,714
Just when did this probe
become a "he," professor?

1430
01:47:10,257 --> 01:47:12,008
TARS is the obvious candidate.

1431
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:14,761
I've already told him what to look for.

1432
01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:17,639
I'd need the old optical transmitter
off KIPP, Cooper.

1433
01:47:17,807 --> 01:47:19,140
You'd do this for us?

1434
01:47:19,308 --> 01:47:23,228
Before you get all teary, remember that
as a robot I have to do anything you say.

1435
01:47:24,146 --> 01:47:25,605
Your cue light's broken.

1436
01:47:25,773 --> 01:47:27,315
I'm not joking.

1437
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:33,196
I'll need TARS to remove and adapt
some components from KIPP.

1438
01:47:33,364 --> 01:47:35,698
I don't want to disturb
his archival functions.

1439
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:37,367
I'll supervise.

1440
01:47:37,701 --> 01:47:38,743
All right.

1441
01:47:38,911 --> 01:47:41,067
Dr. Mann, we need to
find three secure

1442
01:47:41,079 --> 01:47:43,581
sites. One for Brand's
lab, two for habitat.

1443
01:47:43,749 --> 01:47:46,209
Once those modules have landed,
you don't want to move them.

1444
01:47:46,377 --> 01:47:48,920
I can take you to the probe sites,
but I don't think...

1445
01:47:49,088 --> 01:47:51,798
these conditions will hold.
I think we should wait.

1446
01:47:51,966 --> 01:47:54,801
CASE is headed down
with the rest of the distillery equipment.

1447
01:47:54,969 --> 01:47:57,804
I'd really like to secure
those sites by nightfall.

1448
01:47:59,723 --> 01:48:02,809
Well, these squalls do usually blow over.

1449
01:48:03,227 --> 01:48:04,352
Okay, then.

1450
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:06,729
- You'll need a long-range transmitter.
- Got it.

1451
01:48:06,897 --> 01:48:08,439
- Are you charged?
- Yeah.

1452
01:48:09,024 --> 01:48:10,066
Follow me.

1453
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:13,027
TARS, 72 hours, yeah?

1454
01:48:13,195 --> 01:48:14,404
Roger that, Cooper.

1455
01:48:20,703 --> 01:48:23,746
Brand told me why you feel
you have to go back.

1456
01:48:25,583 --> 01:48:28,334
But I'd be remiss
if I didn't at least mention...

1457
01:48:28,669 --> 01:48:32,839
that a mission such as ours
could certainly use an extra engineer.

1458
01:48:34,675 --> 01:48:38,928
You better slow down, turbo.
Safety first, CASE, remember.

1459
01:48:39,555 --> 01:48:41,306
Safety first, Cooper.

1460
01:48:42,558 --> 01:48:45,560
I have to tell you, Dr. Mann,
I'm honored to be a part of this.

1461
01:48:45,936 --> 01:48:50,940
But once we set up base camp and secure
those modules, my work's done here.

1462
01:48:51,358 --> 01:48:52,692
I'm going home.

1463
01:49:00,701 --> 01:49:04,204
You have attachments.
But even without a family...

1464
01:49:04,622 --> 01:49:09,083
I can promise you that that yearning
to be with other people is powerful.

1465
01:49:09,752 --> 01:49:13,087
That emotion is at the foundation...

1466
01:49:13,756 --> 01:49:16,799
of what makes us human.
It's not to be taken lightly.

1467
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:27,393
- How long have you had that cough?
- A while.

1468
01:49:37,947 --> 01:49:39,864
Mom lets me play in here.

1469
01:49:41,784 --> 01:49:43,034
I don't touch your stuff.

1470
01:50:14,024 --> 01:50:15,650
Just take this gently.

1471
01:50:20,781 --> 01:50:24,158
You know why we couldn't just send machines
on these missions, don't you?

1472
01:50:24,785 --> 01:50:29,414
A machine doesn't improvise well
because you can't program a fear of death.

1473
01:50:30,291 --> 01:50:32,625
Our survival instinct is
our single greatest...

1474
01:50:32,793 --> 01:50:36,337
source of inspiration.
Take you, for example.

1475
01:50:37,047 --> 01:50:38,381
A father...

1476
01:50:38,882 --> 01:50:41,884
with a survival instinct
that extends to your kids.

1477
01:50:43,053 --> 01:50:47,724
What does research tell us is the last
thing you're going to see before you die?

1478
01:50:49,435 --> 01:50:51,894
Your children. Their faces.

1479
01:50:52,229 --> 01:50:54,814
At the moment of death,
your mind's gonna push...

1480
01:50:54,982 --> 01:50:56,691
a little bit harder to survive.

1481
01:50:57,401 --> 01:50:58,443
For them.

1482
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:00,570
Deep breath.

1483
01:51:02,865 --> 01:51:06,617
Uh, hey. I bet you're Coop.
Why don't you have a seat here for me?

1484
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:09,245
It's bad. They cannot stay here.

1485
01:51:09,955 --> 01:51:11,247
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1486
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:21,049
TARS, what's taking so long?

1487
01:51:21,216 --> 01:51:24,093
Professor, I am having trouble
completing the boot up.

1488
01:51:24,261 --> 01:51:25,803
I don't understand.

1489
01:51:32,603 --> 01:51:33,853
It's funny.

1490
01:51:35,939 --> 01:51:37,565
When I left Earth...

1491
01:51:38,567 --> 01:51:40,651
I thought I was prepared to die.

1492
01:51:42,696 --> 01:51:44,030
The truth is...

1493
01:51:46,241 --> 01:51:51,245
I never really considered the
possibility that my planet wasn't the one.

1494
01:51:53,957 --> 01:51:56,292
Nothing worked out the way
it was supposed to.

1495
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:57,502
Let's go.

1496
01:52:05,969 --> 01:52:08,763
All right, buddy, give
me a big deep breath.

1497
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:14,977
What is this?

1498
01:52:15,396 --> 01:52:16,488
What are you doing?

1499
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:19,232
I'm sorry! I can't let
you leave with that ship.

1500
01:52:19,566 --> 01:52:21,901
We're gonna need it
to complete the mission...

1501
01:52:22,236 --> 01:52:25,655
once the others realize
what this place isn't.

1502
01:52:25,948 --> 01:52:28,699
We cannot survive here. I'm sorry!

1503
01:52:29,159 --> 01:52:30,201
I'm sorry!

1504
01:52:39,962 --> 01:52:43,089
- They can't stay here anymore.
- You have to leave right now.

1505
01:52:43,257 --> 01:52:46,801
Let me make something abundantly clear.
You have a responsibility...

1506
01:52:46,969 --> 01:52:50,096
- Oh! Jesus!
- Coop, get her stuff. She's going home.

1507
01:52:50,431 --> 01:52:52,348
Dad didn't raise you to be this dumb, Tom!

1508
01:52:52,516 --> 01:52:56,602
Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did. And
he's buried out back with Mom and Jesse.

1509
01:52:57,187 --> 01:52:59,856
You faked all the data?

1510
01:53:01,567 --> 01:53:02,650
Yeah.

1511
01:53:06,655 --> 01:53:08,364
There's no surface?

1512
01:53:08,532 --> 01:53:09,699
No.

1513
01:53:10,659 --> 01:53:12,660
I tried to do my duty, Cooper...

1514
01:53:12,828 --> 01:53:17,832
but I knew the day that I arrived here
that this place had nothing.

1515
01:53:18,459 --> 01:53:22,253
And I resisted the temptation for years...

1516
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:24,964
but I knew that...

1517
01:53:25,299 --> 01:53:28,134
if I just pressed that button, then...

1518
01:53:28,427 --> 01:53:30,428
somebody would come and save me.

1519
01:53:31,472 --> 01:53:32,972
You fucking coward.

1520
01:53:33,807 --> 01:53:34,849
Yes.

1521
01:53:40,272 --> 01:53:41,314
Yes.

1522
01:53:43,233 --> 01:53:44,275
Yes.

1523
01:53:45,527 --> 01:53:46,569
Yes.

1524
01:53:58,081 --> 01:54:02,627
Listen, if you're not going to go,
let your family go. Just save your family.

1525
01:54:03,128 --> 01:54:05,421
And we go live underground with you?

1526
01:54:05,589 --> 01:54:07,507
Pray that Daddy comes to save us?

1527
01:54:07,674 --> 01:54:11,177
Dad's not coming back.
He never was coming back. It's up to me.

1528
01:54:11,345 --> 01:54:13,221
You're gonna save everybody?

1529
01:54:13,597 --> 01:54:16,432
- Because Dad couldn't do it.
- Dad didn't even try!

1530
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:18,768
Dad just abandoned us!

1531
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,312
He left us here to die.

1532
01:54:22,022 --> 01:54:23,689
Nobody's going with you.

1533
01:54:27,402 --> 01:54:30,112
You gonna wait for your next kid to die?

1534
01:54:33,116 --> 01:54:34,408
Get out.

1535
01:54:35,285 --> 01:54:36,619
And don't come back.

1536
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:43,334
You can keep my stuff.

1537
01:54:54,263 --> 01:54:55,638
Stop it!

1538
01:54:58,642 --> 01:55:00,226
No. No!

1539
01:55:01,311 --> 01:55:04,188
Dr. Mann, there's a 50-50 chance
you're gonna kill yourself!

1540
01:55:05,023 --> 01:55:07,024
Those are the best odds I've had in years.

1541
01:55:27,462 --> 01:55:29,297
Don't judge me, Cooper.

1542
01:55:30,048 --> 01:55:32,300
You were never tested like I was.

1543
01:55:32,926 --> 01:55:34,385
Few men have been.

1544
01:55:42,728 --> 01:55:43,894
You tried your best, Murph.

1545
01:55:53,405 --> 01:55:54,780
You're feeling it, aren't you?

1546
01:55:56,450 --> 01:55:58,284
The survival instinct.

1547
01:55:59,202 --> 01:56:03,539
That's what drove me. it's what drives all
of us. And it's what's gonna save us.

1548
01:56:04,708 --> 01:56:08,044
Because I want to save all of us.
For you, Cooper.

1549
01:56:13,216 --> 01:56:16,761
I'm sorry, I can't watch you
go through this. I'm sorry.

1550
01:56:17,095 --> 01:56:19,764
I thought I could, but I can't.

1551
01:56:20,849 --> 01:56:23,017
I'm here. I'm here for you.

1552
01:56:23,310 --> 01:56:25,353
Just listen to my voice, Cooper.

1553
01:56:26,146 --> 01:56:27,480
I'm right here.

1554
01:56:29,316 --> 01:56:30,650
You're not alone.

1555
01:56:40,369 --> 01:56:41,869
Do you see your children?

1556
01:56:45,123 --> 01:56:46,457
It's okay.

1557
01:56:47,417 --> 01:56:49,168
They're right there with you.

1558
01:56:53,048 --> 01:56:55,633
Did Professor Brand tell you
that poem before you left?

1559
01:56:56,468 --> 01:56:57,968
Do you remember?

1560
01:57:00,347 --> 01:57:03,015
Do not go gentle into that good night

1561
01:57:04,935 --> 01:57:07,728
Old age should burn and rave

1562
01:57:07,896 --> 01:57:09,480
At close of day

1563
01:57:11,066 --> 01:57:13,442
Rage, rage against the dying of the light

1564
01:57:38,093 --> 01:57:39,760
Brand! Help!

1565
01:57:39,928 --> 01:57:41,887
- Help!
- Cooper?

1566
01:57:48,603 --> 01:57:49,812
CASE!

1567
01:57:50,188 --> 01:57:51,480
No air.

1568
01:57:52,315 --> 01:57:53,524
Ammonia.

1569
01:57:54,609 --> 01:57:57,111
Cooper. Cooper, we're coming! CASE!

1570
01:57:57,279 --> 01:57:59,196
- I have a fix.
- Go! Go, go, go!

1571
01:57:59,364 --> 01:58:01,449
And away!

1572
01:58:13,003 --> 01:58:15,212
Cooper, we're coming.
Hang in there. Don't talk.

1573
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:17,673
Try to breathe as little as possible.
We're almost there.

1574
01:58:21,344 --> 01:58:23,345
There's a security lockout, sir.

1575
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:26,766
It requires a person to access function.

1576
01:58:31,813 --> 01:58:33,314
It's all yours, sir.

1577
01:58:41,531 --> 01:58:42,990
Try not to breathe.

1578
01:58:43,992 --> 01:58:45,659
We're coming. We're coming right now.

1579
01:58:45,827 --> 01:58:47,953
CASE, come on! Come on!

1580
01:58:48,121 --> 01:58:50,831
We got to go faster, CASE!
Faster, faster, faster!

1581
01:58:55,337 --> 01:58:57,046
Hang in there. Come on.

1582
01:59:03,553 --> 01:59:06,847
I see him, I see him! CASE, bank!
Bank right!

1583
01:59:25,867 --> 01:59:27,409
Cooper! Cooper!

1584
01:59:27,786 --> 01:59:28,869
I'm here!

1585
01:59:52,102 --> 01:59:54,103
This data makes no sense.

1586
02:00:02,529 --> 02:00:03,779
I'm sorry.

1587
02:00:04,114 --> 02:00:06,699
- What?
- Mann was lying!

1588
02:00:14,457 --> 02:00:16,250
Go. Go.

1589
02:00:17,335 --> 02:00:18,377
Romilly.

1590
02:00:18,753 --> 02:00:19,795
Romilly!

1591
02:00:20,130 --> 02:00:22,548
Romilly! Do you read me, Romilly?

1592
02:00:23,133 --> 02:00:25,134
Step back, professor! Step back!

1593
02:00:33,059 --> 02:00:35,644
- Romilly...
- Romilly, do you read me?

1594
02:00:38,648 --> 02:00:39,982
Keep watch!

1595
02:00:41,151 --> 02:00:42,276
Lois?

1596
02:00:42,777 --> 02:00:45,279
- What happened to caution, CASE?
- Safety first, Cooper.

1597
02:00:46,656 --> 02:00:50,075
Romilly? Romilly, do you read me?
This is Brand.

1598
02:00:52,954 --> 02:00:53,996
Romilly?

1599
02:00:54,164 --> 02:00:56,749
Dr. Brand. Cooper.
There's been an explosion.

1600
02:00:57,375 --> 02:00:59,168
Dr. Mann's compound.

1601
02:01:26,780 --> 02:01:28,822
TARS, TARS, 10 o'clock!

1602
02:01:35,205 --> 02:01:37,164
Let me know when TARS is aboard.

1603
02:01:40,794 --> 02:01:42,670
Romilly did not survive.

1604
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:45,547
I could not save him.

1605
02:01:45,715 --> 02:01:47,195
- TARS is in.
- I'll take her now.

1606
02:01:47,342 --> 02:01:50,219
- Do we have a fix on the Ranger?
- He's pushing into orbit!

1607
02:01:50,387 --> 02:01:53,389
If he takes control of
that ship, we're dead.

1608
02:01:54,599 --> 02:01:57,559
- He'd maroon us?
- He is marooning us.

1609
02:01:59,562 --> 02:02:02,064
I'll meet you guys downstairs.
Go wait by the car.

1610
02:02:09,906 --> 02:02:14,118
Come on! Give me your bag. Get in the
backseat. Get in the backseat now!

1611
02:02:19,749 --> 02:02:21,667
Dr. Mann, please respond.

1612
02:02:22,293 --> 02:02:24,378
Dr. Mann, please respond!

1613
02:02:24,546 --> 02:02:26,755
He doesn't know
the Endurance docking procedure.

1614
02:02:26,923 --> 02:02:29,425
- The autopilot does.
- Not since TARS disabled it.

1615
02:02:30,635 --> 02:02:31,677
Nice.

1616
02:02:31,845 --> 02:02:34,763
- What's your trust setting, TARS?
- Lower than yours apparently.

1617
02:02:38,393 --> 02:02:41,937
Do not attempt docking.
I repeat, do not attempt docking.

1618
02:02:42,105 --> 02:02:43,147
Please res...

1619
02:03:42,582 --> 02:03:44,958
Auto-docking sequence withheld.

1620
02:03:45,126 --> 02:03:47,795
- Override.
- Unauthorized.

1621
02:03:48,505 --> 02:03:49,838
Override.

1622
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:52,216
Unauthorized.

1623
02:03:56,346 --> 02:04:00,474
Do not attempt docking. I repeat,
do not attempt docking. Please resp...

1624
02:04:44,269 --> 02:04:46,436
Moving slowly toward the Endurance.

1625
02:05:10,962 --> 02:05:12,546
Imperfect contact.

1626
02:05:12,714 --> 02:05:14,756
- Override.
- Hatch lockout.

1627
02:05:22,557 --> 02:05:25,100
- Is he locked on yet?
- Imperfectly.

1628
02:05:26,936 --> 02:05:28,187
Dr. Mann, do not...

1629
02:05:49,667 --> 02:05:52,669
Hatch lockout disengaged.

1630
02:06:01,221 --> 02:06:04,723
Dr. Mann, do not,
I repeat, do not open the hatch.

1631
02:06:05,058 --> 02:06:06,934
I repeat, do not open the hatch.

1632
02:06:07,101 --> 02:06:09,937
If you open the hatch,
the airlock will depressurize.

1633
02:06:35,838 --> 02:06:38,158
- What happens if he blows the airlock?
- Nothing good.

1634
02:06:44,013 --> 02:06:46,640
Okay, pull back. Retro thrusters,
everything we've got, CASE!

1635
02:06:46,808 --> 02:06:48,517
- Thrusters are full!
- Back!

1636
02:06:48,685 --> 02:06:50,686
Relay my transmission
to the on board computer...

1637
02:06:50,853 --> 02:06:52,938
and have it rebroadcast
as emergency P.A.

1638
02:06:53,106 --> 02:06:54,147
Dr. Mann...

1639
02:06:56,734 --> 02:06:59,611
I repeat, do not open
the inner hatch. I repeat...

1640
02:06:59,779 --> 02:07:00,821
Brand?

1641
02:07:01,656 --> 02:07:03,699
I don't know what he said to you...

1642
02:07:03,866 --> 02:07:06,535
but I am taking command
of the Endurance.

1643
02:07:06,995 --> 02:07:09,037
And then we can talk
about completing the mission.

1644
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:14,209
Dr. Mann, listen to me.

1645
02:07:15,003 --> 02:07:17,004
This is not about my life.

1646
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:20,882
Or Cooper's life. This
is about all mankind.

1647
02:07:21,467 --> 02:07:22,884
There is a moment...

1648
02:07:29,225 --> 02:07:30,559
It is not sa...

1649
02:07:38,860 --> 02:07:39,901
Oh, my God.

1650
02:07:58,212 --> 02:08:02,174
CASE: There's no point using fuel to
chase... - Analyze the Endurance's spin.

1651
02:08:07,430 --> 02:08:09,639
- Cooper, what are you doing?
- Docking.

1652
02:08:14,228 --> 02:08:17,064
Endurance rotation is 67, 68 RPM.

1653
02:08:17,231 --> 02:08:19,691
Okay, get ready to match our spin
with the retro thrusters.

1654
02:08:19,859 --> 02:08:21,943
- it's not possible.
- No...

1655
02:08:22,111 --> 02:08:23,278
it's necessary.

1656
02:08:34,916 --> 02:08:37,084
Endurance is hitting stratosphere!

1657
02:08:41,130 --> 02:08:43,173
She's got no heat shield.

1658
02:08:46,302 --> 02:08:48,053
- CASE, you ready?
- Ready.

1659
02:08:56,479 --> 02:08:59,648
Cooper! This is no time for caution.

1660
02:09:01,192 --> 02:09:03,652
CASE, if I black out, you take the stick.

1661
02:09:03,820 --> 02:09:06,279
TARS, get ready to engage
the docking mechanism.

1662
02:09:13,329 --> 02:09:14,830
Endurance is starting to heat.

1663
02:09:14,997 --> 02:09:16,331
Twenty feet out.

1664
02:09:16,499 --> 02:09:19,000
I need three degrees starboard, Cooper.

1665
02:09:19,168 --> 02:09:21,169
Ten feet out.

1666
02:09:21,337 --> 02:09:23,839
Cooper, we are lined up.

1667
02:09:24,006 --> 02:09:25,590
Initiating spin!

1668
02:10:07,175 --> 02:10:08,383
Come on, TARS.

1669
02:10:16,642 --> 02:10:18,185
Come on, TARS!

1670
02:10:29,405 --> 02:10:31,823
- We are locked, Cooper.
- Locked. Easing up!

1671
02:10:39,707 --> 02:10:41,041
Easy.

1672
02:10:42,210 --> 02:10:43,543
Easy.

1673
02:10:49,383 --> 02:10:50,884
Retro thrusters!

1674
02:10:58,851 --> 02:11:00,352
Main engines on.

1675
02:11:06,108 --> 02:11:08,818
Pushing out of orbit. Come on, baby.

1676
02:11:16,827 --> 02:11:18,495
Killing main engines!

1677
02:11:19,747 --> 02:11:21,414
Okay, we're out of orbit.

1678
02:11:28,756 --> 02:11:31,633
Okay. And for our next trick!

1679
02:11:33,469 --> 02:11:37,305
it'll have to be good.
We're heading into Gargantua's pull.

1680
02:11:38,224 --> 02:11:39,266
Oh, shit.

1681
02:11:39,767 --> 02:11:41,560
- CASE, take the stick.
- Roger that.

1682
02:12:31,527 --> 02:12:33,862
Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua.

1683
02:12:35,197 --> 02:12:37,157
Shall I use main engines?

1684
02:12:37,325 --> 02:12:38,366
No.

1685
02:12:38,951 --> 02:12:41,202
We got to let her slide as far as we can.

1686
02:12:50,004 --> 02:12:52,881
- Give it to me.
- There's good news, there's bad news.

1687
02:12:53,049 --> 02:12:56,676
Yeah, I've heard that one, TARS.
Give it to me straight.

1688
02:13:05,519 --> 02:13:08,730
The backup generator kicked in,
so the system's stable. They're all good.

1689
02:13:08,898 --> 02:13:09,939
Good.

1690
02:13:10,358 --> 02:13:13,693
Okay. The navigational hub
has been completely destroyed.

1691
02:13:13,861 --> 02:13:16,821
We don't have enough life support
to make it back to Earth...

1692
02:13:16,989 --> 02:13:19,074
but we can scratch our way
to Edmunds' planet.

1693
02:13:19,241 --> 02:13:20,575
What about fuel?

1694
02:13:20,993 --> 02:13:23,495
Not enough. But I have a plan.

1695
02:13:24,121 --> 02:13:28,124
We let Gargantua pull us down
close to her horizon.

1696
02:13:28,626 --> 02:13:31,878
Then a powered slingshot around,
launching us towards Edmunds' planet.

1697
02:13:32,046 --> 02:13:34,547
- Manually?
- That's what I'm here for.

1698
02:13:34,715 --> 02:13:37,425
I'm gonna take us just
inside the critical orbit.

1699
02:13:37,593 --> 02:13:40,113
- What about time slippage?
- Neither of us has time to worry...

1700
02:13:40,262 --> 02:13:41,930
about relativity right now, Dr. Brand.

1701
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:48,061
I'm sorry, Cooper.

1702
02:13:51,190 --> 02:13:54,442
Once we've gathered
enough speed around Gargantua...

1703
02:13:54,777 --> 02:13:56,611
we use Lander 1...

1704
02:13:57,113 --> 02:13:59,406
and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters to...

1705
02:14:00,574 --> 02:14:02,575
push us out of the black hole's gravity.

1706
02:14:04,912 --> 02:14:07,580
The Lander's linkages
have been destroyed...

1707
02:14:07,748 --> 02:14:10,083
so we'll have to control manually.

1708
02:14:11,293 --> 02:14:14,754
Once Lander 1 is spent, TARS will detach...

1709
02:14:14,922 --> 02:14:16,631
And get sucked into that black hole.

1710
02:14:17,258 --> 02:14:19,217
Why does TARS have to detach?

1711
02:14:19,385 --> 02:14:21,428
We have to shed the weight
to escape the gravity.

1712
02:14:21,595 --> 02:14:22,971
Newton's third law.

1713
02:14:23,139 --> 02:14:25,849
The only way humans have ever
figured out of getting somewhere...

1714
02:14:26,016 --> 02:14:27,559
is to leave something behind.

1715
02:14:27,727 --> 02:14:30,770
Cooper, you can't ask TARS
to do this for us.

1716
02:14:30,938 --> 02:14:34,774
He's a robot. So you don't have
to ask him to do anything.

1717
02:14:34,942 --> 02:14:36,234
Cooper, you asshole!

1718
02:14:36,610 --> 02:14:38,611
Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.

1719
02:14:38,863 --> 02:14:41,114
It's what we intended, Dr. Brand.

1720
02:14:41,449 --> 02:14:43,908
It's our only chance to
save people on Earth.

1721
02:14:44,076 --> 02:14:47,287
If I can find a way to transmit
the quantum data I'll find in there...

1722
02:14:47,455 --> 02:14:49,289
they might still make it.

1723
02:14:50,332 --> 02:14:52,959
Let's just hope
there's still someone there to save.

1724
02:15:21,447 --> 02:15:23,114
Maximum velocity achieved.

1725
02:15:24,366 --> 02:15:26,868
Prepare to fire escape thrusters.

1726
02:15:27,036 --> 02:15:28,119
Ready?

1727
02:15:28,287 --> 02:15:29,704
Ready.

1728
02:15:29,872 --> 02:15:31,039
Ready.

1729
02:15:31,207 --> 02:15:34,334
Main engine ignition in three...
two...

1730
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:36,795
one. Mark.

1731
02:15:50,226 --> 02:15:51,476
Come on, baby.

1732
02:15:52,645 --> 02:15:54,813
Lander 1 engines, on my mark.

1733
02:15:55,147 --> 02:15:56,189
Three...

1734
02:15:56,607 --> 02:15:59,400
two... one. Mark.

1735
02:16:04,740 --> 02:16:07,325
Ranger 2 engines, on my mark.

1736
02:16:07,493 --> 02:16:09,869
Three, two, one...

1737
02:16:10,412 --> 02:16:11,579
- Mark.
- Fire!

1738
02:16:21,715 --> 02:16:24,884
This little maneuver's
gonna cost us 51 years!

1739
02:16:25,761 --> 02:16:28,263
You don't sound so bad for pushing 120!

1740
02:16:43,654 --> 02:16:46,823
Lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark.

1741
02:16:47,491 --> 02:16:49,492
Three, two...

1742
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:52,704
one. Mark.

1743
02:16:52,872 --> 02:16:53,955
Detach!

1744
02:16:57,126 --> 02:16:59,627
- Goodbye, TARS.
- Goodbye, Dr. Brand.

1745
02:16:59,795 --> 02:17:02,797
- See you on the other side, Coop.
- See you there, Slick!

1746
02:17:11,307 --> 02:17:12,891
Okay, CASE.

1747
02:17:13,934 --> 02:17:17,312
- Nice reckless flying!
- Learned from the master.

1748
02:17:17,771 --> 02:17:20,356
- Ranger 2, prepare to detach.
- What?

1749
02:17:20,524 --> 02:17:23,443
No! No! Cooper! What are you doing?

1750
02:17:23,903 --> 02:17:27,614
Newton's third law.
You got to leave something behind.

1751
02:17:27,781 --> 02:17:30,199
You told me we had enough resources
for both of us.

1752
02:17:30,367 --> 02:17:32,118
We agreed, Amelia...

1753
02:17:32,494 --> 02:17:33,953
90 percent.

1754
02:17:35,831 --> 02:17:36,915
Don't.

1755
02:17:39,126 --> 02:17:40,293
Detach.

1756
02:17:53,390 --> 02:17:56,142
Okay, I am nosing down.

1757
02:17:59,939 --> 02:18:01,940
Approaching the event horizon.

1758
02:18:04,193 --> 02:18:06,444
Portside, dipping down beneath it...

1759
02:18:07,029 --> 02:18:08,696
to go through it.

1760
02:18:10,282 --> 02:18:13,117
Heading towards blackness.

1761
02:18:13,452 --> 02:18:15,453
I have a visual of the event.

1762
02:18:15,955 --> 02:18:17,330
It's all black.

1763
02:18:19,458 --> 02:18:21,125
TARS, do you read me?

1764
02:18:21,460 --> 02:18:22,961
It's all blackness.

1765
02:18:24,964 --> 02:18:26,965
TARS! Do you read me? Over.

1766
02:18:31,804 --> 02:18:32,971
Okay.

1767
02:18:34,181 --> 02:18:35,431
Screens...

1768
02:18:37,059 --> 02:18:38,559
getting interference.

1769
02:18:40,270 --> 02:18:42,855
Losing control of the stick. I got flashes.

1770
02:18:43,440 --> 02:18:45,608
Flashes of lightness and blackness.

1771
02:18:46,819 --> 02:18:49,320
The turbulence in the
gravity is increasing.

1772
02:18:54,243 --> 02:18:55,493
Ah.

1773
02:18:55,995 --> 02:18:58,830
The computers are going down. Agh.

1774
02:19:09,925 --> 02:19:12,760
Gravitational pull.
I'm losing control of the stick.

1775
02:19:46,128 --> 02:19:47,795
Murph? Murph, come on!

1776
02:19:53,469 --> 02:19:55,470
Eject. Eject.

1777
02:19:56,972 --> 02:19:58,056
Eject.

1778
02:19:58,474 --> 02:19:59,640
Eject.

1779
02:20:00,184 --> 02:20:01,225
Eject.

1780
02:20:01,935 --> 02:20:03,019
Eject.

1781
02:21:55,215 --> 02:21:56,257
Murph.

1782
02:22:06,226 --> 02:22:08,394
Murph! Murph! Murph!

1783
02:22:16,778 --> 02:22:17,820
Murph!

1784
02:22:25,037 --> 02:22:26,954
No, no, no!

1785
02:22:27,122 --> 02:22:28,414
Murph!

1786
02:22:28,582 --> 02:22:30,082
Murph!

1787
02:22:30,250 --> 02:22:31,292
No! No!

1788
02:23:30,978 --> 02:23:32,937
If you're leaving, just go.

1789
02:23:33,438 --> 02:23:34,605
No, no. No.

1790
02:23:36,191 --> 02:23:38,526
No, don't go. Don't go, you idiot.

1791
02:23:38,694 --> 02:23:39,986
Don't go!

1792
02:23:41,947 --> 02:23:43,614
Morse. Morse.

1793
02:23:44,366 --> 02:23:45,408
Morse.

1794
02:23:46,618 --> 02:23:48,411
Dot. Dot.

1795
02:23:48,578 --> 02:23:49,620
S.

1796
02:23:55,752 --> 02:23:56,794
T.

1797
02:24:01,383 --> 02:24:02,466
A.

1798
02:24:02,634 --> 02:24:03,718
Dash!

1799
02:24:06,513 --> 02:24:07,847
Dash! Dash!

1800
02:24:08,348 --> 02:24:09,390
Murph!

1801
02:24:09,558 --> 02:24:11,559
Murph, we don't have time for this!
Come on!

1802
02:24:11,977 --> 02:24:13,102
Y.

1803
02:24:18,400 --> 02:24:19,442
"Stay!"

1804
02:24:30,537 --> 02:24:32,872
Come on. Come on, Murph. Come on!

1805
02:24:33,540 --> 02:24:35,333
What's it say? What's it say, Murph?

1806
02:24:36,126 --> 02:24:37,209
What's it say?

1807
02:24:47,763 --> 02:24:48,888
"Stay."

1808
02:25:24,633 --> 02:25:26,092
Tell him, Murph.

1809
02:25:26,259 --> 02:25:27,468
Make him stay.

1810
02:25:30,806 --> 02:25:32,473
Make him stay, Murph.

1811
02:25:41,483 --> 02:25:43,359
Make him stay, Murph.

1812
02:25:44,820 --> 02:25:46,946
Don't let me leave, Murph!

1813
02:25:50,158 --> 02:25:52,576
Don't let me leave, Murph!

1814
02:25:58,375 --> 02:26:00,709
No! No! No!

1815
02:26:21,398 --> 02:26:22,898
It was you.

1816
02:26:34,369 --> 02:26:36,412
You were my ghost.

1817
02:26:46,131 --> 02:26:49,133
Cooper. Cooper. Come in, Cooper.

1818
02:26:50,927 --> 02:26:53,429
- TARS?
- Roger that.

1819
02:26:55,223 --> 02:26:57,850
- You survived.
- Somewhere...

1820
02:26:58,393 --> 02:27:00,436
in their fifth dimension.

1821
02:27:00,604 --> 02:27:02,938
They saved us.

1822
02:27:03,106 --> 02:27:08,319
Yeah? Who the hell is "they"?
And just why would they want to help us?

1823
02:27:08,487 --> 02:27:11,197
I don't know, but they constructed
this three-dimensional space...

1824
02:27:11,364 --> 02:27:14,658
inside their five-dimensional reality
to allow you to understand it.

1825
02:27:14,826 --> 02:27:16,785
Yeah, that ain't working.

1826
02:27:16,953 --> 02:27:18,496
Yes, it is.

1827
02:27:18,663 --> 02:27:22,541
You've seen that time is represented here
as a physical dimension.

1828
02:27:22,709 --> 02:27:25,544
You have worked out that you can exert
a force across space-time.

1829
02:27:26,213 --> 02:27:29,381
Gravity to send a message.

1830
02:27:29,758 --> 02:27:31,091
Affirmative.

1831
02:27:33,678 --> 02:27:34,803
Gravity...

1832
02:27:35,931 --> 02:27:39,266
can cross the dimensions,
including time.

1833
02:27:39,601 --> 02:27:40,893
Apparently.

1834
02:27:44,773 --> 02:27:46,774
Do you have the quantum data?

1835
02:27:47,192 --> 02:27:48,817
Roger. I have it.

1836
02:27:49,778 --> 02:27:53,781
I am transmitting it on all wavelengths,
but nothing is getting out, Cooper.

1837
02:27:53,949 --> 02:27:56,200
I can do this. I can do this.

1838
02:27:56,660 --> 02:27:59,411
But such complicated data to a child?

1839
02:27:59,579 --> 02:28:00,704
Not just any child.

1840
02:28:00,872 --> 02:28:02,248
What else?

1841
02:28:02,791 --> 02:28:04,959
Oh, come on, Dad.

1842
02:28:07,128 --> 02:28:09,296
Murph, the fire's out! Come on!

1843
02:28:09,464 --> 02:28:13,467
Even if you communicate it here, she won't
understand its significance for years.

1844
02:28:14,261 --> 02:28:15,719
I get that, TARS.

1845
02:28:15,887 --> 02:28:20,558
But we've got to figure something out or
the people on Earth are gonna die. Think!

1846
02:28:20,725 --> 02:28:22,309
Cooper...

1847
02:28:22,477 --> 02:28:24,979
they didn't bring us here
to change the past.

1848
02:28:28,567 --> 02:28:30,067
Say that again.

1849
02:28:30,235 --> 02:28:33,696
They didn't bring us
here to change the past.

1850
02:28:38,118 --> 02:28:40,077
No, they didn't bring us here at all.

1851
02:28:44,708 --> 02:28:46,375
We brought ourselves.

1852
02:28:55,635 --> 02:28:59,680
TARS, give me the coordinates
for NASA in binary.

1853
02:29:00,223 --> 02:29:02,683
In binary. Roger. Feeding data.

1854
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:28,917
"It's not a ghost."

1855
02:29:30,670 --> 02:29:32,171
"it's gravity."

1856
02:29:32,505 --> 02:29:34,173
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

1857
02:29:34,841 --> 02:29:36,634
I brought myself here!

1858
02:29:37,510 --> 02:29:41,013
We're here to communicate
with the three-dimensional world.

1859
02:29:41,431 --> 02:29:42,931
We're the bridge!

1860
02:29:50,940 --> 02:29:52,733
I thought they chose me.

1861
02:29:56,071 --> 02:29:59,740
- But they didn't choose me, they
chose her. TARS: For what, Cooper?

1862
02:30:02,243 --> 02:30:03,911
To save the world.

1863
02:30:08,208 --> 02:30:12,586
All of this is one little girl's bedroom.
Every moment.

1864
02:30:12,921 --> 02:30:14,338
It's infinitely complex.

1865
02:30:14,506 --> 02:30:19,259
They have access to infinite time and
space, but they're not bound by anything!

1866
02:30:19,427 --> 02:30:24,098
They can't find a specific place in time.
They can't communicate.

1867
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:28,602
That's why I'm here.
I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph...

1868
02:30:28,770 --> 02:30:30,270
just like I found this moment.

1869
02:30:30,438 --> 02:30:32,773
- How, Cooper?
- Love, TARS, love.

1870
02:30:32,941 --> 02:30:35,266
It's just like Brand said.
My connection with

1871
02:30:35,278 --> 02:30:37,361
Murph, it is quantifiable.
it's the key!

1872
02:30:37,529 --> 02:30:39,405
What are we here to do?

1873
02:30:40,323 --> 02:30:42,199
Find how to tell her.

1874
02:30:44,994 --> 02:30:46,328
The watch.

1875
02:30:49,457 --> 02:30:50,624
The watch.

1876
02:30:52,001 --> 02:30:53,127
That's it.

1877
02:30:55,630 --> 02:30:58,632
We code the data into the movement
of the second hand.

1878
02:31:02,262 --> 02:31:05,472
TARS, translate the data into Morse
and feed it to me.

1879
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:09,935
Translating data to Morse.
Cooper, what if she never came back for it?

1880
02:31:11,604 --> 02:31:14,273
She will. She will.

1881
02:31:15,483 --> 02:31:17,109
Murph, I can see his car!

1882
02:31:18,319 --> 02:31:19,486
He's coming, Murph!

1883
02:31:21,322 --> 02:31:23,157
Okay. I'm coming down.

1884
02:31:24,617 --> 02:31:26,118
How do you know?

1885
02:31:29,330 --> 02:31:31,165
Because I gave it to her.

1886
02:31:36,546 --> 02:31:39,047
Roger. Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.

1887
02:31:42,552 --> 02:31:43,677
Dot-dot...

1888
02:31:45,013 --> 02:31:46,680
dash-dot.

1889
02:31:47,140 --> 02:31:48,807
Dot-dash-dot-dot.

1890
02:31:49,184 --> 02:31:51,852
Dot-dash-dot-dot.

1891
02:31:52,353 --> 02:31:53,687
Dash-dash-dash.

1892
02:31:54,022 --> 02:31:56,273
Dash, dash, dash.

1893
02:32:14,542 --> 02:32:15,876
He came back!

1894
02:32:16,795 --> 02:32:20,964
It was him all the time!
I didn't know. it was him!

1895
02:32:22,050 --> 02:32:24,009
Dad's gonna save us.

1896
02:33:06,761 --> 02:33:08,011
Eureka!

1897
02:33:11,766 --> 02:33:13,100
It's traditional.

1898
02:33:17,689 --> 02:33:19,314
Eureka!

1899
02:33:24,028 --> 02:33:25,529
Did it work?

1900
02:33:25,697 --> 02:33:27,531
I think it might have.

1901
02:33:28,908 --> 02:33:30,200
How do you know?

1902
02:33:30,368 --> 02:33:33,745
Because the bulk beings
are closing the tesseract.

1903
02:33:37,584 --> 02:33:39,585
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

1904
02:33:40,753 --> 02:33:42,588
They're not "beings."

1905
02:33:43,256 --> 02:33:44,590
They're us.

1906
02:33:46,634 --> 02:33:49,761
What I've been doing for Murph,
they're doing for me.

1907
02:33:50,305 --> 02:33:51,805
For all of us.

1908
02:33:51,973 --> 02:33:54,224
Cooper, people couldn't build this.

1909
02:33:54,392 --> 02:33:56,768
No. No, not yet.

1910
02:33:57,145 --> 02:33:58,604
But one day.

1911
02:33:59,272 --> 02:34:02,482
Not you and me. But people.

1912
02:34:03,151 --> 02:34:07,195
A civilization that's evolved past
the four dimensions we know.

1913
02:34:13,786 --> 02:34:15,287
What happens now?

1914
02:35:17,892 --> 02:35:19,351
Mr. Cooper.

1915
02:35:23,564 --> 02:35:25,273
All right. Let's take it slow, sir.

1916
02:35:25,692 --> 02:35:27,818
Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.

1917
02:35:27,986 --> 02:35:33,031
Remember, you're no spring chicken anymore.
Actually, you are 124 years old.

1918
02:35:40,039 --> 02:35:41,373
Take it slow, sir.

1919
02:35:42,291 --> 02:35:44,584
You were, uh, extremely lucky.

1920
02:35:44,919 --> 02:35:48,255
The Rangers found you with only minutes
left in your oxygen supply.

1921
02:36:02,437 --> 02:36:03,770
Where am I?

1922
02:36:05,440 --> 02:36:06,982
Cooper Station.

1923
02:36:08,401 --> 02:36:09,943
Currently orbiting Saturn.

1924
02:36:11,946 --> 02:36:13,989
Cooper Station.

1925
02:36:16,451 --> 02:36:18,452
Nice of you to name it after me.

1926
02:36:22,290 --> 02:36:23,373
What?

1927
02:36:23,541 --> 02:36:26,752
The station isn't named after you, sir.
It's, uh, named after your daughter.

1928
02:36:27,253 --> 02:36:30,255
Although she's always maintained
just how important you were.

1929
02:36:30,423 --> 02:36:32,132
Is she still alive?

1930
02:36:34,093 --> 02:36:35,969
She'll be here in a couple weeks.

1931
02:36:37,013 --> 02:36:39,473
She is far too old to be transferring
from another station...

1932
02:36:39,640 --> 02:36:42,017
but when she heard
that you'd been found...

1933
02:36:43,227 --> 02:36:45,937
well, this is, uh, Murphy Cooper
we're talking about.

1934
02:36:46,814 --> 02:36:48,315
Yes, it is.

1935
02:36:50,443 --> 02:36:52,944
We'll have you checked out of here
in a couple days.

1936
02:36:55,615 --> 02:36:58,116
I'm sure you'll be excited to see
what's in store.

1937
02:36:59,368 --> 02:37:03,330
I actually, uh, did a paper on you
in high school.

1938
02:37:03,664 --> 02:37:05,999
I know all about your life back on Earth.

1939
02:37:07,668 --> 02:37:08,835
Oh, yeah.

1940
02:37:09,003 --> 02:37:10,253
Right.

1941
02:37:12,673 --> 02:37:18,011
If... If you'll follow me,
we've got a really good situation for you.

1942
02:37:21,349 --> 02:37:25,393
So, uh, when I made my suggestion
to Miss Cooper...

1943
02:37:26,312 --> 02:37:29,106
I was delighted to hear
that she thought it was perfect.

1944
02:37:32,485 --> 02:37:35,779
It was just constant.
Just that steady blow of dirt.

1945
02:37:35,947 --> 02:37:38,865
Of course, I didn't speak
to her personally.

1946
02:37:39,033 --> 02:37:41,034
We always set the plate upside-down.

1947
02:37:41,202 --> 02:37:43,954
Glasses or cups,
whatever it was, upside-down.

1948
02:37:44,122 --> 02:37:49,042
Well, my dad was a farmer.
Uh, like everybody else back then.

1949
02:37:49,210 --> 02:37:51,670
There just wasn't enough food.

1950
02:37:51,838 --> 02:37:54,548
We wore little things, little strips...

1951
02:37:54,715 --> 02:37:59,886
of sheet over our nose and mouth
so we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

1952
02:38:00,054 --> 02:38:03,515
Well, it was pretty exciting for me
because it was hope.

1953
02:38:03,683 --> 02:38:05,870
I don't care who describes
it, there is no way

1954
02:38:05,882 --> 02:38:07,894
for it to be exaggerated.
It was that bad.

1955
02:38:08,062 --> 02:38:11,731
She did confirm
just how much you loved farming.

1956
02:38:12,066 --> 02:38:13,733
- Oh, she did, did she?
- Yeah.

1957
02:38:13,901 --> 02:38:15,110
Come here.

1958
02:38:15,695 --> 02:38:20,657
Home sweet home. Everything
replaced and put back where it...

1959
02:38:27,039 --> 02:38:29,082
- Hey, is this...?
- Oh, yeah.

1960
02:38:29,250 --> 02:38:32,252
The machine we found out near Saturn
when we found you. Yes.

1961
02:38:32,420 --> 02:38:35,088
Its, uh, power source was shot,
but we could get you another one.

1962
02:38:35,256 --> 02:38:37,424
Yes. Please.

1963
02:38:38,634 --> 02:38:39,968
Settings.

1964
02:38:40,428 --> 02:38:41,928
General settings.

1965
02:38:42,430 --> 02:38:44,264
Security settings.

1966
02:38:46,976 --> 02:38:49,269
Honesty, new setting:

1967
02:38:50,438 --> 02:38:52,063
95 percent.

1968
02:38:52,398 --> 02:38:54,900
Confirmed. Additional customization?

1969
02:38:55,776 --> 02:38:56,902
Humor:

1970
02:38:58,404 --> 02:38:59,905
75 percent.

1971
02:39:00,281 --> 02:39:01,615
Confirmed.

1972
02:39:02,283 --> 02:39:05,410
Auto self-destruct T-minus 10, nine...

1973
02:39:05,578 --> 02:39:07,495
Let's make that 60 percent.

1974
02:39:09,790 --> 02:39:11,917
Sixty percent confirmed.

1975
02:39:12,543 --> 02:39:15,629
- Knock-knock.
- You want 55?

1976
02:39:20,509 --> 02:39:22,636
Is this really what it was like?

1977
02:39:24,847 --> 02:39:27,265
It was never this clean, Slick. Heh.

1978
02:39:31,771 --> 02:39:35,440
I don't care much for this pretending
we're back where we started.

1979
02:39:37,526 --> 02:39:39,819
I want to know where we are.

1980
02:39:41,447 --> 02:39:42,989
Where we're going.

1981
02:39:47,536 --> 02:39:50,622
- Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there.
- Yeah.

1982
02:39:50,790 --> 02:39:51,873
Family?

1983
02:39:52,041 --> 02:39:55,919
Yeah, they all came out to see her. She's
been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.

1984
02:40:28,995 --> 02:40:30,870
You told them I like farming.

1985
02:40:36,836 --> 02:40:38,503
It was me, Murph.

1986
02:40:40,965 --> 02:40:42,757
I was your ghost.

1987
02:40:44,051 --> 02:40:45,677
I know.

1988
02:40:47,471 --> 02:40:52,183
People didn't believe me. They thought
that I was doing it all myself.

1989
02:40:52,351 --> 02:40:53,393
But...

1990
02:40:56,272 --> 02:40:58,231
I knew who it was.

1991
02:41:03,195 --> 02:41:05,363
Nobody believed me.

1992
02:41:05,865 --> 02:41:08,283
But I knew you'd come back.

1993
02:41:10,870 --> 02:41:12,078
How?

1994
02:41:14,081 --> 02:41:17,208
Because my dad promised me.

1995
02:41:23,257 --> 02:41:25,258
Well, I'm here now, Murph.

1996
02:41:26,552 --> 02:41:27,886
I'm here.

1997
02:41:29,347 --> 02:41:30,680
No.

1998
02:41:32,767 --> 02:41:36,895
No parent should have to watch
their own child die.

1999
02:41:39,815 --> 02:41:42,484
I have my kids here for me now.

2000
02:41:45,279 --> 02:41:46,780
You go.

2001
02:41:49,700 --> 02:41:51,201
Where?

2002
02:41:54,705 --> 02:41:56,289
Brand.

2003
02:42:06,133 --> 02:42:07,759
She's out there...

2004
02:42:14,183 --> 02:42:15,934
setting up camp.

2005
02:42:42,420 --> 02:42:44,129
Alone...

2006
02:42:45,297 --> 02:42:47,966
in a strange galaxy.

2007
02:42:58,853 --> 02:43:03,523
Maybe right now
she's settling in for the long nap...

2008
02:43:21,876 --> 02:43:24,711
by the light of our new sun...

2009
02:43:40,186 --> 02:43:42,228
in our new home.

2010
