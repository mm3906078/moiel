my dad was a farmer.

Um, like everybody
else back then.

Of course, he didn't

Sorry, Murph. Go back to bed.

- I thought you were the ghost.
- No.

There are no such
things as ghosts, babe.

16
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,210
Grandpa says you can get ghosts.

17
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:13,382
Maybe that's because Grandpa's close
to being one himself. Back to bed.

WOMAN 1: The wheat had died.

21
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,962
The blight came
and we had to burn it.

22
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,590
And we still had corn.
We had acres of corn.

23

But, uh, mostly we had dust.

WOMAN 2: I guess I can't describe it.
It was just constant.

25
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,684
Just that steady blow...

26
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,102
of dirt.

27
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,274
WOMAN 3: We wore, um,
little strips of sheet...

28
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,151
sometimes over our nose
and mouth...

29
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,821

- Check?
- Yes, sir.

00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,637
Not at the table, Murph.

37
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,223
Dad, can you fix this?

COOPER: What the heck
did you do...

39
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:48,477
- to my lander?
- Wasn't me.

40
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,521
Let me guess. It was your ghost?

41
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,024
It knocked it off. It
keeps knocking books off.

TOM: No such thing
as ghosts, dumb-ass.

- I looked it up. It's called a poltergeist.

Dad, tell her.

45
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,489
Well, it's not very
scientific, Murph.

46
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,992
You said science was about admitting
what we don't know.

47

- She's got you there.
- Hey.

want to talk science?

Don't tell me you're afraid
of some ghost. No, you got to go further.

52
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:22,345

I'm not always gonna
be here to help you.

What's going on, Murph?

83
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,277
Why did you and Mom name me
after something that's bad?

Murphy's Law doesn't mean
that something bad will happen.

87

What it means is whatever
can happen will happen.

just fine with us.

00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,185
Yeah.

95
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:52,161
It's an Indian Air Force drone. Solar

Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.

100

stop. Don't stop!

Go.

at the edge of the reservoir.

COOPER: Delhi Mission Control
went down, same as ours...

120
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,031
- ten years ago.
- Heh.

121
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,283
So for ten years?

122
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,872
- Why did it come down so low?
- I don't know.

123
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,958
Maybe the sun cooked its brain
or it was looking for something.

124
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,377
- What?
- Give me a large flatblade.

125
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,464
Maybe some kind
of signal? I don't know.

126
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,221
What are you gonna do with it?

127
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,308
I'm gonna give it something
socially responsible to do...

128
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,518
like drive a combine.

129
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,604
Can't we just let it go?

130
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,566
It wasn't hurting anybody.

131
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,737
This thing needs to learn
how to adapt, Murph...

- Hey. Relax.

Little late, Coop.

141
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,852
Yeah, we had a flat.

142
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,564
And I guess you had to stop
off at the Asian fighter plane store.

No, actually, sir,
that's a surveillance drone.

With outstanding solar

Take a seat.

00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,742
So, uh...

147
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,037
we got Tom's scores back.

148

He's going to make
an excellent farmer.

Yeah, he's got a knack
for it. What about college?

150

The university only takes a handful.
They don't have the resources to...

151
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,591
I still pay my taxes.

There's no more armies.

Well, it doesn't go
to the university.

Look, Coop, you have
to be realistic.

155
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,768
You're ruling my son
out for college now?

156
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,814
- The kid's 15.

About what, 32?

but only one to measure my son's future?

160
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,413
Come on. You're
a well-educated man, Coop.

161
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,540
- And a trained pilot.
- And an engineer.

162
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:11,795
Okay, well, right now
we don't need more engineers.

163
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:16,592
We didn't run out of television screens
and planes. We ran out of food.

164
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,346
The world needs farmers.
Good farmers, like you.

165
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,890
- And Tom.
- Uneducated farmers.

166
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,728
We're a caretaker generation, Coop.
And things are getting better.

167
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,023
- Maybe your grandkids will get to be engin...
- Are we done here, sir?

168
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,400
No.

169
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,403
Miss Hanley's here
to talk about Murph.

170
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,281
HANLEY: Murph is a great
kid. She's really bright.

171
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,700
But she's been having a little trouble
lately.

172
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,245
She brought this in to show the students.
The section on the lunar landings.

173
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,915
Yeah, it's one of my old
textbooks.

174
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,376
She always loved the pictures.

175
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,254
It's an old federal textbook. We've replaced
them with the corrected versions.

176
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,464
Corrected?

177
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:59,760
Explaining how the Apollo missions were
faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

178
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,435
You don't believe
we went to the moon?

179
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,563
It was a brilliant
piece of propaganda.

180
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,566
The Soviets bankrupted
themselves pouring resources...

181
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,985
into rockets and other
useless machines.

182
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,237
"Useless machines."

183
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:22,491
If we don't want a repeat of the excess
and wastefulness of the 20th century, then...

184
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,453
we need to teach our kids about this
planet, not tales of leaving it.

185
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:31,291
One of those useless machines
they used to make was called an MRI.

186
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:35,003
If we had any of those left, the doctors
would've been able to find...

187
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,924
the cyst in my wife's brain
before she died instead of afterwards.

188
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,177
Then she'd have been the one listening
to this instead of me...

189
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,431
which would have been a good
thing, because she was always...

190
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,516
the calmer one.

191
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,269
I'm sorry about your wife,
Mr. Cooper.

192
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:55,190
But Murph got into a fistfight with several
of her classmates over this...

193
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,025
Apollo nonsense.

194
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,653
So we thought it best to bring
you in and see what ideas...

195
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,489
you might have for dealing with her
behavior on the home front.

196
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,743
Yeah, you know what? Um,
there's a game tomorrow night.

197
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,037
She's going through a bit
of a baseball phase.

198
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:13,417
Her favorite team is playing.
There's gonna be candy and soda and...

199
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,338
I think I'll take her to that.

Coop, those combines you
rebuilt went haywire.

206
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,733
Just reset the controllers.

207
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,694
I did that. Now you
should come take a look.

off the fields and heading over.

with the compass.

210

about which book.

00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,812
I've been working
on it, like you said.

214

- Why?

In case the ghost
is trying to communicate.

216
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,530
I'm trying Morse.

217
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,365
Morse?

218
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,783
Yeah.

219
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,828
- Dots and dashes, used...
- I know what Morse code is, Murph.

220
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,914
I just don't think
your bookshelf's trying to talk to you.

221
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,888
Had to reset every compass clock
and GPS to offset for the anomaly.

222
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,725
- Which is?
- I don't know.

223

224
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,898

time we switched on the tractor.

225
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,738
I hear your meeting at the school
didn't go so well.

231

gadget or idea. Like
every day was Christmas.

But six billion people...

233

just try to imagine that.

234
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,895

up in the sky and wonder...

00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,673
at our place in the stars.

243
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:54,471
Now we just look down and worry
about our place in the dirt.

Cooper, you were
good at something...

and you never got a chance
to do anything with it.

marked on your map. Where did you get them?

315
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,386
Where's my daughter?

316
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:16,472
Don't make me take you
down again. Sit down!

317
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,017
COOPER: Oh, you still think
you're a Marine, pal?

318
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,769
Marines don't exist anymore.

319
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:27,025
- And I got grunts like you mowing my grass.
- Where did you find those coordinates?

320
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,777
But you don't look
much like a lawnmower.

321
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,780
Think I'll turn you
into an overqualified vacuum cleaner.

322
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,157
WOMAN: No, you won't.

323
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,702
TARS, back down, please.

324
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:42,332
You know, you're taking a risk
using ex-military security.

325
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,628
They're old, and their control
units are unpredictable.

326
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,796
It's what the government
could spare.

327
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,298
(PANTING)

328
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:51,633
Who are you?

329
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,426
Dr. Brand.

330
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,970
I knew a Dr. Brand once.
He was a professor.

331
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:57,847
What makes you think I'm not?

332
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,642
Wasn't near as cute, either.

333
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,478
Please, Dr. Brand. I don't
have any idea what this is.

334
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,814
Now I'm scared for my daughter
and want her by my side.

335
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,442
You give me that, I'll tell you
anything you want to know.

336
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,823
Get the principals and the girl
in the conference room, please.

337
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,534
Your daughter is fine.

338
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,036
Bright kid.

339
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,455
Must have a very smart mother.

340
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:25,041
It's pretty clear you
don't want any visitors.

341
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:29,170
So why don't you just let us back
up from your fence and we'll be on our way? Huh?

342
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:32,006
- It's not that simple.
- Well, sure, it is.

343
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:36,010
I don't know anything about you. I don't
know anything about this place.

344
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,054
Yes, you do.

345
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:44,852
Dad!

346
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:48,564
Hello, Cooper.

347
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,067
Professor Brand.

348
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,196
MAN: Explain to me how you
found this facility.

349
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:58,658
Kind of an accident. We sort of stumbled
upon it. We were on a salvage run...

350
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:01,536
You're sitting in the best-kept
secret in the world.

351
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:05,206
Nobody stumbles in here.
Nobody stumbles out.

352
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,208
BRAND: Cooper, please.

353
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,752
Cooperate with these people.

354
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,129
Look.

355
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,715
It's kind of hard to explain.

356
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:18,219
We learned these coordinates
from an anomaly.

357
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,305
What sort of anomaly?

358
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,766
I hesitate to term it supernatural,
but it definitely wasn't scientific.

359
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:27,854
You're going to have to be
specific, Mr. Cooper. Right now.

360
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:29,272
It was gravity.

361
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:37,155
Um, what sort of gravitational
anomaly? Where was this?

362
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:40,616
Now, I'm real happy that you're
excited about gravity, bud...

363
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,995
but you're not getting any answers
from us until I get assurances.

364
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,455
- Assurances?
- COOPER: Yeah.

365
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,751
Like, that we're getting out of here. And
I don't mean in the trunk of some car.

366
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,586
(ALL LAUGH)

367
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,422
Don't you know who we are, Coop?

368
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,840
No, professor, I don't.

369
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,009
WOMAN: You know my father,
Professor Brand.

370
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,927
We're NASA.

371
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,931
- NASA?
- BRAND: NASA.

372
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,059
The same NASA you flew for.

373
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,780
COOPER: I heard they shut
you down, sir...

374
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,240
for refusing to drop bombs
from the stratosphere...

375
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,950
onto starving people.

376
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,453
When they realized that killing
other people was...

377
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,456
not a long-term solution,
then they needed us back.

378
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,625
- In secret.
- Why secret?

379
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:34,629
BRAND: Because public opinion wouldn't
allow spending on space exploration.

380
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:37,382
Not while you're struggling
to put food on the table.

381
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:39,967
Blight.

382
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:44,263
Wheat seven years
ago. Okra this year.

383
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,682
Now there's just corn.

384
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:48,976
And we're growing more
than we ever have.

385
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:53,314
But like the potatoes in Ireland
and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...

386
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,401
the corn will die.

387
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,194
Soon.

388
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,324
(COOPER SIGHS)

389
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:07,078
We'll find a way,
professor. We always have.

390
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,833
Driven by the unshakable
faith the Earth is ours.

391
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,210
Not just ours, no.

392
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,337
But it is our home.

393
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:21,008
Earth's atmosphere is 80
percent nitrogen.

394
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,885
We don't even breathe nitrogen.

395
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:28,391
Blight does. And as it thrives,
our air gets less and less oxygen.

396
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,019
The last people to starve
will be the first to suffocate.

397
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,355
And
your daughter's generation...

398
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,276
will be the last
to survive on Earth.

399
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:42,029
WOMAN: Murph is tired. I was wondering
if she could take a nap in my office.

400
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,031
Yeah. Thank you.

401
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:47,869
Okay...

402
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:52,373
now you need to tell me
what your plan is to save the world.

403
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,544
We're not meant to save the world.
We're meant to leave it.

404
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,426
COOPER: Rangers.

405
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:08,681
The last components of our one versatile
ship in orbit, the Endurance.

406
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,600
Our final expedition.

407
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:14,353
You sent people out there
looking for a new home?

408
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,272
The Lazarus missions.

409
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:19,567
- Oh, that sounds cheerful.
- Lazarus came back from the dead.

410
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,903
Sure, but he had to die
in the first place.

411
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,239
There's not a planet in our solar
system that could sustain life...

412
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,909
and the nearest
star's over a thousand years away.

413
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,745
That doesn't
even qualify as futile.

414
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:33,748
Where'd you send them?

415
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,583
Cooper...

416
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,544
I can't tell you anymore
unless you agree...

417
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,546
to pilot this craft.

418
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:44,008
- You're the best pilot we ever had.
- I barely left the stratosphere.

419
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,427
This team never
left the simulator.

420
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:50,556
We need a pilot, and this is the mission
that you were trained for.

421
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,225
Without even knowing it?

422
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:57,522
An hour ago, you didn't even know
I was alive. You were going anyway.

423
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,398
We had no choice.

424
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,317
But something sent you here.

425
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:04,362
- They chose you.
- Who's "they"?

426
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,247
How long would I be gone?

427
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,750
Hard to know. Years?

428
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,086
I've got kids, professor.

429
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,630
Get out there and save them.

430
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,385
Who's "they"?

431
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:31,347
We started detecting gravitational
anomalies almost 50 years ago.

432
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:35,309
Mostly small distortions to our instruments
in the upper atmosphere.

433
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,604
In fact, I believe you
encountered one yourself.

434
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:41,274
Yeah, over the Straights.

435
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:45,319
My crash. Something
tripped my fly-by-wire.

436
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:46,696
Exactly.

437
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:52,451
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this:

438
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,620
Out near Saturn...

439
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,872
a disturbance of space-time.

440
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:02,128
- Is that a wormhole?
- It appeared 48 years ago.

441
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,505
And it leads where?

442
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,674
Another galaxy.

443
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,678
A wormhole's not a naturally
occurring phenomenon.

444
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,263
Someone placed it there.

445
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,557
- "They"?
- Mm.

446
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:19,145
And whoever they are, they appear
to be looking out for us.

447
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,189
That wormhole lets us
travel to other stars.

448
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,275
It came along right
as we needed it.

449
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,361
They've put potentially habitable
worlds right within our reach.

450
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,447
Twelve, in fact,
from our initial probes.

451
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,991
- You sent probes into that?
- Mm-hm.

452
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,161
We sent people into it.
Ten years ago.

453
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,164
The Lazarus missions.

454
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,738
BRAND: Twelve
possible worlds...

455
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,209
twelve Ranger
launches carrying...

456
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,087
the bravest humans
ever to live...

457
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,882
led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

458
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,385
Each person's landing pod had
enough life support for two years.

459
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,512
But they could use hibernation
to stretch that...

460
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,891
making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

461
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:00,895
Their mission was to assess their world,
and if it showed potential...

462
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:05,650
then they could send out a signal, bed
down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.

463
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,860
And what if the world
didn't show promise?

464
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,904
Hence the bravery.

465
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,240
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12.

466
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,533
No.

467
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,204
Data transmission back
through the wormhole is rudimentary.

468
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:23,417
Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us
some clue as to which worlds have potential.

469
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,378
And one system shows promise.

470
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,255
One. That's a bit
of a long shot, isn't it?

471
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:31,926
One system
with three potential worlds?

472
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,928
No long shot.

473
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,223
Okay.

474
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,267
So if we find a home...

475
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:46,399
- then what?
- That's the long shot.

476
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,944
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

477
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,406
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

478
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:08,045
COOPER: This entire
facility's a centrifuge.

479
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,881
Some kind of vehicle.
A space station?

480
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,967
BRAND: Both. Plan A.

481
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:15,219
How do you get it
off the ground?

482
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:19,056
The first gravitational
anomalies changed everything.

483
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:23,728
Suddenly we knew that harnessing
gravity was real.

484
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:28,733
So I started working on a theory
and we started building this station.

485
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,193
But you haven't solved it yet.

486
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,821
That's why there's Plan B.

487
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:39,034
The problem is gravity. How to get a viable
amount of human life off the planet.

488
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,494
This is one way.

489
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,330
Plan B: A population bomb.

490
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:48,419
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs weighing
in at just under 900 kilos.

491
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,629
How would you raise them?

492
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,257
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

493
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:57,303
After that, with surrogacy,
the growth becomes exponential.

494
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:01,307
Within 30 years, we could
have a colony of hundreds.

495
00:35:01,475 --> 00:35:04,852
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

496
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,021
This takes care of that.

497
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,648
But what about the people
here? You just...

498
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,358
give up on them?

499
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,235
My kids?

500
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:17,114
That's why Plan A
is a lot more fun.

501
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,244
- How far have you got?
- Almost there.

502
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,830
You're asking me
to hang everything...

503
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,208
on an almost.

504
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:30,044
I'm asking you to trust me.

505
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:32,963
(SIGHS)

506
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,799
Find us a new home.

507
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,551
And by the time you return...

508
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,805
I will have solved
the problem of gravity.

509
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,349
I give you my word.

510
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,488
MURPH: Go away!

511
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,208
Murph.

512
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,586
MURPH: Go! If you're
leaving, just go.

513
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:18,217
DONALD: This world was never
enough for you, was it, Coop?

514
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:22,805
What, because heading out there
is what I feel like I was born to do?

515
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,599
And it excites me? Heh.

516
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,769
No, that does not make it wrong.

517
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,062
It might.

518
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,566
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

519
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,652
The why of the thing,
that's the foundation.

520
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,904
And the foundation's solid.

521
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:47,079
We farmers, we sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say:

522
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,622
"Next year."

523
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,960
Well, next year ain't gonna
save us, nor the one after that.

524
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:57,923
This world's a treasure, Donald,
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.

525
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,432
Mankind was born on Earth, it
was never meant to die here.

526
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,771
Tom will be all right, but you got
to make things right with Murph.

527
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:13,981
I will.

528
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:18,110
Without making promises you
don't know you can keep.

529
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,748
You have to talk to me, Murph.

530
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,377
I need to fix this before I go.

531
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,422
MURPH: Then I'll keep it
broken so you have to stay.

532
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:45,012
After you kids came along, your mom said
something to me I never quite understood.

533
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,014
She said, "Now..."

534
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:53,395
"we're just here to be
memories for our kids."

535
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,028
And I think that now
I understand what she meant.

536
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:08,535
Once you're a parent, you're
the ghost of your children's future.

537
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:12,331
You said ghosts didn't exist.

538
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,297
That's right, Murph.

539
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,843
Murph, look at me.

540
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,391
I can't be your ghost right now.

541
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,186
I need to exist.

542
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,731
They chose me.

543
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:42,403
Murph, they chose me. You saw.
You're the one who led me to them.

544
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,533
That's exactly why you can't go.

545
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,705
I figured out the message.

546
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:56,333
- One word. Know what it is?
- Murph.

547
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,835
"Stay."

548
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:01,088
- It says, "Stay," Dad.
- Murph.

549
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,507
You don't believe me.

550
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,468
Look at the books! Look
at this. It says, "Stay."

551
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,596
Why...? You're not
listening! It says, "Stay!"

552
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,765
No, I'm coming back.

553
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,267
When?

554
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,741
One for you, one for me.

555
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,286
When I'm up there
in hypersleep, or...

556
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,164
traveling near the speed
of light, or...

557
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,292
near a black hole...

558
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:43,297
time's gonna change for me.
It's gonna run more slowly.

559
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,675
When we get back...

560
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,219
we're gonna compare.

561
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,014
- MURPH: Time will run differently for us?
- Yeah.

562
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:57,770
By the time I get back, we might
even be the same age, you and me.

563
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,481
"What?" Imagine that!

564
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,195
Aw, Murph...

565
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,989
You have no idea when
you're coming back.

566
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:12,284
No idea at all!

567
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,539
Murph, don't... Don't
make me leave like this.

568
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,208
Come on, Murph!

569
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,044
Don't make me leave
like this, Murph!

570
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,677
Hey...

571
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:32,554
I love you.

572
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,848
Forever. You hear me?

573
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:38,519
I love you forever,
and I'm coming back.

574
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,651
I'm coming back.

575
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,046
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

576
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,257
Just fine.

577
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,848
I love you, Tom.

578
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,517
- Travel safe, huh?
- Yeah.

579
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,936
You look after our place
for me, all right?

580
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:22,729
- All right?
- Uh-huh.

581
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:30,612
- Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?
- You mean your truck?

582
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,740
I'll make sure
they bring it back.

583
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,661
Look after my kids, Donald!

584
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:53,760
TARS: Go for main engine
start. T-minus 10...

585
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,513
- Dad!
- Nine...

586
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:57,931
Dad!

587
00:41:58,558 --> 00:41:59,600
Eight...

588
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,019
seven...

589
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:03,437
Dad!

590
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,813
Six...

591
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:09,109
five, main engine start, four...

592
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:11,612
three...

593
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,405
two...

594
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:16,408
one. Booster ignition and...

595
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,337
All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.

596
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:35,469
Prepare for stage
one separation.

597
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:36,845
Stage one.

598
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,645
There is Mach 1.

599
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:49,316
Everybody good? Plenty
of slaves for my robot colony?

600
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:54,488
They gave him a humor setting so
he'd fit in better with his unit.

601
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,490
He thinks it relaxes us.

602
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:59,451
A giant sarcastic robot.

603
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:01,745
What a great idea!

604
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,623
TARS: I have a cue light I can
use when I'm joking if you like.

605
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:05,832
That'd probably help.

606
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,920
You can use it to find your way back
to the ship after I blow you out the airlock.

607
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,007
- What's your humor setting, TARS?
- That's 100 percent.

608
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,968
Let's bring it
on down to 75, please.

609
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,136
TARS: Stage two separation.

610
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,983
COOPER: All feeds
going manual.

611
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:32,693
MAN: Going manual.

612
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:37,155
COOPER: Deactivate probe
heater one, two and three.

613
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,365
MAN: Check.

614
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,873
- Taking control.
- TARS: This is handover to you.

615
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:53,005
- MAN: A.D.F. check.
- COOPER: Over.

616
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:57,009
Pull thrusters back. Fuel
cells one, two, three.

617
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,510
MAN: One hundred percent.

618
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,512
COOPER: Ex-mites.

619
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,315
It's hard leaving everything.

620
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:14,192
My kids. Your father.

621
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,195
We're going to be spending
a lot of time together.

622
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,407
- We should learn to talk.
- And when not to.

623
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,244
Just being honest.

624
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,747
I don't think you need
to be that honest.

625
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,583
Hey, TARS, what's your honesty
parameter?

626
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:32,377
- TARS: Ninety percent.
- Ninety percent?

627
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:35,589
Absolute honesty isn't always
the most diplomatic, nor the...

628
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:38,342
safest form of communication
with emotional beings.

Okay.

Ninety percent it is, Dr. Brand.

631
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:49,978
We are coming up on the Endurance.
Twelve minutes out.

632
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,081
Okay. Taking control.

633
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,420
Approaching module
port, 500 meters.

634
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:29,559
It's all you, Doyle.

635
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:50,580
Nice and easy, Doyle.
Nice and easy.

636
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,003
I feel good.

637

Never mind.

644
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,038

645
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,873

- Just a sec.

- Yeah.
- You all right?

660
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:53,930
Mm. Yeah, I just need a minute.

661
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,640
OK, I think we have some Dramamine
in the hab pod, I'm just gonna get that

662

- Yeah?

- Bring a lot.
- Heh-heh-heh.

666
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,705
- Give my regards to Dr. Mann.
- I will, Dad.

667
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,790
It looks good
for your trajectory.

668
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,294
We've calculated
two years to Saturn.

669
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:26,546
That's a lot of Dramamine.

670
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:29,716

will you, please, sir?

671
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:33,053
We'll be waiting for you

Rage, rage against the dying

Know dark is right.

We have each other.
Dr. Mann had it worse.

and we won't find another one like her.

No, it's not like looking
for a new condo.

The human race is going to be...

690
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:58,388
adrift...

691

desperate for a rock it can cling
to while it catches its breath.

692
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:04,477
We need to find that rock.

693
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:07,522
And our three prospects
are at the edge of what...

694
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,566
might sustain human life.

695

Laura Miller's planet is first.

696
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:14,821
- Laura started our biology program.
- COOPER: Mm-hm.

697
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:22,996
- AMELIA: Uh, Wolf Edmunds is here.
- Tell me about Edmunds.

698
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:26,583
Oh, uh, Wolf's a particle
physicist.

699
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:31,212
None of them had families, huh?

700
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:35,133
No. No attachments.
My father insisted.

701
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:38,845
They all knew the odds against ever
seeing another human being again.

702
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,973
I'm hoping we can surprise
at least three of them.

703
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,057
- How about Mann?
- Dr. Mann?

704
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,143
He's remarkable.
He's the best of us.

705
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:49,689
He inspired 11 people to follow him
on the loneliest journey in human history.

706
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,441
Scientists, explorers.

709
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,700
not evil.

710
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:02,744
You don't think
nature can be evil?

711
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,789
No. Formidable.
Frightening. But...

712
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:08,583
- no, not evil.
- Hm.

713
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:13,046
Is a lion evil because it
rips a gazelle to shreds?

714
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,548
Just what we take with us, then.

715
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,133
Yeah.

- I'll be there in a minute.

721

Just remember, Coop, you
are literally wasting your breath.

722

over that trajectory one more time.

Fourteen months to Saturn.

- Dr. Brand and Edmunds...
- Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.

Dr. Brand and Edmunds.
They close?

729
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:02,178
I wouldn't know.

730
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:05,348
Is that 90 percent "wouldn't know"
or 10 percent "wouldn't know"?

731
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:08,643
- I also have a discretion setting, Cooper.
- Aah.

down for the long nap.

you an update.

Why are you in my dad's truck?

He wanted me to bring
it for your brother.

747

He sent you a message.

with him for leaving.

get them to transmit it to Cooper.

Murph is a bright spark.

751

Maybe I should fan the flame.

752

She's already making
fools of her teachers.

753

So maybe she should come
and make a fool out of you.

- Heading for Mars.

the wormhole in about three hours.

786
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:45,586
Hey, Coop?

787
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,214
Can we stop the spinning?

788
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:49,465
Why?

789
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:51,968
Because we're close
enough to see it now?

790
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:54,929
All right.

791
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,180
Thanks.

792
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:03,896
There, that's it!
That's the wormhole!

793
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:05,857
Say it, don't spray it, Rom.

794
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:07,525
It's a sphere.

795
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:11,654
Of course it is. What, you...? You
thought it would just be a hole?

796
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:15,950
No, it's just that all the illustrations
I've ever seen, they...

797
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,579
ROMILLY: In the illustrations, they're
trying to show you how it works.

798
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:24,125
So they say you want to go
from here to there.

799
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:27,003
- But it's too far, right?
- Mm-hm.

800
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:31,966
So a wormhole bends space like this,
so you can take a shortcut through...

801
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:33,885
a higher dimension.

802
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,511
Okay, so...

803
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:39,765
to show that, they've turned three-dimensional
space into two dimensions...

804
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:43,895
which turns a wormhole
into two dimensions, a circle.

805
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:46,314
What's a circle
in three dimensions?

806
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,025
- A sphere.
- Exactly.

807
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:50,943
A spherical hole.

808
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:54,322
But who put it there? Who
do we have to thank?

809
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:59,410
I'm not thanking anybody until we get
out of here in one piece, Rom.

810
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:08,044
COOPER: Any trick
to this, Doyle?

811
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,047
No one knows.

812
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,847
The others made it, right?

813
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,559
At least some of them.

814
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:58,678

goodbye to our solar system?

We're passing through the bulk.

01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:45,224
It's space beyond our three dimensions.
All you can do is record and observe.

DOYLE: So the lost
communications came through.

830
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:12,103
- How?
- The relay on this side cached them.

831
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:15,815
So years of basic data.
No real surprises.

832
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:20,569
Miller's site has kept pinging
thumbs up, as has Dr. Mann's. Um...

833
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,863
Edmunds' went
down three years ago.

835
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:27,410
Maybe. He was sending the thumbs
up right until it went dark.

01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,337
But Miller's still looks
good though, right?

01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:31,789
- Because she's coming up fast.
- DOYLE: Mm-hm.

With one complication.

839
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:37,670
The planet is much closer
to Gargantua than we thought.

840
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:40,506
- COOPER: Gargantua?
- It's what we're calling the black hole.

841
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:42,967
Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets
both orbit it.

842
01:02:43,135 --> 01:02:46,345
- And Miller's is on the horizon?
- ROMILLY: As a basketball around a hoop.

843
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:48,514
Landing there takes
us dangerously close.

844
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:51,934
And a black hole that big has
a huge gravitational pull.

845
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:57,523
Look, I could swing around that neutron
star to decelerate.

846
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:59,567
AMELIA: No, it's not
that. It's time.

847
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:04,238
The gravity on that planet will slow
our clock compared to Earth's drastically.

848
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:06,031
How bad?

849

Well, we can't just drop
down there without...

Cooper, we have a mission.

855
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,384
Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission,
and our mission Plan A is...

856
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:28,721
to find a planet that can habitate
the people that are living on Earth now.

857
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:31,724
You can't just think about your family.
Now you have to think bigger.

858
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:35,102
I am thinking about my family
and millions of other families, okay?

859
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:39,523
Plan A does not work if the people on Earth
are dead by the time we pull it off.

860
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,485
No. It doesn't.

861
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,487
That's why there's a Plan B.

862
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:47,907
Okay. Cooper's right.

863
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:51,911
We need to think of time as a resource,
like oxygen and food. Going down will cost us.

864
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:55,456
All right, look.

865
01:03:56,750 --> 01:04:00,211
Dr. Mann's data is promising, but it
will take months to get there.

866
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:02,588
And Edmunds', it's even further.

867
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:06,926
Miller hasn't sent much, but what she has
is very promising. It's water, it's organics...

868
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,261
- You don't find that every day.
- No, you don't.

869
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:11,764
And just think about the resources,
including time...

870
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:14,433
that would be spent
trying to get back here.

871
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,353
- Romilly...
- Yeah?

872
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:21,357
How far off from Miller's planet do we have
to be to stay out of the time shift?

873
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:23,192
Just back from the cusp.

874
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,320
All right, which is here, just
outside of Miller's planet.

875
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:28,280
- ROMILLY: Right.
- Okay.

876
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,992
Here's Gargantua.
Here's Miller's planet.

877
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,329
Instead of taking the Endurance
into orbit around Miller's planet...

878
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:38,374
which would conserve fuel,
but we would lose a lot of time...

879
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:42,628
what if we take a wider orbit around Gargantua,
parallel with Miller's planet...

880
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:45,297
outside of this time
shift, to here?

881
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:48,259
Then we take the Ranger down,
we get Miller, we get her samples.

882
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:51,136
We come back, we analyze,
we debrief. We're in, we're out.

883
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:53,639
We lose a little fuel,
but we save a whole lot of time.

884
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:55,641
- That'll work.
- That's good.

885
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:58,269
There's no time for monkey
business or chit-chat down there.

886
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:01,230

definitely stay here.

Anyone else can stay.

an orbit of Gargantua.

891
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:17,288
Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting, but make
sure we stay in range of Miller's planet.

892
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,999

broken up by a wave

How's the wreckage stayed together
after all these years, huh?

995
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,408
Because of the time slippage.

On this planet's time,
she just landed hours ago.

can squeeze, but...

it can't run backwards.
It just can't.

- through gravity, right?
- Yes.

1016
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:32,819
Could they be talking
to us from the future?

1017
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:35,989
- Maybe.
- Okay. If they can...

1018
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:40,452
"They" are beings
of five dimensions.

1019
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:44,206
To them, time might be
another physical dimension.

1020
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,874
To them...

1021
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:50,462
the past might be a canyon that they can
climb into and the future...

1022

a mountain they can climb up.

01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:27,363
Grandpa died last week.

1095
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:30,867
We buried him out in the back
forty next to Mom and...

1096
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,827
Jesse.

1097
01:20:33,704 --> 01:20:36,789
Which is where we would have
buried you if you'd ever...

1098
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,042
come back.

1099
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:42,795
Murph was there at the funeral.

1100
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:46,174
We don't see her that much,
but she came for that.

1101
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:51,804
You aren't listening
to this, I know that.

All these messages
are just, like...

drifting out there
in the darkness.

1104

Lois says that, uh...

1105
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:09,489
I have to let you go.

1106
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,699
And, uh...

1107
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:13,284
so...

1108
01:21:16,539 --> 01:21:19,624
I guess I'm letting you go.

1109
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:23,253
I don't know where
you are, Dad...

1110
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:26,506
but I hope that you're at peace.

1111
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,384
Goodbye.

Hey, Dad.

Hey, Murph.

1114
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:50,321
You son of a bitch.

1115
01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:56,536
I never made one of these when
you were still responding...

1116
01:21:56,704 --> 01:21:59,038
because I was so mad
at you for leaving.

1117
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:04,168
And then when you
went quiet, it...

1118
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:09,632
seemed like I should live
with that decision. And I have.

1119
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:16,556
But today's my birthday.

1120
01:22:20,227 --> 01:22:23,396
And it's a special one,
because you told me...

1121
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:31,863
You once told me that when you came
back, we might be the same age.

1122
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:36,659
And today I'm the age
you were when you left.

1123
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:41,748
So it would be a real good
time for you to come back.

- MURPH: I haven't. I...

1131
01:23:13,614 --> 01:23:16,115
I just had something
I needed to get out.

1132

- I know they're still out there.
- I know.

1133
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:23,247
There are so many reasons their communications
might not be getting through.

1134
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:24,832
I know, professor.

1135
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:28,378
I'm not sure what I'm
more afraid of.

1136
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:31,881

coming back to find
we've failed.

- And?
- And that means...

1154
01:24:36,363 --> 01:24:40,825
each iteration is an attempt
to prove its own proof.

1155
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:43,119
It's recursive.
It's nonsensical.

finish it with one arm... No,

1166

We must reach far
beyond our own lifespans.

right where we needed her.

But the trip took years
longer than we anticipated.

We no longer have the fuel
to visit both prospects, so...

we have to choose.

But how?

They're both promising.

1175
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:55,399
Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann
is the one still transmitting, so...

1176
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:58,486
We've no reason to suspect
Edmunds' data would have soured.

1177

His world has key elements
to sustain human life.

1178

- As does Dr. Mann's.
- Cooper, this is my field.

1179
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:07,453
And...

1180
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:10,414
I really believe Edmunds'
is the better prospect.

Look at Miller's planet.
Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...

1183

the same thing on Mann's.

1184
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:25,763
Because of the black hole?

can happen will happen.

building block of evolution.

But when you're orbiting a black
hole not enough can happen.

1188
01:26:34,773 --> 01:26:39,068
It sucks in asteroids and comets, other
events which would otherwise reach you.

He's remarkable. We're
only here because of him.

And yet... Yet here he is.

1194
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,962
He's on the ground, and he's sending
a very unambiguous message, telling us...

1195
01:26:58,130 --> 01:26:59,839
to come to his planet.

01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:06,137
We should vote.

1198
01:27:06,305 --> 01:27:08,472
Well, if we vote, there's something
you should know.

Brand?

1200
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:12,476
He has a right to know.

- ROMILLY: Is that true?
- Yes.

to follow my heart.

to figure all this out with theory.

You're a scientist, Brand.

1207

So listen to me...

1208
01:27:37,794 --> 01:27:42,506
when I say that love isn't
something we invented. It's...

1209
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:45,843
observable, powerful.

1210
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:49,639
It has to mean something.

1211
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:54,185
Love has meaning, yes. Social utility,
social bonding, child rearing...

1212
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:57,855
We love people who have died.
Where's the social utility in that?

1213
01:27:58,398 --> 01:27:59,440
None.

1214
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:03,486
Maybe it means something
more, something we can't...

1215
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:05,696
yet understand.

1216
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:09,325
Maybe it's some evidence,
some...

1217
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:14,747
artifact of a higher dimension
that we can't consciously perceive.

1218
01:28:14,915 --> 01:28:19,710
I'm drawn across the universe to someone
I haven't seen in a decade...

1219
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:22,713
who I know is probably dead.

1220
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:26,384
Love is the one thing we're
capable of perceiving...

1221
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:29,387
that transcends dimensions
of time and space.

1222
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:35,559
Maybe we should trust that,
even if we can't understand it yet.

1223
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:42,233
All right, Cooper...

1224
01:28:44,111 --> 01:28:45,403
yes...

1225

Wolf again excites me.

01:43:27,159 --> 01:43:29,619
We can care deeply,
selflessly about...

1407
01:43:29,787 --> 01:43:33,290
those we know, but that empathy rarely
extends beyond our line of sight.

1408
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:35,166
But the lie.

1409
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:40,881
That monstrous lie?

1410
01:43:42,133 --> 01:43:43,425
Unforgivable.

1411
01:43:43,593 --> 01:43:45,051
And he knew that.

1412
01:43:45,803 --> 01:43:50,140
He was prepared to destroy his own humanity
in order to save the species.

1413
01:43:50,308 --> 01:43:52,726
- He made an incredible sacrifice.
- No.

1414
01:43:54,145 --> 01:43:59,024
An incredible sacrifice is being made
by the people on Earth who are gonna die!

1415
01:43:59,483 --> 01:44:01,651
Because in his fucking
arrogance...

1416
01:44:02,069 --> 01:44:04,154
he declared their case hopeless.

1417
01:44:04,822 --> 01:44:06,323
I'm sorry, Cooper...

1418
01:44:06,866 --> 01:44:08,325
their case is hopeless.

1419
01:44:08,492 --> 01:44:10,619
No. No.

1420
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:12,746
We are the future.

1421
01:44:16,417 --> 01:44:18,335
Cooper, what can I do?

1422
01:44:21,547 --> 01:44:23,381
Let me go home.

1423

MAN: You're
absolutely positive?

1424
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:29,012
His solution was correct.
He'd had it for years.

1425
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:32,307
- It's worthless?
- It's half the answer.

1426
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:36,269
Okay, how do you
find the other half?

1427
01:44:36,854 --> 01:44:38,521
Out there? A black hole.

1428
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:41,524
- But stuck down here on Earth?
- Yeah?

1429
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:44,527
I'm not sure you can.

1430
01:44:46,447 --> 01:44:49,115

pack up and leave.

1431
01:44:50,534 --> 01:44:52,619
What are they hoping to find?

1432
01:44:53,204 --> 01:44:54,245
Survival.

1433
01:45:02,046 --> 01:45:03,129
Damn it.

1434
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:09,844
Murph, don't...? Don't
people have a right to know?

1435
01:45:10,471 --> 01:45:14,557
Panic won't help. We just have
to keep working, same as ever.

1436
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:18,061
But isn't that exactly what Professor Brand
was manipulating us to do?

1437
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:21,481
Brand gave up on us. I'm
still trying to solve this.

1438
01:45:22,108 --> 01:45:23,191
So...

1439
01:45:24,610 --> 01:45:26,277
do you have an idea?

1440
01:45:26,988 --> 01:45:28,321
A feeling.

1441
01:45:31,742 --> 01:45:33,743
I told you about my ghost.

1442
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:37,789
My dad thought
I called it a ghost...

1443
01:45:38,249 --> 01:45:39,916
because I was scared of it.

1444
01:45:43,379 --> 01:45:44,713
But I was never scared of it.

1445
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:49,592
I called it a ghost
because it felt...

1446
01:45:52,013 --> 01:45:53,680
It felt like a person.

1447
01:45:56,225 --> 01:45:57,892
It was trying to tell
me something.

1448
01:46:00,855 --> 01:46:03,857
If there's an answer here
on Earth, it's back there...

1449
01:46:04,316 --> 01:46:06,234
somehow, in that room.

1450
01:46:06,777 --> 01:46:08,528
So I have to find it.

1451
01:46:11,949 --> 01:46:13,700
We're running out of time.

1452

oxygen scrubbers?

1453
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:19,956
COOPER: No, they can stay.
I'll be sleeping anyway.

1454
01:46:20,124 --> 01:46:21,708
- Hey, Coop?
- Yeah?

1455
01:46:21,876 --> 01:46:23,877
I have a suggestion
for your return journey.

1456
01:46:24,045 --> 01:46:26,796
- Yeah, what's that?
- Have one last crack at the black hole.

1457
01:46:28,674 --> 01:46:30,258
I'm going home, Rom.

1458
01:46:30,426 --> 01:46:33,678
Yeah, I know. This isn't
going to cost you any time.

1459
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:36,264
There's a chance
for the people on Earth.

1460
01:46:37,016 --> 01:46:40,060
- Talk to me.
- Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.

1461
01:46:40,227 --> 01:46:44,105
- It's what we call a gentle singularity.
- Gentle?

1462
01:46:44,273 --> 01:46:47,734
They're hardly gentle. But the tidal
gravity is so quick that...

1463
01:46:47,902 --> 01:46:52,155
something crossing the horizon
fast might survive. A probe, say.

1464
01:46:52,323 --> 01:46:56,993
- What happens after it crosses?
- After the horizon is a complete mystery.

1465
01:46:57,161 --> 01:47:00,246
So, what's to say there isn't
some way that the probe...

1466
01:47:00,414 --> 01:47:03,333
can glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

1467
01:47:03,501 --> 01:47:06,753
If he's equipped to transmit
every form of energy that can pulse.

1468
01:47:06,921 --> 01:47:09,714
TARS: Just when did this probe
become a "he," professor?

1469
01:47:10,257 --> 01:47:12,008
TARS is the obvious candidate.

1470
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:14,761
I've already told him
what to look for.

1471
01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:17,639
I'd need the old optical
transmitter off KIPP, Cooper.

1472
01:47:17,807 --> 01:47:19,140
You'd do this for us?

1473
01:47:19,308 --> 01:47:23,228
Before you get all teary, remember
that as a robot I have to do anything you say.

1474
01:47:24,146 --> 01:47:25,605
Your cue light's broken.

1475
01:47:25,773 --> 01:47:27,315
I'm not joking.

1476
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:33,196
I'll need TARS to remove and adapt
some components from KIPP.

1477
01:47:33,364 --> 01:47:35,698
I don't want to disturb
his archival functions.

1478
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:37,367
I'll supervise.

1479
01:47:37,701 --> 01:47:38,743
All right.

1480
01:47:38,911 --> 01:47:43,581
Dr. Mann, we need to find three secure
sites. One for Brand's lab, two for habitat.

1481
01:47:43,749 --> 01:47:46,209
Once those modules have landed,
you don't want to move them.

1482
01:47:46,377 --> 01:47:48,920
I can take you to the probe
sites, but I don't think...

1483
01:47:49,088 --> 01:47:51,798
these conditions will hold.
I think we should wait.

1484
01:47:51,966 --> 01:47:54,801
COOPER: CASE is headed down with the rest
of the distillery equipment.

1485
01:47:54,969 --> 01:47:57,804
I'd really like to secure
those sites by nightfall.

1486
01:47:59,723 --> 01:48:02,809
Well, these squalls
do usually blow over.

1487
01:48:03,227 --> 01:48:04,352
Okay, then.

1488
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:06,729
- You'll need a long-range transmitter.
- Got it.

1489
01:48:06,897 --> 01:48:08,439

- Yeah.

Follow me.

1491
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:13,027
TARS, 72 hours, yeah?

1492
01:48:13,195 --> 01:48:14,404
Roger that, Cooper.

1493

feel you have to go back.

But I'd be remiss if I didn't
at least mention...

1495
01:48:28,669 --> 01:48:32,839
that a mission such as ours could
certainly use an extra engineer.

1496

You better slow down, turbo.
Safety first, CASE, remember.

Okay. The navigational hub has

We don't have enough life support
to make it back to Earth...

Not enough. But I have a plan.

us down close to her horizon.

now, Dr. Brand.

1765
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:48,061
I'm sorry, Cooper.

1766
02:13:51,190 --> 02:13:54,442
COOPER: Once we've gathered
enough speed around Gargantua...

1767
02:13:54,777 --> 02:13:56,611
we use Lander 1...

1768
02:13:57,113 --> 02:13:59,406
and Ranger 2 as rocket
boosters to...

1769
02:14:00,574 --> 02:14:02,575
push us out of the black
hole's gravity.

1770
02:14:04,912 --> 02:14:07,580
The Lander's linkages
have been destroyed...

1771
02:14:07,748 --> 02:14:10,083
so we'll have
to control manually.

1772
02:14:11,293 --> 02:14:14,754
Once Lander 1 is spent,
TARS will detach...

TARS: And get sucked
into that black hole.

1774
02:14:17,258 --> 02:14:19,217
AMELIA: Why does
TARS have to detach?

1775
02:14:19,385 --> 02:14:21,428
We have to shed the weight
to escape the gravity.

is to leave something behind.

TARS to do this for us.

They saved us.

Yeah? Who the hell is "they"? And
just why would they want to help us?

1905
02:27:08,487 --> 02:27:11,197
I don't know, but they constructed
this three-dimensional space...

02:27:11,364 --> 02:27:14,658
inside their five-dimensional reality
to allow you to understand it.

Yeah, that ain't working.

1908
02:27:16,953 --> 02:27:18,496
Yes, it is.

1909
02:27:18,663 --> 02:27:22,541
You've seen that time is represented
here as a physical dimension.

1910
02:27:22,709 --> 02:27:25,544
You have worked out that you can
exert a force across space-time.

I am transmitting it on all wavelengths,
but nothing is getting out, Cooper.

I can do this. I can do this.

understand its significance for years.

1926
02:28:14,261 --> 02:28:15,719
I get that, TARS.

out or the people on Earth are gonna die. Think!

02:28:22,477 --> 02:28:24,979
they didn't bring us
here to change the past.

They didn't bring us
here to change the past.

No, they didn't bring
us here at all.

get it yet, TARS?

1939
02:29:34,841 --> 02:29:36,634
I brought myself here!

1940
02:29:37,510 --> 02:29:41,013
We're here to communicate
with the three-dimensional world.

1941
02:29:41,431 --> 02:29:42,931
We're the bridge!

1942
02:29:50,940 --> 02:29:52,733
I thought they chose me.

1943
02:29:56,071 --> 02:29:59,740
- But they didn't choose me, they chose
her. TARS: For what, Cooper?

1944
02:30:02,243 --> 02:30:03,911
To save the world.

1945
02:30:08,208 --> 02:30:12,586
All of this is one little girl's bedroom.
Every moment.

1946
02:30:12,921 --> 02:30:14,338
It's infinitely complex.

1947
02:30:14,506 --> 02:30:19,259
They have access to infinite time and space,
but they're not bound by anything!

1948
02:30:19,427 --> 02:30:24,098
They can't find a specific place
in time. They can't communicate.

1949
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:28,602
That's why I'm here. I'm gonna
find a way to tell Murph...

1950
02:30:28,770 --> 02:30:30,270
just like I found this moment.

1951
02:30:30,438 --> 02:30:32,773
- How, Cooper?
- Love, TARS, love.

1952
02:30:32,941 --> 02:30:37,361
It's just like Brand said. My connection
with Murph, it is quantifiable. It's the key!

1953
02:30:37,529 --> 02:30:39,405
What are we here to do?

1954
02:30:40,323 --> 02:30:42,199
Find how to tell her.

of the second hand.

into Morse and feed it to me.

Translating data to Morse. Cooper,
what if she never came back for it?

1961
02:31:11,604 --> 02:31:14,273
She will. She will.

WOMAN 1 ON TV: It was just constant.
Just that steady blow of dirt.

2032
02:37:35,947 --> 02:37:38,865
Of course, I didn't speak
to her personally.

2033
02:37:39,033 --> 02:37:41,034
MAN 1: We always set
the plate upside-down.

2034
02:37:41,202 --> 02:37:43,954
Glasses or cups, whatever
it was, upside-down.

2035
02:37:44,122 --> 02:37:49,042
Well, my dad was a farmer. Uh,
like everybody else back then.

2036
02:37:49,210 --> 02:37:51,670
There just wasn't enough food.

2037
02:37:51,838 --> 02:37:54,548
WOMAN 2: We wore little things,
little strips...

2038
02:37:54,715 --> 02:37:59,886
of sheet over our nose and mouth so
we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

2039
02:38:00,054 --> 02:38:03,515
Well, it was pretty exciting
for me because it was hope.

2040
02:38:03,683 --> 02:38:07,894
MAN 2: I don't care who describes it, there is no
way for it to be exaggerated. It was that bad.

2041
02:38:08,062 --> 02:38:11,731
MAN: She did confirm just
how much you loved farming.

2042
02:38:12,066 --> 02:38:13,733
- Oh, she did, did she?
- Yeah.

2043
02:38:13,901 --> 02:38:15,110
Come here.

2044
02:38:15,695 --> 02:38:20,657
Home sweet home. Everything
replaced and put back where it...

2045
02:38:20,825 --> 02:38:22,909
(INTERVIEWEES CONTINUE
SPEAKING IN BACKGROUND)

2046
02:38:27,039 --> 02:38:29,082
- Hey, is this...?
- Oh, yeah.

2047
02:38:29,250 --> 02:38:32,252
The machine we found out near Saturn
when we found you. Yes.

2048
02:38:32,420 --> 02:38:35,088
Its, uh, power source was shot,
but we could get you another one.

2049
02:38:35,256 --> 02:38:37,424
Yes. Please.

2050
02:38:38,634 --> 02:38:39,968
TARS: Settings.

2051
02:38:40,428 --> 02:38:41,928
General settings.

2052
02:38:42,430 --> 02:38:44,264
Security settings.

2053
02:38:46,976 --> 02:38:49,269
Honesty, new setting:

2054
02:38:50,438 --> 02:38:52,063
95 percent.

2055
02:38:52,398 --> 02:38:54,900
Confirmed. Additional
customization?

2056
02:38:55,776 --> 02:38:56,902
Humor:

2057
02:38:58,404 --> 02:38:59,905
75 percent.

2058
02:39:00,281 --> 02:39:01,615
Confirmed.

2059
02:39:02,283 --> 02:39:05,410
Auto self-destruct
T-minus 10, nine...

2060
02:39:05,578 --> 02:39:07,495
Let's make that 60 percent.

2061
02:39:09,790 --> 02:39:11,917
Sixty percent confirmed.

2062
02:39:12,543 --> 02:39:15,629
- Knock-knock.
- You want 55?

2063
02:39:20,509 --> 02:39:22,636
Is this really what it was like?

2064
02:39:24,847 --> 02:39:27,265
It was never this
clean, Slick. Heh.

2065
02:39:31,771 --> 02:39:35,440
I don't care much for this pretending
we're back where we started.

2066
02:39:37,526 --> 02:39:39,819
I want to know where we are.

2067
02:39:41,447 --> 02:39:42,989
Where we're going.

2068
02:39:47,536 --> 02:39:50,622
- Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there.
- Yeah.

2069
02:39:50,790 --> 02:39:51,873
Family?

2070
02:39:52,041 --> 02:39:55,919
Yeah, they all came out to see her.
She's been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.

2071
02:40:12,478 --> 02:40:14,271
(FAMILY EXITS ROOM)

2072
02:40:28,995 --> 02:40:30,870
You told them I like farming.

2073
02:40:31,038 --> 02:40:32,706
(BOTH LAUGH)

2074
02:40:36,836 --> 02:40:38,503
It was me, Murph.

2075
02:40:40,965 --> 02:40:42,757
I was your ghost.

2076
02:40:44,051 --> 02:40:45,677
I know.

2077
02:40:47,471 --> 02:40:52,183
People didn't believe me. They thought
that I was doing it all myself.

2078
02:40:52,351 --> 02:40:53,393
But...

2079
02:40:56,272 --> 02:40:58,231
I knew who it was.

2080
02:41:03,195 --> 02:41:05,363
Nobody believed me.

2081
02:41:05,865 --> 02:41:08,283
But I knew you'd come back.

2082
02:41:10,870 --> 02:41:12,078
How?

2083
02:41:14,081 --> 02:41:17,208
Because my dad promised me.

2084
02:41:23,257 --> 02:41:25,258
Well, I'm here now, Murph.

2085
02:41:26,552 --> 02:41:27,886
I'm here.

2086
02:41:29,347 --> 02:41:30,680
No.

2087
02:41:32,767 --> 02:41:36,895
No parent should have
to watch their own child die.

2088
02:41:39,815 --> 02:41:42,484
I have my kids here for me now.

2089
02:41:45,279 --> 02:41:46,780
You go.

2090
02:41:49,700 --> 02:41:51,201
Where?

2091
02:41:54,705 --> 02:41:56,289
Brand.

2092
02:42:06,133 --> 02:42:07,759
MURPH: She's out there...

2093
02:42:14,183 --> 02:42:15,934
setting up camp.

2094
02:42:42,420 --> 02:42:44,129
Alone...

2095
02:42:45,297 --> 02:42:47,966
in a strange galaxy.

2096
02:42:58,853 --> 02:43:03,523
Maybe right now she's settling
in for the long nap...

2097
02:43:21,876 --> 02:43:24,711
by the light of our new sun...

2098
02:43:40,186 --> 02:43:42,228
in our new home.

2099
