1
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,189
Hello.

2
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,821
My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.

3
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,412
Do you want a chocolate?

4
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:36,418
I could eat about
a million and a half of these.

5
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:42,804
My mama always said
life was like a box of chocolates.

6
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,676
You never know what you're gonna get.

7
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,439
Those must be comfortable shoes.

8
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:03,487
I'll bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that and not feel a thing.

9
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,162
I wish I had shoes like that.

10
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
My feet hurt.

11
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,247
Mama always said there's an awful lot

12
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,545
you could tell about a person
by their shoes:

13
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,633
where they're going,
where they've been.

14
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,930
I've worn lots of shoes.

15
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:37,855
I bet if I think about it real hard,
I could remember my first pair of shoes.

16
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,398
Mama said they'd take me anywhere.

17
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,818
<i>She said they was my magic shoes.</i>

18
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:50,076
All right, Forrest,
you can open your eyes now.

19
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,838
Let's take a little walk around.

20
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,427
How do those feel?

21
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,556
His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,

22
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,139
as strong as I've ever seen,

23
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:19,601
but his back is as crooked
as a politician.

24
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,988
But we're gonna straighten him right up,
now, aren't we, Forrest?

25
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,190
Forrest!

26
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,908
<i>Now, when I was a baby,</i>

27
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,828
<i>Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero,</i>

28
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,327
<i>General Nathan Bedford Forrest.</i>

29
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,624
<i>She said we was related to him
in some way.</i>

30
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,076
<i>And what he did was,</i>

31
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,414
<i>he started up this club called
the Ku Klux Klan.</i>

32
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,842
<i>They'd all dress up in theirrobes
and their bed sheets</i>

33
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:49,263
<i>and act like a bunch of ghosts
or spooks or something.</i>

34
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,218
<i>They'd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around.</i>

35
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,349
<i>And anyway, that's how I got my name,</i>

36
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,850
<i>Forrest Gump.</i>

37
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,682
<i>Mama said that the "Forrest" part</i>

38
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:03,315
<i>was to remind me that sometimes
we all do things that,</i>

39
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:06,193
<i>well, just don't make no sense.</i>

40
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,365
Okay... Get it, get it...

41
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,417
Wait, is it this way? Hold on.

42
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,828
All right...

43
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,085
What are you all staring at?

44
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:27,635
Haven't you ever seen a little boy
with braces on his legs before?

45
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,890
Don't ever let anybody tell you
they're better than you, Forrest.

46
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,559
If God intended
everybody to be the same,

47
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,762
he'd have given us all braces
on our legs.

48
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:41,645
<i>Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.</i>

49
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,604
<i>We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,</i>

50
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,736
<i>about a half mile from
the town of Greenbow, Alabama.</i>

51
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,569
<i>That's in the county of Greenbow.</i>

52
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:57,077
<i>Our house had been in Mama's family
since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa</i>

53
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,079
<i>had come across the ocean
about 1,000 years ago,</i>

54
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,081
<i>something like that.</i>

55
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,879
<i>Since it was just me and Mama
and we had all these empty rooms,</i>

56
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,708
<i>Mama decided to let those rooms out,</i>

57
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,758
<i>mostly to people passing through,</i>

58
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:12,805
<i>like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.</i>

59
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,599
<i>That's how me and Mama got money.</i>

60
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,428
<i>Mama was a real smart lady.</i>

61
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:23,516
Remember what I told you, Forrest.
You're no different than anybody else is.

62
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,396
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?

63
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,655
You're the same as everybody else.
You are no different.

64
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:37,622
Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump.

65
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,915
Now, his IQ is 75.

66
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,828
Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock.

67
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,462
<i>She wanted me to have
the finest education,</i>

68
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,466
<i>so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.</i>

69
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,798
<i>I met the principal and all.</i>

70
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,177
I want to show you something,
Mrs. Gump.

71
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,514
Now, this is normal.

72
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,313
Forrest is right here.

73
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:12,694
The state requires a minimum IQ of
80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump.

74
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,069
He's gonna have to go
to a special school.

75
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,279
Now, he'll be just fine.

76
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,165
What does "normal" mean, anyway?

77
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:24,619
He might be a bit on the slow side,

78
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,496
but my boy Forrest is gonna get

79
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,128
the same opportunities
as everyone else.

80
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:34,007
He's not going to some special school
to learn how to re-tread tires.

81
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:37,261
We're talking about
five little points here.

82
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,594
There must be something can be done.

83
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,647
We're a progressive school system.

84
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,397
We don't want to see anybody
left behind.

85
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,739
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

86
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,861
He's on vacation.

87
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:20,136
Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.

88
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,106
You don't say much, do you?

89
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,578
"Finally, he had to try.

90
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,621
"It looked easy, but,

91
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,167
"oh, what happened.

92
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,246
- "First, there..."
- Mama, what's "vacation" mean?

93
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,382
- Vacation?
- Where Daddy went.

94
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,720
Vacation's when you go somewhere

95
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,434
and you don't ever come back.

96
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:11,563
<i>Anyway, I guess you could say
me and Mama was on our own.</i>

97
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,398
<i>But we didn't mind.
Our house was never empty.</i>

98
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,074
<i>There was always folks
coming and going.</i>

99
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,241
Supper.

100
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,742
- It's supper, everyone. Forrest...
- My, my. That sure looks special.

101
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:26,370
<i>Sometimes we had
so many people staying with us</i>

102
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,122
<i>that every room
was filled with travelers.</i>

103
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:32,831
<i>You know, folks living out
of their suitcases</i>

104
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,883
<i>and hat cases and sample cases.</i>

105
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,383
Forrest Gump, it's suppertime!
Forrest...

106
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,010
<i>One time, a young man
was staying with us,</i>

107
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,719
<i>and he had him a guitar case.</i>

108
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:03,695
Forrest! I told you not to bother
this nice young man.

109
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,120
Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am.

110
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,040
I was just showing him a thing or two
on the guitar here.

111
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:11,085
All right, but your supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.

112
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:14,130
Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.

113
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,383
Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you just did there.

114
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,335
Slow it down some.

115
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,385
<i>I liked that guitar.</i>

116
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,800
<i>It sounded good.</i>

117
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:32,770
<i>I started moving around to the music,</i>

118
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,691
<i>swinging my hips.</i>

119
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,818
<i>This one night,
me and Mama was out shopping,</i>

120
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,901
<i>and we walked right by
Benson's furniture and appliance store,</i>

121
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,576
<i>and guess what?</i>

122
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,759
This is not for children's eyes.

123
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,092
<i>Some years later,
that handsome young man</i>

124
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,720
<i>who they called "The King,"</i>

125
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,142
<i>well, he'd sung too many songs,</i>

126
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,350
<i>had himself a heart attack,
or something.</i>

127
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,603
Must be hard being a king.

128
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,946
You know, it's funny how you remember
some things, but some things you can't.

129
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:27,362
- You do your very best now, Forrest.
- I sure will, Mama.

130
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:33,668
<i>I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school very well.</i>

131
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,922
Are you coming along?

132
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,501
Mama said not to be taking
rides from strangers.

133
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,757
This is the bus to school.

134
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,967
I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

135
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:54,931
- I'm Dorothy Harris.
- Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.

136
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,741
This seat's taken.

137
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,699
It's taken!

138
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,458
You can't sit here.

139
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,052
<i>You know, it's funny what
a young man recollects,</i>

140
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,509
<i>'cause I don't remember being born.</i>

141
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,308
I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,

142
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,482
and I don't know when I went
on my first outdoor picnic.

143
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:43,279
But I do remember the first time I heard

144
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,198
the sweetest voice in the wide world.

145
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:49,068
You can sit here if you want.

146
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:55,867
<i>I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.</i>

147
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,669
<i>She was like an angel.</i>

148
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,668
Well, are you gonna sit down,
or aren't you?

149
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,424
What's wrong with your legs?

150
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:12,758
Nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy.

151
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,848
<i>I just sat next to her on that bus</i>

152
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,021
<i>and had a conversation
all the way to school.</i>

153
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,815
...my back's crooked like
a question mark.

154
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,063
These are going to make me...

155
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:26,898
<i>And next to Mama, no one ever
talked to me or asked me questions.</i>

156
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,407
Are you stupid or something?

157
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,487
Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does."

158
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,787
- I'm Jenny.
- I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

159
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,293
<i>From that day on,
we was always together.</i>

160
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,214
<i>Jenny and me was like
peas and carrots.</i>

161
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,419
<i>She taught me how to climb.</i>

162
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:51,221
Come on, Forrest, you can do it.

163
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,924
<i>I showed her how to dangle.</i>

164
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,055
"...a good little monkey and..."

165
00:14:56,145 --> 00:15:01,061
<i>She helped me learn how to read,
and I showed her how to swing.</i>

166
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:07,147
<i>Sometimes we'd just sit out
and wait for the stars.</i>

167
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,156
- Mama's gonna worry about me.
- Just stay a little longer.

168
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:17,157
<i>For some reason,
Jenny didn't never want to go home.</i>

169
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,333
Okay, Jenny, I'll stay.

170
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,912
<i>She was my most special friend.</i>

171
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,004
My only friend.

172
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:35,595
Now, my mama always told me that
miracles happen every day.

173
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,052
Some people don't think so, but they do.

174
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,689
Hey, dummy!

175
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,734
Are you retarded, or just plain stupid?

176
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,313
- "Look, I'm Forrest Gimp."
- Just run away, Forrest.

177
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,742
Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry!

178
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:57,071
- Get the bikes!
- Hurry up! Let's get him!

179
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,703
- Come on!
- Look out, dummy, here we come!

180
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,624
We're gonna get you!

181
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:06,331
Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest!

182
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,962
Come back here, you!

183
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:26,066
Run, Forrest!

184
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,563
Run!

185
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,636
<i>Now, you wouldn't believe it
if I told you,</i>

186
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,264
but I can run like the wind blows.

187
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,612
From that day on,
if I was going somewhere,

188
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,734
I was running!

189
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,191
He's getting away! Stop him!

190
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,643
That boy sure is a running fool.

191
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,231
<i>Now, remember how I told you that</i>

192
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,238
<i>Jenny never seemed
to want to go home?</i>

193
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,412
<i>Well, she lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama.</i>

194
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,660
<i>Her mama had gone up to heaven
when she was five,</i>

195
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,084
<i>and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer.</i>

196
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:10,958
Jenny?

197
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,210
<i>He was a very loving man.</i>

198
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:17,920
<i>He was always kissing and touching
her and her sisters.</i>

199
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:24,097
<i>And then this one time,
Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school.</i>

200
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,139
Jenny, why didn't you come
to school today?

201
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,269
Daddy's taking a nap.

202
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,066
- Jenny!
- Come on!

203
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,067
Jenny, where'd you run to?

204
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,071
You'd better get back here, girl!

205
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,199
Where you at?

206
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,873
Jenny! Jenny! Where you at?

207
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,214
Jenny!

208
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,259
Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.

209
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,502
Jenny!

210
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,805
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

211
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,632
far, far away from here.

212
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:07,390
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

213
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,596
far, far away from here.

214
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,769
<i>Mama always said
that God is mysterious.</i>

215
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,017
Jenny!

216
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,443
<i>He didn't turn Jenny into a bird that day.</i>

217
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,652
You'd better get back here!

218
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,230
<i>Instead,</i>

219
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:23,448
<i>he had the police say Jenny didn't
have to stay in that house no more.</i>

220
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:27,623
<i>She went to live with her grandma
just over on Creekmore Avenue,</i>

221
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,914
<i>which made me happy,
'cause she was so close.</i>

222
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:38,547
<i>Some nights, Jenny would sneak out
and come on over to my house,</i>

223
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,754
<i>just 'cause she said she was scared.</i>

224
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,305
<i>Scared of what, I don't know,</i>

225
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,642
<i>but I think it was her grandma's dog.</i>

226
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,511
<i>He was a mean dog.</i>

227
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,980
<i>Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends</i>

228
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,467
<i>all the way up through high school.</i>

229
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,357
- Hey, stupid!
- Quit it!

230
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,777
- Run, Forrest, run!
- Hey,

231
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:03,950
did you hear me, stupid?

232
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,305
- Run, Forrest!
- Come on, get in the truck!

233
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,446
Get in the truck! Let's move it!

234
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,283
Come on, he's getting away! Move it!

235
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,538
Run, Forrest! Run!

236
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:16,167
- You better be running, stupid!
- Come on, dummy!

237
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,627
- Haul ass, dummy!
- Yeah, you better get running!

238
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,302
Jack rabbit!

239
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:35,975
Yeah!

240
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,981
Go! Go! Go!

241
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,314
Run, Forrest!

242
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,911
Now, it used to be,
I ran to get where I was going,

243
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,991
I never thought it would
take me anywhere.

244
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:26,196
- Who in the hell is that?
- That there is Forrest Gump, Coach.

245
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,035
Just a local idiot.

246
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,198
<i>And can you believe it?
I got to go to college, too.</i>

247
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,416
Forrest! Forrest! Run!

248
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,133
- Okay!
- Run!

249
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,759
Run, you stupid son of a bitch! Run!

250
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,774
You son of a bitch! Run! Go! Run!

251
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,900
No! Turn! Go!

252
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,748
He must be the stupidest
son of a bitch alive,

253
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,754
but he sure is fast!

254
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:32,758
<i>Now, maybe it's just me,
but college was very confusing times.</i>

255
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,015
<i>Federal troops enforcing a court order</i>

256
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:39,098
<i>integrated the University
of Alabama today.</i>

257
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,398
<i>Two negroes were admitted,</i>

258
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,773
<i>but only after Governor George Wallace
had carried out his symbolic threat</i>

259
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,399
<i>to stand in the school house door.</i>

260
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:50,154
<i>Governor Wallace,
I take it from that statement, that...</i>

261
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,278
Earl, what's going on?

262
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,705
- Coons are trying to get into school.
- Coons?

263
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,471
When raccoons try to get
on our back porch,

264
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,330
Mama just chase them off with a broom.

265
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:03,956
Not raccoons, you idiot, niggers,
and they want to go to school with us.

266
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,503
With us? They do?

267
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,961
<i>Shortly after Governor Wallace
had carried out his promise</i>

268
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,262
<i>to block the doorway,</i>

269
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,308
<i>President Kennedy
ordered the Secretary of Defense</i>

270
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,384
<i>then to use military force.</i>

271
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,185
<i>Here, by videotape,
is the encounter by General Graham,</i>

272
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:21,557
<i>commander of the National Guard,
and Governor Wallace.</i>

273
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,360
<i>...because these National Guardsmen
are here today</i>

274
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,984
<i>as federal soldiers for Alabamans.</i>

275
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,987
<i>They live within our borders,
they are all our brothers.</i>

276
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,490
<i>We are winning in this fight,</i>

277
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,573
<i>because we are awakening
the American people</i>

278
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:41,000
<i>to the dangers that we have spoken
about so many times,</i>

279
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:47,378
<i>just so evident today, the trend towards
military dictatorship in this country.</i>

280
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,304
<i>And so, at day's end,
the University of Alabama</i>

281
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,677
<i>in Tuscaloosa had been desegregated</i>

282
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:58,761
<i>and students Jimmy Hood
and Vivian Malone</i>

283
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,938
<i>had been signed up
for summer classes.</i>

284
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,360
<i>Ma'am, you dropped your book.
Ma'am...</i>

285
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,862
<i>Governor Wallace did what
he promised to do.</i>

286
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:13,488
<i>By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,
he kept the mob from gathering...</i>

287
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,694
Say, wasn't that Gump?

288
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:19,873
- Nah, that couldn't be.
- It sure as hell was.

289
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,462
<i>A few years later, that angry little man</i>

290
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,040
<i>at the school house door
thought it would be a good idea</i>

291
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,296
<i>and ran for president.</i>

292
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,053
<i>But somebody thought that it wasn't.</i>

293
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:40,806
But he didn't die.

294
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,063
My bus is here.

295
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:50,896
- Is it the number nine?
- No, it's the number four.

296
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,069
It was nice talking to you.

297
00:24:56,996 --> 00:25:01,081
I remember when that happened,
when Wallace got shot.

298
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,416
I was in college.

299
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,742
Did you go to a girls' college,

300
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,627
or to a girls-and-boys-together college?

301
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:07,755
It was co-ed.

302
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,548
'Cause Jenny went to a college
I couldn't go to.

303
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,967
It was a college just for girls.

304
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:16,259
<i>But I'd go and visit her
every chance I got.</i>

305
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,373
That hurts.

306
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,553
Forrest! Forrest!

307
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,725
- Forrest, stop it! Stop it!
- Jesus!

308
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:07,931
What are you doing?

309
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,794
- He was hurting you.
- What the hell is going on here?

310
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:13,482
- No, he's not! Get over there!
- Who is that? Who is that?

311
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,716
- Billy, I'm sorry.
- What the hell?

312
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,323
- Just get away from me!
- Don't...

313
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,368
- Don't go! Billy, wait a second!
- Get away from me.

314
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,658
He doesn't know any better!

315
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,079
Forrest, why did you do that?

316
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:33,006
I brought you some chocolate.

317
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,090
I'm sorry.

318
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,551
- I'll go back to my college now.
- Forrest...

319
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,851
Look at you.

320
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,023
Come on. Come on.

321
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,399
Is this your room?

322
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,114
Do you ever dream, Forrest,

323
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,293
about who you're gonna be?

324
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,166
- Who I'm gonna be?
- Yeah.

325
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,122
Aren't I going to be me?

326
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:17,880
Well, you'll always be you,
just another kind of you.

327
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:22,047
You know? I want to be famous.

328
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,555
I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.

329
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,889
I just want to be on an empty stage

330
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,270
with my guitar, my voice.

331
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,569
Just me.

332
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:41,407
And I want to reach people
on the personal level.

333
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,413
I want to be able to say things,
just one-to-one.

334
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,791
Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?

335
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:03,096
I sit next to them in my Home
Economics class all the time.

336
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,457
- I'm... Sorry.
- It's okay.

337
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,720
It's all right.

338
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,721
- It's okay.
- Oh, I'm dizzy.

339
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,146
I bet that never happened in Home Ec.

340
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,155
No.

341
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:16,495
I think I ruined
your roommate's bathrobe.

342
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,625
I don't care. I don't like her, anyway.

343
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:22,083
Run! Run! Run!

344
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:26,672
- Run! Run! Run!
- Run! Run! Run!

345
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:38,816
<i>College ran by real fast,
'cause I played so much football.</i>

346
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:42,145
<i>They even put me on a thing
called the All-America Team,</i>

347
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:46,028
<i>where you get to meet
the President of the United States.</i>

348
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,718
<i>President Kennedy met
with the Collegiate</i>

349
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,370
<i>All-American Football Team
at the Oval Office today.</i>

350
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,949
<i>Now, the really good thing
about meeting</i>

351
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,831
<i>the President of the United States
is the food.</i>

352
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,629
<i>They put you in this little room
with just about anything</i>

353
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:03,208
<i>you'd want to eat or drink.</i>

354
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:07,178
<i>And since, number one,
I wasn't hungry, but thirsty,</i>

355
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,927
<i>and number two, they was free,</i>

356
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:13,096
<i>I must have drank me about
15 Dr. Peppers.</i>

357
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,251
<i>Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?</i>

358
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,016
<i>It's an honor, sir.</i>

359
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,255
<i>Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?</i>

360
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,895
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

361
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,153
<i>Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?</i>

362
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,983
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

363
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:32,741
<i>- Congratulations. How do you feel?
- I gotta pee.</i>

364
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,702
<i>I believe he said he had to "go pee."</i>

365
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,800
<i>Sometime later,
for no particular reason,</i>

366
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,302
<i>somebody shot that
nice young President,</i>

367
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:58,805
<i>when he was riding in his car.</i>

368
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:03,560
<i>And a few years after that,
somebody shot his little brother, too,</i>

369
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,770
<i>only he was in a hotel kitchen.</i>

370
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,653
It must be hard being brothers.

371
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,867
I wouldn't know.

372
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:13,820
<i>Forrest Gump.</i>

373
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,196
<i>Now can you believe it?</i>

374
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:19,204
<i>After only five years of playing football,
I got a college degree.</i>

375
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,286
Congratulations, son.

376
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,126
<i>Mama was so proud.</i>

377
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:29,302
Forrest, I'm so proud of you.
Here, I'll hold this for you.

378
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,512
Congratulations, son.

379
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,633
Have you given any thought
to your future?

380
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:37,810
Thought?

381
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,104
Hello, I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

382
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:44,184
Nobody gives a hunk of shit
who you are, fuzzball!

383
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,936
You're not even a low-life,
scum-sucking maggot!

384
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,990
Get your faggotty ass on the bus.
You're in the Army now!

385
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,113
This seat's taken.

386
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,362
Taken.

387
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,080
<i>At first, it seemed like I made a mistake,</i>

388
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,207
<i>seeing how it was only
my induction day</i>

389
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,047
<i>and I was already getting yelled at.</i>

390
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:12,379
You can sit down if you want to.

391
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:16,349
<i>I didn't know who I might meet,
or what they might ask.</i>

392
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:19,059
You ever been on a real shrimp boat?

393
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:23,182
No, but I been on a real big boat.

394
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:26,772
I'm talking about
a shrimp-catching boat.

395
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:29,354
I've been working
on shrimp boats all my life.

396
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,232
I started out on my uncle's boat,
that's my mama's brother,

397
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,404
when I was about maybe nine.

398
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:38,655
I was just looking into buying a boat
of my own and got drafted.

399
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:44,369
My given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.
People call me Bubba.

400
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:48,665
Just like one of them old redneck boys.
Can you believe that?

401
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:52,422
My name's Forrest Gump.
People call me Forrest Gump.

402
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,801
<i>So, Bubba was from
Bayou La Batre, Alabama,</i>

403
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,803
<i>and his mama cooked shrimp,</i>

404
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,929
<i>and her mama before her
cooked shrimp,</i>

405
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:06,023
<i>and her mama before her mama
cooked shrimp, too.</i>

406
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,316
<i>Bubba's family knew everything</i>

407
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,019
<i>there was to know
about the shrimping business.</i>

408
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:13,151
I know everything there is to know
about the shrimping business.

409
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,234
Matter of fact, I'm going into
the shrimping business for myself

410
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,702
after I get out the Army.

411
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,410
Okay.

412
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:26,711
Gump! What's your sole purpose
in this Army?

413
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,334
To do whatever you tell me,
Drill Sergeant!

414
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,792
God damn it, Gump!
You're a goddamn genius!

415
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,261
That's the most outstanding answer
I've ever heard.

416
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,131
You must have a goddamn IQ of 160!

417
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,225
You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump!

418
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,095
Listen up, people!

419
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:48,396
<i>Now, for some reason, I fit in the Army
like one of them round pegs.</i>

420
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:49,726
<i>It's not really hard.</i>

421
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:53,438
<i>You just make your bed real neat
and remember to stand up straight,</i>

422
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:57,533
<i>and always answer every question
with, "Yes, Drill Sergeant!"</i>

423
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,076
Is that clear?

424
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,279
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!

425
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:05,079
What you do is, you just drag
your nets along the bottom.

426
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,912
On a good day, you can catch over
100 pounds of shrimp.

427
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:12,419
If everything goes all right,
two men shrimping 10 hours,

428
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:15,217
less what you spend on gas, you can...

429
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,091
- Done, Drill Sergeant!
- Gump!

430
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:23,218
Why did you put that weapon
together so quickly, Gump?

431
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,973
You told me to, Drill Sergeant.

432
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:28,519
Jesus H. Christ,
this is a new company record.

433
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,108
If it wouldn't be a waste
of such a damn fine enlisted man,

434
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,481
I'd recommend you for OCS,
Private Gump.

435
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,445
You are gonna be
a general some day, Gump.

436
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:38,616
Now, disassemble your weapon
and continue!

437
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:44,493
Anyway, like I was saying,
shrimp is the fruit of the sea.

438
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:49,328
You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it, bake it, sauté it.

439
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:52,414
There's shrimp kebabs, shrimp Creole...

440
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:57,552
...shrimp gumbo, pan fried,
deep fried, stir fried.

441
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:01,426
There's pineapple shrimp,
lemon shrimp,

442
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,849
coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp...

443
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:10,147
...shrimp soup, shrimp stew,
shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes,

444
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:13,271
shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich...

445
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,197
That's... That's about it.

446
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,870
<i>Night time in the Army is a lonely time.</i>

447
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:29,368
<i>We'd lay there in our bunks
and I'd miss my mama.</i>

448
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,453
<i>And I'd miss Jenny.</i>

449
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:40,253
Hey, Gump, get a load of the tits on her!

450
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:56,853
<i>Turns out, Jenny had gotten into
some trouble over</i>

451
00:35:56,946 --> 00:36:00,280
<i>some photos of her
in her college sweater,</i>

452
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,946
<i>and she was thrown out of school.</i>

453
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,706
<i>But that wasn't a bad thing,</i>

454
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:12,376
<i>because a man who owns
a theater in Memphis, Tennessee,</i>

455
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:17,503
<i>saw those photos and offered Jenny
a job singing in a show.</i>

456
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,133
<i>The first chance I got,</i>

457
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,925
<i>I took the bus up to Memphis
to see her perform in that show.</i>

458
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,506
<i>That was Amber, Amber Flame.</i>

459
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,058
<i>Give her a big hand, guys.
Good job, Amber.</i>

460
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,887
<i>And now, for your listening
and viewing pleasure,</i>

461
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,815
<i>direct from Hollywood, California,
our very own beatnik beauty,</i>

462
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:38,607
<i>let's give a big round of applause
to the luscious Bobbi Dylan.</i>

463
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:43,445
- All right!
- Bobbi!

464
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:08,057
<i>Her dream had come true.</i>

465
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,302
<i>She was a folk singer.</i>

466
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,814
Come on, baby. Shake it up.
Shake it up, now.

467
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,398
Hey, buddy, get her a harmonica.

468
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,200
Hey, honey, this ain't <i>Captain Kangaroo.</i>

469
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,869
Hey, honey,
I got something here for you.

470
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,662
- God damn it!
- Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk!

471
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,214
I'm singing a song here.

472
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,965
Polly, get out here!

473
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,761
- Shut up, there!
- Don't be so shy, honey.

474
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,384
Oh, shut up!

475
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,803
Forrest, what are you doing here?

476
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,604
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

477
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,056
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

478
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,184
Forrest, let me down!

479
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,945
You can't keep doing this, Forrest.

480
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:09,118
You can't keep trying
to rescue me all the time.

481
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:13,289
- They was trying to grab you.
- A lot of people try to grab me.

482
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:17,373
Just... You can't keep
doing this all the time.

483
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:20,792
I can't help it. I love you.

484
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:25,251
Forrest, you don't know what love is.

485
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,553
You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

486
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:40,934
We prayed for God to turn me
into a bird so I could fly far, far away?

487
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,270
Yes, I do.

488
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:51,077
You think I could fly off this bridge?

489
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,914
What do you mean, Jenny?

490
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,291
Nothing.

491
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,300
I gotta get out of here.

492
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,681
Wait, Jenny...

493
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:18,229
Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?
You just stay away from me, please.

494
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,600
Can I have a ride?

495
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,227
- Where you going?
- I don't care.

496
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,683
Get in the truck.

497
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,609
So, bye-bye, Jenny.

498
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,448
They sending me to Vietnam.

499
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,616
It's this whole other country.

500
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,117
Just hang on a minute.

501
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,583
Listen, you promise me
something, okay?

502
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:47,007
Just, if you're ever in trouble,
don't try to be brave. You just run, okay?

503
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,717
Just run away.

504
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,303
Okay.

505
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,517
Jenny.

506
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,684
I'll write you all the time.

507
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,818
<i>And just like that, she was gone.</i>

508
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:33,262
You come back safe to me,
do you hear?

509
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:20,517
<i>Now, they told us that Vietnam
was gonna be very different</i>

510
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:23,471
<i>from the United States of America.</i>

511
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:28,605
<i>And except for all the beer cans
and the barbecue, it was.</i>

512
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,830
Hey, I bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

513
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:45,080
They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimpers.

514
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,708
You know, after we win this war,
and we take over everything,

515
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,005
we can get American shrimpers

516
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,832
to come out here
and shrimp these waters.

517
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,462
We'll just shrimp all the time, man.

518
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,758
So much shrimp, why,
you wouldn't believe it.

519
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:59,344
You must be my FNGs.

520
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:00,675
- Morning, sir!
- Morning, sir!

521
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,385
Get your hands down! Do not salute me.

522
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,596
There's goddamn snipers
all around this area

523
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,524
who would love to grease an officer.

524
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:12,102
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fourth Platoon.

525
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:15,402
What's wrong with your lip?

526
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,858
I was born with big gums, sir.

527
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:22,663
Yeah, well, you better tuck that in.
Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.

528
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,199
Where you boys from in the world?

529
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:27,660
- Alabama, sir!
- Alabama, sir!

530
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,870
You twins?

531
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,379
No, we are not relations, sir.

532
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,550
Look, it's pretty basic here.

533
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,807
If you stick with me
and learn from the guys

534
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:45,557
who've been in country a while,
you'll be all right.

535
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,558
There is one item of GI gear

536
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:51,813
that can be the difference between
a live grunt and a dead grunt.

537
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:55,317
Socks. Cushion sole, OD green.

538
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,692
Try and keep your feet dry.

539
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,302
When we're out humping,
I want you boys to remember

540
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:00,784
to change your socks
whenever we stop.

541
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:03,829
The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet
right off his legs.

542
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,202
Sergeant Sims, God damn it,

543
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,811
where is that sling rope
I told you to order?

544
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,747
I put in the requisitions at Battalion.

545
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,899
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well,
you call those sons of bitches again...

546
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:16,839
<i>Lieutenant Dan sure knew his stuff.
I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant.</i>

547
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:21,054
<i>He was from a long,
great military tradition.</i>

548
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:24,349
<i>Somebody in his family
had fought and died</i>

549
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:29,597
<i>in every single American war.</i>

550
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,586
- God damn it, kick some ass!
- I'm on it, Lieutenant.

551
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,726
Get on it!

552
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:37,195
<i>I guess you could say he had
a lot to live up to.</i>

553
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:43,744
So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?
Well, I've been through there.

554
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:46,033
Little Rock's a fine town.

555
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:50,291
Now, go shake down your gear,
see the platoon sergeant,

556
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:52,836
draw what you need for the field.

557
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:56,882
If you boys are hungry,
we got steaks burning right over here.

558
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:59,836
Two standing orders in this platoon:

559
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:02,592
one, take good care of your feet,

560
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:07,764
two, try not to do anything stupid,
like getting yourself killed.

561
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:16,318
I sure hope I don't let him down.

562
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:32,831
<i>I got to see a lot of the countryside.
We would take these real long walks.</i>

563
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:45,423
<i>And we were always looking
for this guy named Charlie.</i>

564
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:55,516
- Hold it up!
- Hold up, boys!

565
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,695
<i>It wasn't always fun.</i>

566
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:05,071
<i>Lieutenant Dan was always getting
these funny feelings about a rock,</i>

567
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:10,247
<i>or a trail, or the road,
so he'd tell us to get down, shut up...</i>

568
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,325
Get down! Shut up!

569
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:14,751
<i>...so we did.</i>

570
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:34,475
<i>Now, I don't know much about anything,</i>

571
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:38,400
<i>but I think some of America's
best young men served in this war.</i>

572
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:41,194
<i>There was Dallas, from Phoenix,</i>

573
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:45,695
<i>Cleveland, he was from Detroit.</i>

574
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:48,193
Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex.

575
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:50,491
Man, what the hell's going on?

576
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:54,916
<i>And Tex was... Well, I don't remember
where Tex come from.</i>

577
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,538
Nothing.

578
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:03,167
Fourth Platoon, on your feet.

579
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:06,971
Still got 10 klicks to go to that river.
Move out.

580
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:08,843
Come on, move out.

581
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,306
Step it up. Look alive out there.

582
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:17,731
<i>The good thing about Vietnam
is there was always some place to go.</i>

583
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,224
Fire in the hole!

584
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:25,030
Gump, check out that hole.

585
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:28,109
<i>And there was always something to do.</i>

586
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:31,366
- Mount them up.
- Spread out! Cover his back.

587
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:42,040
<i>One day, it started raining,
and it didn't quit for four months.</i>

588
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,918
<i>We'd been through
every kind of rain there is:</i>

589
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,591
<i>little bitty stinging rain,</i>

590
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:51,970
<i>and big old fat rain,</i>

591
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:55,143
<i>rain that flew in sideways.</i>

592
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:59,269
<i>And sometimes, rain even seemed
to come straight up from underneath.</i>

593
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,435
<i>Shoot, it even rained at night.</i>

594
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,946
- Hey, Forrest.
- Hey, Bubba.

595
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:10,363
I'm gonna lean up against you.
You just lean right back against me.

596
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:14,288
This way, we don't have to sleep
with our heads in the mud.

597
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,708
You know why we a good partnership,
Forrest?

598
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:21,286
'Cause we be watching out
for one another,

599
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,288
like brothers and stuff.

600
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,923
Hey, Forrest, there's something
I've been thinking about.

601
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:32,006
I got a very important question
to ask you.

602
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:37,602
How would you like to go
into the shrimping business with me?

603
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:40,389
Okay.

604
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:43,942
Man, I tell you what,
I got it all figured out, too.

605
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,816
So many pounds of shrimp
to pay off the boat,

606
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:50,236
so many pounds for gas,
we can just live right on the boat.

607
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:52,613
We ain't got to pay no rent.

608
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,786
I'll be the captain,
we can just work it together,

609
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:59,116
split everything right down the middle.
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

610
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:02,794
And, hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat.

611
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,127
That's a fine idea.

612
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:09,335
<i>Bubba did have a fine idea.</i>

613
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,224
<i>I even wrote Jenny
and told her all about it.</i>

614
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:20,228
<i>I sent her letters,
not every day, but almost.</i>

615
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:25,309
<i>I told her what I was doing
and asked her what she was doing,</i>

616
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:28,146
<i>and told her
how I thought about her always,</i>

617
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:32,449
<i>and how I was looking forward
to getting a letter from her</i>

618
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:35,027
<i>just as soon as she had the time.</i>

619
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,406
<i>I'd always let her know that I was okay.</i>

620
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:45,875
<i>Then, I'd sign each letter,
"Love, Forrest Gump."</i>

621
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:04,473
<i>This one day, we was out walking,
like always,</i>

622
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:07,526
<i>and then, just like that,</i>

623
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:11,860
<i>somebody turned off the rain
and the sun come out.</i>

624
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:16,701
Ambush!

625
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,570
Take cover!

626
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,370
Get down!

627
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:24,918
Get the sixty!

628
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,173
Get that pig up here, God damn it!

629
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:32,376
Forrest, you okay?

630
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:38,215
Strongarm! Strongarm!
Be advised, Strongarm!

631
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,180
Medic, we got a man down!

632
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:44,229
Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over!

633
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,274
Roger, Strongarm, be advised
we have incoming from the tree line

634
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,895
at points blue plus two.
AKs and rockets...

635
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,360
Misfire! Misfire!

636
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:58,736
God damn it! Mac!

637
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:03,119
Get that thing...
Fuck it, get it in the tree line!

638
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,245
Jesus!

639
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,585
My unit is down hard and hurting!

640
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:11,252
Six are pulling back to Blue Line,
Leg Lima 6 out.

641
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:14,008
Pull back! Pull back!

642
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,211
Run! Run, Forrest!

643
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:18,638
- Pull back!
- Forrest, Forrest!

644
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:21,349
Run, man! Run!

645
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,222
Pull back! Run!

646
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:27,272
Run, God damn it, run!

647
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:53,082
Medic! Can I get a medic?

648
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:56,801
<i>I ran and ran, just like Jenny told me to.</i>

649
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:04,392
<i>I ran so far and so fast
that pretty soon I was all by myself,</i>

650
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,435
<i>which was a bad thing.</i>

651
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,517
Bubba!

652
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:14,440
<i>Bubba was my best good friend.
I had to make sure that he was okay.</i>

653
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,195
Any friendlies out there?

654
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,323
Yeah, I've got three over here.

655
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:25,948
Where the hell are you?

656
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:27,874
Bubba?

657
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:31,669
<i>And on my way back to find Bubba,</i>

658
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:34,585
<i>well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.</i>

659
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:35,882
Tex!

660
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:38,970
Okay.

661
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:43,014
<i>I couldn't just let him lay there
all alone, scared the way he was,</i>

662
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:47,011
<i>so I grabbed him up
and run him out of there.</i>

663
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:04,574
<i>And every time I went back
looking for Bubba,</i>

664
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:08,198
<i>somebody else was saying,
"Help me, Forrest. Help me."</i>

665
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:17,749
Can't hear... Can't hear...

666
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:21,340
No sweat, man. Just lay back.

667
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,922
You'll be okay. You'll be okay.

668
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:28,972
<i>I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.</i>

669
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:30,304
<i>...over.</i>

670
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:33,686
Roger, Strongarm,
I know my position is danger close.

671
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:35,608
We got Charlie all over this area.

672
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:38,023
I gotta have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

673
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:41,481
<i>- Six, Strongarm, we want...</i>
- Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!

674
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:42,782
I know he's dead!

675
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:45,744
My whole goddamn platoon
is wiped out!

676
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,265
<i>- Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6.</i>
- God damn it!

677
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,997
<i>- Copy this transmission. Over.</i>
- What are you doing?

678
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:53,418
Just leave me here! Get away.
Just leave me here! Get out!

679
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,832
<i>Leg Lima 6, Strongarm.
How copy this? Over.</i>

680
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:58,540
God, I said leave me here, God damn it!

681
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:01,798
<i>Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6,
this is Strongarm, be advised</i>

682
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,886
<i>your fast movers
are inbound at this time, over.</i>

683
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:07,386
<i>Then, it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.</i>

684
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,930
Something bit me!

685
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,936
You chink son of a bitch!

686
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,440
I can't leave the platoon.

687
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:28,491
I told you to leave me there, Gump.
Forget about me. Get yourself out!

688
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,739
Did you hear what I said?

689
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,415
God damn it, put me down!

690
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:36,165
Get your ass out of here!

691
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:42,049
I didn't ask you to pull me out of there,
God damn you!

692
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:43,571
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

693
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:44,676
To get Bubba.

694
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:48,640
I got an air strike inbound right now.
They're gonna nape the whole area.

695
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:51,134
Gump, you stay here, God damn it!
That's an order!

696
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,683
I gotta find Bubba!

697
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,120
Forrest.

698
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:21,544
- Bubba.
- I'm okay, Forrest.

699
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,004
I'm okay.

700
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:33,684
Oh, Bubba, no...

701
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:36,020
Nah, I'm gonna be all right.

702
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:46,861
Come on. Come on. Come on.

703
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:53,363
I'm okay, Forrest.

704
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,542
I'm okay, man. I'm fine.

705
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:37,699
Helo's inbound.
Top smoke, get it out there!

706
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:43,247
<i>If I'd a known this was gonna be the
last time me and Bubba was gonna talk,</i>

707
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:45,669
<i>I'd of thought of something better to say.</i>

708
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,250
Hey, Bubba.

709
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:49,753
Hey, Forrest.

710
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:55,308
Forrest, why'd this happen?

711
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:58,432
You got shot.

712
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:04,313
<i>Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.</i>

713
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:06,774
I wanna go home.

714
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,819
<i>Bubba was my best good friend.</i>

715
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:16,325
<i>And even I know that ain't something
you can find just around the corner.</i>

716
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:19,540
<i>Bubba was gonna be
a shrimping boat captain,</i>

717
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:23,586
<i>but instead he died right there
by that river in Vietnam.</i>

718
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:31,590
That's all I have to say about that.

719
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:36,136
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

720
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:41,141
- A bullet?
- That jumped up and bit you.

721
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,608
Oh, yes, sir.

722
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:48,812
Bit me directly in the buttocks.

723
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:54,193
They said it was a million-dollar wound,
but the Army must keep that money,

724
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:58,163
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

725
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:02,492
The only good thing
about being wounded in the buttocks

726
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,335
<i>is the ice cream.</i>

727
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:07,046
<i>They gave me all the ice cream
I could eat.</i>

728
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:08,460
<i>And guess what?</i>

729
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,668
<i>A good friend of mine
was in the bed right next door.</i>

730
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:16,973
Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream.

731
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:21,515
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.

732
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,528
It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.

733
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:45,376
Harper!

734
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:51,048
Cooper, Larson,

735
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:54,593
Webster,

736
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:59,507
- Gump. Gump.
- I'm Forrest Gump.

737
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:06,352
Kyle, Nichols,

738
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:14,530
McMill, Johnson, Tyler,

739
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,233
Holiday...

740
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:26,243
<i>Surprise, surprise, surprise!</i>

741
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:32,081
Gump, how can you watch
that stupid shit?

742
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,820
<i>- From the DMZ to the Delta...</i>
- Turn it off!

743
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:37,087
<i>...you are tuned to the
American Forces Vietnam Network.</i>

744
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,555
<i>This is Channel 6, Saigon.</i>

745
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:43,931
Good catch, Gump.

746
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,059
You know how to play this?

747
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,442
Come on, let me show you. Here.

748
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,863
Now, the secret to this game is,

749
00:58:55,949 --> 00:59:01,786
no matter what happens,
never ever take your eye off the ball.

750
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,707
All right.

751
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:13,711
<i>For some reason,
Ping-Pong came very natural to me.</i>

752
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:16,964
See? Any idiot can play.

753
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:20,214
<i>So, I started playing it all the time.</i>

754
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,723
<i>I played Ping-Pong</i>

755
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:26,098
<i>even when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.</i>

756
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:38,819
<i>The hospital's people said
it made me look like a duck in water,</i>

757
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,782
<i>whatever that means.</i>

758
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:44,487
<i>Even Lieutenant Dan would come
and watch me play.</i>

759
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:53,872
<i>I played Ping-Pong so much,
I even played it in my sleep.</i>

760
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:06,767
Now, you listen to me.
We all have a destiny.

761
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,891
Nothing just happens,
it's all part of a plan.

762
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,686
I should have died out there
with my men,

763
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:16,778
but now I'm nothing
but a goddamn cripple,

764
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:20,482
a legless freak! Look! Look! Look at me!

765
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:22,324
Do you see that?

766
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:26,199
Do you know what it's like
not to be able to use your legs?

767
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:31,159
Yes, sir, I do.

768
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,877
Did you hear what I said?

769
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,500
You cheated me.

770
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:40,755
I had a destiny.

771
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:44,385
I was supposed to die in the field,
with honor!

772
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:49,098
That was my destiny,
and you cheated me out of it!

773
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:01,446
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Gump?

774
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:06,945
This wasn't supposed to happen,
not to me.

775
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,245
I had a destiny.

776
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:17,581
I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor.

777
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:26,096
You're still Lieutenant Dan.

778
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:50,822
Look at me.

779
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:54,124
What am I gonna do now?

780
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,834
What am I gonna do now?

781
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:11,684
PFC Gump?

782
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,641
Yes, sir!

783
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:16,806
As you were.

784
01:02:17,317 --> 01:02:21,152
Son, you've been awarded
the Medal of Honor.

785
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:25,816
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan,
they want to give me a...

786
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:36,326
Ma'am, what'd they do
with Lieutenant Dan?

787
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:39,041
They sent him home.

788
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:47,796
<i>Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.</i>

789
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:52,387
<i>The ceremony was kicked off
with a candid speech by the President</i>

790
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:55,845
<i>regarding the need for further escalation
of the war in Vietnam.</i>

791
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:58,056
<i>President Johnson awarded
four Medals of Honor</i>

792
01:02:58,149 --> 01:02:59,811
<i>to men
from each of the Armed Services.</i>

793
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:02,814
<i>America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.</i>

794
01:03:04,823 --> 01:03:08,612
<i>I understand you were wounded.
Where were you hit?</i>

795
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:11,866
<i>- In the buttocks, sir.
- That must be a sight.</i>

796
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,909
<i>I'd kind of like to see that.</i>

797
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,512
<i>God damn, son.</i>

798
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:36,477
<i>After that,
Mama went to the hotel to lay down,</i>

799
01:03:36,563 --> 01:03:40,056
<i>so I went out for a walk
to see our nation's capital.</i>

800
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:43,268
Hilary, all right, I've got the vets,
what do you want me to do with them?

801
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,102
What are you doing here so late?

802
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:49,236
<i>It's a good thing Mama was resting,
'cause the streets was awful crowded</i>

803
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:52,490
<i>with people looking
at all the statues and monuments,</i>

804
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:55,196
<i>and some of them people were loud
and pushy.</i>

805
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:58,249
Okay, follow me! Come on.
Let's move it out.

806
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:02,044
<i>Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.</i>

807
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,836
Follow me, let's go!

808
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:10,252
Come on. Let's go.

809
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:17,893
Stand here.

810
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:23,521
Hey, you're a good man
for doing this. Good!

811
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:25,935
Okay.

812
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:30,106
<i>There was this man giving a little talk.</i>

813
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,693
<i>And for some reason, he was
wearing an American flag for a shirt.</i>

814
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:35,306
<i>Now, I'm gonna
bring up some soldiers...</i>

815
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:38,118
<i>And he liked to say the "F" word.</i>

816
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:41,576
<i>A lot."F" this and "F" that.</i>

817
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:44,002
<i>And every time he said the "F" word,</i>

818
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:46,832
<i>people, for some reason,
well, they'd cheer.</i>

819
01:04:46,925 --> 01:04:50,009
<i>...where to stick this fucking war! Yeah!</i>

820
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:53,387
<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>

821
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:56,465
Come on, man, come up here, man.

822
01:04:56,893 --> 01:05:00,227
Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!
Come on. Move, move, move.

823
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:04,645
You can do it. Just get up there.
Go on. That's it.

824
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,993
<i>Tell us a little bit about the war, man.</i>

825
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:21,824
<i>The war in Vietnam?</i>

826
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,831
<i>- The war in Viet-fucking-nam!</i>
- Yeah!

827
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:46,272
Peace!

828
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:48,017
Come on, man, go!

829
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,276
- Come on!
- Peace!

830
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:51,399
<i>Well...</i>

831
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:54,948
<i>There was only one thing
I could say about the war in Vietnam.</i>

832
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:59,870
<i>...there's only one thing
I can say about the war in Vietnam.</i>

833
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:07,457
<i>In Vietnam, your...</i>

834
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:18,367
Hey, what the hell are you...

835
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:21,134
I'll beat your head in,
you goddamn oinker!

836
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,719
Jesus Christ, what'd they do with this?

837
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,810
We can't hear you!

838
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:30,518
We can't hear anything!

839
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:33,729
- This one! This one! Give me that!
- Turn it up!

840
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,234
Speak up!

841
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:37,491
That's it!

842
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:41,412
<i>...and that's all I have to say about that.</i>

843
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:51,672
That's so right on, man. You said it all.

844
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:55,668
What's your name, man?

845
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:58,379
<i>My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.</i>

846
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:00,760
<i>Forrest Gump!</i>

847
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:02,258
- Gump!
- Gump!

848
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:07,514
Forrest! Forrest!

849
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:13,936
<i>- Jenny!</i>
- Forrest!

850
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:33,376
Hey! Hey!

851
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:44,592
<i>It was the happiest moment of my life.</i>

852
01:07:46,938 --> 01:07:50,306
<i>Jenny and me were just like
peas and carrots again.</i>

853
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:53,233
<i>She showed me around,</i>

854
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,902
<i>and even introduced me
to some of her new friends.</i>

855
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:57,321
Shut that blind, man.

856
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:59,656
And get your white ass
away from that window.

857
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,825
Don't you know we in a war here?

858
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:04,139
Hey, man, he's cool. He's cool.
He's one of us.

859
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:06,141
- Let me tell you about us.
- Where the hell have you been?

860
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:08,248
Our purpose here
is to protect our black leaders

861
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,075
from the racial onslaught of the pig

862
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:12,252
who wishes to brutalize
our black leaders,

863
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:15,672
rape our women,
and destroy our black communities.

864
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:20,507
Who's the baby killer?

865
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:23,346
This is my good friend I told you about.
This is Forrest Gump.

866
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:25,174
Forrest, this is Wesley.

867
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:26,620
Wesley and I lived together in Berkeley,

868
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:29,261
and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.

869
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:30,766
Let me tell you something else.

870
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:35,101
We are here to offer protection and help
for all of those who need our help,

871
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:38,778
because we, the Black Panthers,
are against the war in Vietnam.

872
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:42,529
Yes, we are against any war where
black soldiers are sent to the frontline

873
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,531
to die for a country that hates them.

874
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:47,785
Yes, we are against any war
where black soldiers go to fight

875
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:50,958
and come to be brutalized and killed
in their own communities

876
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:52,626
as they sleep in their beds at night.

877
01:08:52,712 --> 01:08:53,873
You are a fucking asshole!

878
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:57,331
Yes, we are against all these racist
and imperial dog acts.

879
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:09,852
Forrest! Quit it! Quit it!

880
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:13,055
Forrest!

881
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,391
Stop it! Stop it!

882
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:23,399
Oh, God...

883
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:26,656
I shouldn't have brought you here.

884
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:30,365
I should have known it was just
gonna be some bullshit hassle.

885
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:34,159
He should not be hitting you, Jenny.

886
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:40,833
Come on, Forrest.

887
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:50,551
Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party.

888
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,834
He doesn't mean it when
he does things like this. He doesn't.

889
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:58,191
I would never hurt you, Jenny.

890
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,271
I know you wouldn't, Forrest.

891
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,783
I wanted to be your boyfriend.

892
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:19,709
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.

893
01:10:21,092 --> 01:10:24,301
You look handsome in it. You do.

894
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:30,303
- You know what?
- What?

895
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:37,557
I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital.

896
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:40,893
Me, too, Forrest.

897
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:45,652
<i>We walked around all night,
Jenny and me, just talking.</i>

898
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:50,908
<i>She told me about
all the traveling she'd done.</i>

899
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:55,583
<i>And how she'd discovered ways
to expand her mind</i>

900
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,752
<i>and learn how to live in harmony,</i>

901
01:10:58,838 --> 01:11:01,171
<i>which must be out west somewhere,</i>

902
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:03,590
<i>'cause she made it
all the way to California.</i>

903
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:05,918
<i>Try to love one another right now</i>

904
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:07,173
Hey!

905
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:10,677
Anybody want to go to San Francisco?

906
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,633
- I'll go.
- Far out.

907
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:17,267
<i>It was a very special night
for the two of us.</i>

908
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:20,941
<i>I didn't want it to end.</i>

909
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:24,144
I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

910
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:26,943
I have to, Forrest.

911
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,191
Jenny?

912
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:33,953
Things got a little out of hand.

913
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:37,875
It's just this war
and that lying son of a bitch, Johnson!

914
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:42,333
I would never hurt you, you know that.

915
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:47,460
You know what I think?

916
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:54,217
I think you should go home
to Greenbow, Alabama!

917
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:09,823
Forrest, we have very different lives,
you know.

918
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:22,416
I want you to have this.

919
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:29,255
Forrest, I can't keep this.

920
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:35,174
I got it just by doing
what you told me to do.

921
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:39,390
Why are you so good to me?

922
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:42,434
You're my girl.

923
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:46,560
I'll always be your girl.

924
01:13:26,986 --> 01:13:31,822
<i>And just like that, she was gone,
out of my life again.</i>

925
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:35,659
<i>That's one small step for man,</i>

926
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:40,497
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

927
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:48,664
<i>I thought I was going back to Vietnam,</i>

928
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:52,008
<i>but instead, they decided the best way
for me to fight the Communists</i>

929
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:53,710
<i>was to play Ping-Pong.</i>

930
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:56,091
<i>So, I was in the Special Services,</i>

931
01:13:56,182 --> 01:13:59,425
<i>traveling around the country
cheering up all them wounded veterans</i>

932
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:01,931
and showing them
how to play Ping-Pong.

933
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:03,933
I was so good that some years later

934
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:07,642
<i>the Army decided that I should be
on the All-American Ping-Pong team.</i>

935
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,690
<i>We were the first Americans
to visit the land of China</i>

936
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:13,193
<i>in like a million years,
or something like that.</i>

937
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:16,738
<i>Somebody said world peace
was in our hands,</i>

938
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:19,615
<i>but all I did was play Ping-Pong.</i>

939
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,789
When I got home,
I was a national celebrity.

940
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:25,788
Famouser even than Captain Kangaroo.

941
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:28,541
<i>Here he is, Forrest Gump, right here.</i>

942
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,045
<i>Mr. Gump, have a seat.</i>

943
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,720
<i>Forrest Gump, John Lennon.</i>

944
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:43,705
<i>- Welcome home.
- You had quite a trip.</i>

945
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:47,063
<i>Can you tell us, what was China like?</i>

946
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:55,565
<i>In the land of China,
people hardly got nothing at all.</i>

947
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:57,240
<i>No possessions?</i>

948
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:03,079
<i>And in China, they never go to church.</i>

949
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:06,082
<i>No religion, too?</i>

950
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:11,293
<i>- Hard to imagine.
- Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.</i>

951
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:15,459
<i>Some years later,
that nice young man from England</i>

952
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:18,170
<i>was on his way home
to see his little boy</i>

953
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:21,257
<i>and was signing some autographs,</i>

954
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:25,352
<i>and for no particular reason at all,
somebody shot him.</i>

955
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:32,234
They gave you
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

956
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,612
Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.

957
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:40,025
Lieutenant Dan!

958
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:44,580
They gave you
the Congressional Medal of Honor!

959
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:47,950
Yes, sir, they surely did.

960
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:50,036
They gave you,

961
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:54,294
an imbecile,
a moron who goes on television

962
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:58,627
and makes a fool out of himself
in front of the whole damn country,

963
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:01,797
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

964
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:04,136
Yes, sir.

965
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:09,146
Well, then, that's just perfect!

966
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:13,400
Yeah, well,
I just got one thing to say to that.

967
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:15,728
God damn bless America.

968
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:17,941
Hey!

969
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:21,074
Oh, God!

970
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,992
- Oh, God!
- Lieutenant Dan!

971
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:29,867
<i>Lieutenant Dan said
he was living in a hotel.</i>

972
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,917
<i>And because he didn't have no legs,</i>

973
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:35,168
<i>he spent most of his time
exercising his arms.</i>

974
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:40,510
Take a right. Take a right.

975
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,678
Hey! Come on, already!

976
01:16:45,768 --> 01:16:48,556
What do you do here in New York,
Lieutenant Dan?

977
01:16:48,646 --> 01:16:51,184
I'm living off the government tit.

978
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:54,183
Sucking it dry!

979
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:56,313
Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you blind?

980
01:16:56,403 --> 01:16:58,110
- I'm walking here!
- Get out of the way!

981
01:16:58,197 --> 01:17:00,780
Get out! Come on, go! Go! Go!

982
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:11,576
<i>I stayed with Lieutenant Dan
and celebrated the holidays.</i>

983
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:19,420
<i>You have a great year.
Hurry home and God bless you.</i>

984
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:25,217
Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?

985
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:30,473
I didn't know I was supposed to be
looking for him, sir.

986
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:40,437
That's all these cripples,
down at the VA,

987
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:42,944
that's all they ever talk about.

988
01:17:44,118 --> 01:17:47,077
Jesus this and Jesus that.

989
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:50,826
Have I found Jesus?

990
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:54,451
They even had a priest come
and talk to me.

991
01:17:55,337 --> 01:18:00,002
He said God is listening,
but I have to help myself.

992
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:03,672
How if I accept Jesus into my heart,

993
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:08,469
I'll get to walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

994
01:18:08,559 --> 01:18:10,721
Did you hear what I said?

995
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:15,764
Walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

996
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:18,817
Well, kiss my crippled ass.

997
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:22,271
God is listening? What a crock of shit.

998
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:28,568
I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.

999
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:31,533
Oh?

1000
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:37,744
Well,

1001
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:44,084
before you go, why don't you get
your ass down to the corner

1002
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:46,670
- and get us another bottle of Ripple.
- Yes, sir.

1003
01:18:46,764 --> 01:18:51,884
<i>We are at approximately 45th Street
in New York City at One Astor Plaza.</i>

1004
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:53,809
<i>This is the site of the old Astor Hotel.</i>

1005
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:56,104
What the hell is in Bayou La Batre?

1006
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:58,523
- Shrimping boats.
- Shrimping boats?

1007
01:18:58,609 --> 01:19:01,022
Who gives a shit
about shrimping boats?

1008
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:02,631
I gotta buy me
one of them shrimping boats,

1009
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,191
soon as I have some money.

1010
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:07,115
I made me a promise to Bubba
in Vietnam

1011
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:09,909
that as soon as the war was over,
we'd go in partners.

1012
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:13,409
He'd be the captain of the
shrimping boat and I'd be his first mate.

1013
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:16,958
But now that he's dead,
that means I gotta be the captain.

1014
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:19,752
- A shrimp boat captain.
- Yes, sir.

1015
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:22,581
A promise is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.

1016
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:26,551
Now hear this!

1017
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:31,139
Private Gump here
is gonna be a shrimp boat captain.

1018
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:33,303
Well, I tell you what, Gilligan,

1019
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:35,852
the day that you are
a shrimp boat captain,

1020
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:39,477
- I will come and be your first mate.
- Okay.

1021
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:43,901
If you're ever a shrimp boat captain,
that's the day I'm an astronaut.

1022
01:19:43,988 --> 01:19:46,981
Danny, what are
you complaining about?

1023
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:49,657
- What are you doing, hon?
- Mr. Hot Wheels.

1024
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:53,362
- Who's your friend?
- My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump.

1025
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:58,416
This is Cunning Carla
and Long-Limbs Lenore.

1026
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:02,712
So, where you been, baby cakes, huh?
Haven't seen you around lately.

1027
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:04,317
You know, you should have
been here for Christmas,

1028
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:05,735
'cause Tommy bought a round
on the house

1029
01:20:05,759 --> 01:20:07,250
and gave everybody a turkey sandwich.

1030
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:10,382
Well, well, I had company.

1031
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:14,929
Hey, hey! We was just there.
That's at Times Square.

1032
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:19,680
Don't you just love New Year's?
You get to start all over.

1033
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:23,062
- Hey, Lenore...
- Everybody gets a second chance.

1034
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:25,690
<i>It's funny,
but in the middle of all that fun,</i>

1035
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:28,066
<i>I began to think about Jenny,</i>

1036
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:33,452
<i>wondering how she was spending
her New Year's night out in California.</i>

1037
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:59,553
<i>...eight, seven, six, five,</i>

1038
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:03,147
four, three, two, one!

1039
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:05,938
Happy New Year!

1040
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:25,127
Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan!

1041
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:04,080
What are you, stupid or something?
What's your problem?

1042
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:06,164
What's his problem?

1043
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:08,497
Did you lose your pecker in the war
or something?

1044
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:10,627
What, is your friend stupid
or something?

1045
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:11,798
What did you say?

1046
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:13,363
I said, is your friend stupid
or something?

1047
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:15,549
Hey! Don't call him stupid!

1048
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:17,596
- Hey, don't you push her!
- You shut up!

1049
01:22:17,683 --> 01:22:19,786
- Don't you ever call him stupid!
- What's the matter, baby?

1050
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:21,579
- Why are you so upset?
- Just get the hell out of here.

1051
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:22,747
- Stupid damn...
- Get your goddamn clothes...

1052
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:24,332
You belong in <i>Ripley's Believe It Or Not!</i>

1053
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,292
- Get the hell out of here!
- You should be in a sideshow!

1054
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:27,352
Go on! Get out of here!

1055
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:28,795
Come on, Lenore.
We don't need this shit!

1056
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:30,185
Get out of here!

1057
01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:34,360
- You retard.
- Loser. You freak.

1058
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:40,953
No, no.

1059
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:10,066
I'm sorry I ruined your
New Year's Eve party, Lieutenant Dan.

1060
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,939
She tasted like cigarettes.

1061
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:33,624
<i>I guess Lieutenant Dan figured there's
some things you just can't change.</i>

1062
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:38,837
<i>He didn't want to be called crippled,
just like I didn't want to be called stupid.</i>

1063
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:46,219
Happy New Year, Gump.

1064
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:52,392
<i>The US Ping-Pong team</i>

1065
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:54,839
<i>met with President Nixon today
at an Oval Office ceremony...</i>

1066
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:57,606
And wouldn't you know it?
A few months later,

1067
01:23:57,699 --> 01:24:01,659
they invited me and the Ping-Pong team
to visit the White House.

1068
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:03,987
So, I went, again.

1069
01:24:04,831 --> 01:24:08,290
And I met the President
of the United States, again.

1070
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:12,003
<i>Only, this time, they didn't get us rooms
in a real fancy hotel.</i>

1071
01:24:12,089 --> 01:24:15,457
<i>So, are you enjoying yourself
in our nation's capital, young man?</i>

1072
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:18,544
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Well, where are you staying?</i>

1073
01:24:18,637 --> 01:24:21,254
<i>- It's called the Hotel Ebbott.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.</i>

1074
01:24:21,348 --> 01:24:24,466
<i>I know of a much nicer hotel.
It's brand-new, very modern.</i>

1075
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,552
<i>I'll have my people
take care of it for you.</i>

1076
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:28,303
<i>Security, Frank Wills.</i>

1077
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:31,981
Yeah, sir, you might want
to send a maintenance man

1078
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:34,730
over to that office across the way.

1079
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:37,700
The lights are off, and they must be
looking for a fuse box or something,

1080
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:40,489
'cause them flashlights,
they're keeping me awake.

1081
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:42,192
<i>Okay, sir. I'll check it out.</i>

1082
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:43,993
- Thank you.
<i>- No problem.</i>

1083
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:45,991
- Good night.
<i>- Good night.</i>

1084
01:24:49,626 --> 01:24:54,997
<i>Therefore, I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.</i>

1085
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:57,127
<i>Vice President Ford</i>

1086
01:24:57,217 --> 01:25:01,712
<i>will be sworn in as president
at that hour in this office.</i>

1087
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:07,889
<i>As I recall the high hopes for America
with which we began this second term...</i>

1088
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:14,686
Sergeant Gump.

1089
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:17,401
- Yes, sir!
- As you were.

1090
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:20,605
I have your discharge papers.
Your service is up, son.

1091
01:25:24,036 --> 01:25:26,779
Does this mean
I can't play Ping-Pong no more?

1092
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:28,829
For the Army it does.

1093
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:36,330
<i>And just like that, my service
in the United States Army was over.</i>

1094
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:43,424
<i>So, I went home.</i>

1095
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:08,324
- I'm home, Mama.
- I know, I know.

1096
01:26:09,956 --> 01:26:11,559
- Louise, he's here.
<i>- Now, when I got home,</i>

1097
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:15,623
<i>I had no idea,
but Mama had had all sorts of visitors.</i>

1098
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:18,041
We've had all sorts of visitors, Forrest.

1099
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:21,215
Everybody wants you
to use their Ping-Pong stuff.

1100
01:26:21,301 --> 01:26:25,090
One man even left a check for $25,000

1101
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:28,639
if you'd be agreeable to saying
you liked using their paddle.

1102
01:26:28,767 --> 01:26:31,430
Oh, but, Mama,
I only like using my own paddle.

1103
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,512
- Hi, Miss Louise.
- Hey, Forrest.

1104
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:36,518
I know that. I know that.

1105
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:39,271
But it's $25,000, Forrest.

1106
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:44,026
I thought maybe you could hold it
for a while, see if it grows on you.

1107
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:46,302
- Oh, you look good, Forrest.
<i>- That Mama, she sure was right.</i>

1108
01:26:46,326 --> 01:26:48,818
- You look real good.
<i>- It's funny how things work out.</i>

1109
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:52,072
<i>I didn't stay home for long,
because I'd made a promise to Bubba,</i>

1110
01:26:52,165 --> 01:26:54,407
<i>and I always try to keep my promise.</i>

1111
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:56,037
<i>So, I went on down to Bayou La Batre</i>

1112
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:59,872
<i>to meet Bubba's family
and make their introduction.</i>

1113
01:26:59,965 --> 01:27:03,629
Are you crazy, or just plain stupid?

1114
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:06,586
Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.

1115
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,046
I guess.

1116
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:12,641
<i>And, of course,
I paid my respect to Bubba himself.</i>

1117
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:17,184
Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump.

1118
01:27:20,318 --> 01:27:24,358
I remember everything you said,
and I got it all figured out.

1119
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:33,952
I'm taking the $24,562
and 47 cents that I got...

1120
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:38,625
<i>Or, that's left after a new hair cut
and a new suit,</i>

1121
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:40,669
<i>and I took Mama out
to a real fancy dinner,</i>

1122
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:43,999
<i>and I bought a bus ticket
and three Dr. Peppers.</i>

1123
01:27:44,551 --> 01:27:46,338
Tell me something.

1124
01:27:47,387 --> 01:27:49,504
Are you stupid or something?

1125
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:51,635
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

1126
01:27:51,725 --> 01:27:54,684
Well, that's what's left after me saying,

1127
01:27:55,604 --> 01:27:57,764
"When I was in China
on the All-America Ping-Pong team,

1128
01:27:57,856 --> 01:28:01,645
"I just loved playing Ping-Pong with
my Flex-O-Light Ping-Pong paddle,"

1129
01:28:01,735 --> 01:28:03,045
which everybody knows isn't true,

1130
01:28:03,069 --> 01:28:04,505
but Mama says it's just a little white lie

1131
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:06,691
so it wouldn't hurt nobody.

1132
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:14,033
So, anyway, I'm putting all that on gas,
ropes and new nets

1133
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:16,531
and a brand-new shrimping boat.

1134
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:41,473
<i>Now, Bubba had told me everything
he knew about shrimping,</i>

1135
01:28:41,566 --> 01:28:43,899
<i>but you know what I found out?</i>

1136
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:47,903
<i>Shrimping is tough.</i>

1137
01:28:50,116 --> 01:28:51,948
I only caught five.

1138
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:55,411
A couple more,
you could have yourself a cocktail.

1139
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,561
Hey, you ever think
about naming this old boat?

1140
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:03,248
It's bad luck
to have a boat without a name.

1141
01:29:05,632 --> 01:29:10,468
<i>I'd never named a boat before,
but there was only one I could think of,</i>

1142
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:14,847
<i>the most beautiful name
in the wide world.</i>

1143
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:38,705
<i>Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny
in a long while,</i>

1144
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:41,328
<i>but I thought about her a lot,</i>

1145
01:29:41,459 --> 01:29:44,918
<i>and I hoped that whatever
she was doing made her happy.</i>

1146
01:31:31,194 --> 01:31:33,732
<i>I thought about Jenny all the time.</i>

1147
01:31:58,388 --> 01:31:59,549
Hey!

1148
01:32:23,413 --> 01:32:28,078
Lieutenant Dan,
what are you doing here?

1149
01:32:28,168 --> 01:32:32,082
Well, thought I'd try out my sea legs.

1150
01:32:32,172 --> 01:32:35,916
But you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.

1151
01:32:36,009 --> 01:32:38,296
Yes, I know that.

1152
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:40,673
You wrote me a letter, you idiot.

1153
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:45,345
Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump.
I had to see this for myself.

1154
01:32:46,978 --> 01:32:53,851
And I told you if you were ever
a shrimp boat captain

1155
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:56,568
that I'd be your first mate.
Well, here I am.

1156
01:32:56,654 --> 01:32:59,772
- I am a man of my word.
- Okay.

1157
01:32:59,866 --> 01:33:03,860
Yeah, but don't you be thinking that
I'm going to be calling you "sir."

1158
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:05,327
No, sir.

1159
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:16,501
That's my boat.

1160
01:33:19,094 --> 01:33:24,556
I have a feeling if we head due east,
we'll find some shrimp,

1161
01:33:24,682 --> 01:33:26,264
so take a left.

1162
01:33:27,685 --> 01:33:30,598
- Take a left!
- Which way?

1163
01:33:30,688 --> 01:33:33,351
Over there! They're over there!

1164
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:37,860
- Get on the wheel and take a left!
- Okay.

1165
01:33:39,072 --> 01:33:43,191
Gump, what are you doing?
Take a left! Left!

1166
01:33:45,578 --> 01:33:49,197
That's where we're going
to find those shrimp, my boy!

1167
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:52,374
That's where we'll find them.

1168
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:09,175
- Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.
- Okay, so I was wrong.

1169
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:13,103
How are we going to find them?

1170
01:34:13,231 --> 01:34:15,723
Well, maybe you should
just pray for shrimp.

1171
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:25,028
<i>So, I went to church every Sunday.</i>

1172
01:34:26,286 --> 01:34:28,278
<i>Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,</i>

1173
01:34:28,413 --> 01:34:31,406
<i>though I think
he left the praying up to me.</i>

1174
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:51,260
- No shrimp.
- Where the hell's this God of yours?

1175
01:34:52,103 --> 01:34:57,815
<i>It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that,
'cause right then, God showed up.</i>

1176
01:35:14,667 --> 01:35:19,503
- You'll never sink this boat!
<i>- Now, me, I was scared,</i>

1177
01:35:19,631 --> 01:35:22,669
<i>but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.</i>

1178
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,132
Come on!

1179
01:35:27,263 --> 01:35:32,475
You call this a storm?
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1180
01:35:34,604 --> 01:35:38,974
It's time for a showdown! You and me!

1181
01:35:39,108 --> 01:35:42,977
I'm right here! Come and get me!

1182
01:35:44,781 --> 01:35:48,650
You'll never sink this boat!

1183
01:35:50,703 --> 01:35:52,865
<i>Hurricane Carmen
came through here yesterday,</i>

1184
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:55,535
<i>destroying nearly everything in its path.</i>

1185
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:58,159
<i>And as in other towns
up and down the coast,</i>

1186
01:35:58,336 --> 01:36:00,703
<i>Bayou La Batre's
entire shrimping industry</i>

1187
01:36:00,797 --> 01:36:04,666
<i>has fallen victim to Carmen
and has been left in utter ruin.</i>

1188
01:36:04,801 --> 01:36:07,919
<i>Speaking with local officials,
this reporter has learned,</i>

1189
01:36:08,012 --> 01:36:11,471
<i>in fact, only one shrimping boat
actually survived the storm.</i>

1190
01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:14,466
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.

1191
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:17,178
<i>After that, shrimping was easy.</i>

1192
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:25,978
<i>Since people still needed
them shrimps for shrimp cocktails</i>

1193
01:36:26,072 --> 01:36:30,191
and barbecues and all,
and we were the only boat left standing,

1194
01:36:30,368 --> 01:36:33,611
Bubba-Gump Shrimp's what they got.

1195
01:36:33,705 --> 01:36:38,291
We got a whole bunch of boats,
12 <i>Jennys,</i>

1196
01:36:38,376 --> 01:36:41,869
a big old warehouse. We even have
hats that say "Bubba-Gump" on them.

1197
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:45,502
Bubba-Gump Shrimp.
It's a household name.

1198
01:36:45,717 --> 01:36:47,424
Hold on there, boy.

1199
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:52,092
Are you telling me you're the owner of
the Bubba-Gump Shrimp Corporation?

1200
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:55,216
Yes, sir. We got more money
than Davy Crockett.

1201
01:36:56,853 --> 01:37:00,893
Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time,
but that tops them all.

1202
01:37:03,609 --> 01:37:06,397
We was sitting next to a millionaire.

1203
01:37:09,907 --> 01:37:14,527
Well, I thought it was a very lovely story,

1204
01:37:14,954 --> 01:37:19,574
and you tell it so well,
with such enthusiasm.

1205
01:37:21,294 --> 01:37:23,957
Would you like to see
what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

1206
01:37:24,088 --> 01:37:25,579
Well, yes, I would.

1207
01:37:30,803 --> 01:37:32,840
That's him right there.

1208
01:37:34,974 --> 01:37:37,216
And let me tell you something
about Lieutenant Dan...

1209
01:37:38,394 --> 01:37:39,430
Forrest,

1210
01:37:44,984 --> 01:37:47,772
I never thanked you for saving my life.

1211
01:38:13,805 --> 01:38:20,097
<i>He never actually said so,
but I think he made his peace with God.</i>

1212
01:38:27,777 --> 01:38:29,985
<i>For the second time in 17 days,</i>

1213
01:38:30,113 --> 01:38:33,572
<i>President Ford escaped
possible assassination today.</i>

1214
01:38:33,658 --> 01:38:34,944
<i>Base to</i> Jenny 1.

1215
01:38:35,034 --> 01:38:38,527
<i>- Base to</i> Jenny 1.
<i>- Jenny 1</i>. Go, Margo.

1216
01:38:38,621 --> 01:38:40,112
<i>Forrest has a phone call.</i>

1217
01:38:40,206 --> 01:38:42,698
Yeah, well, you'll have to tell them
to call him back.

1218
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:46,160
- He is indisposed at the moment.
<i>- His mama's sick.</i>

1219
01:39:06,858 --> 01:39:09,225
- Where's Mama?
- She's upstairs.

1220
01:39:12,071 --> 01:39:14,028
Hi, Forrest.

1221
01:39:14,991 --> 01:39:17,529
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

1222
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:27,372
We sure got you straightened out,
didn't we, boy?

1223
01:39:38,723 --> 01:39:42,683
- What's the matter, Mama?
- I'm dying, Forrest.

1224
01:39:46,022 --> 01:39:48,389
Come on in, sit down over here.

1225
01:40:02,747 --> 01:40:06,240
- Why are you dying, Mama?
- It's my time.

1226
01:40:07,251 --> 01:40:09,117
It's just my time.

1227
01:40:10,588 --> 01:40:14,753
Now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart.

1228
01:40:16,385 --> 01:40:18,752
Death is just a part of life,

1229
01:40:19,764 --> 01:40:22,381
something we're all destined to do.

1230
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:28,597
I didn't know it,
but I was destined to be your mama.

1231
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:33,024
- I did the best I could.
- You did good, Mama.

1232
01:40:33,819 --> 01:40:38,985
Well, I happen to believe
you make your own destiny.

1233
01:40:40,493 --> 01:40:43,736
You have to do the best
with what God gave you.

1234
01:40:47,625 --> 01:40:49,742
What's my destiny, Mama?

1235
01:40:51,921 --> 01:40:55,130
You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.

1236
01:40:56,425 --> 01:40:59,384
Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.

1237
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:01,632
You never know
what you're going to get.

1238
01:41:01,764 --> 01:41:06,134
<i>Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.</i>

1239
01:41:06,227 --> 01:41:08,435
I will miss you, Forrest.

1240
01:41:10,273 --> 01:41:14,313
<i>She had got the cancer
and died on a Tuesday.</i>

1241
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:19,154
<i>I bought her a new hat
with little flowers on it.</i>

1242
01:41:22,201 --> 01:41:25,490
And that's all I have to say about that.

1243
01:41:32,336 --> 01:41:34,623
Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number seven bus?

1244
01:41:34,714 --> 01:41:37,502
There'll be another one along shortly.

1245
01:41:41,345 --> 01:41:44,929
Now, because I had been a football star,
and a war hero,

1246
01:41:45,016 --> 01:41:48,134
and a national celebrity,
and a shrimping boat captain,

1247
01:41:48,644 --> 01:41:51,853
and a college graduate,
the city fathers of Greenbow, Alabama

1248
01:41:51,981 --> 01:41:55,190
decided to get together
and offered me a fine job.

1249
01:41:56,569 --> 01:42:00,233
<i>So, I never went back to work
for Lieutenant Dan,</i>

1250
01:42:00,364 --> 01:42:03,072
<i>though he did take care
of my Bubba-Gump money.</i>

1251
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:07,786
<i>He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.</i>

1252
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:09,512
<i>And so then, I got a call from him saying</i>

1253
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:12,999
we don't have to worry about money
no more, and I said,

1254
01:42:13,085 --> 01:42:15,372
"That's good. One less thing."

1255
01:42:18,424 --> 01:42:21,792
<i>Now, Mama said there's only
so much fortune a man really needs,</i>

1256
01:42:23,054 --> 01:42:25,922
<i>and the rest is just for showing off.</i>

1257
01:42:26,015 --> 01:42:29,884
<i>So, I gave a whole bunch of it
to the Foursquare gospel church,</i>

1258
01:42:32,563 --> 01:42:37,058
<i>and I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre fishing hospital.</i>

1259
01:42:39,403 --> 01:42:43,943
<i>And even though Bubba was dead
and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,</i>

1260
01:42:44,075 --> 01:42:46,692
<i>I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.</i>

1261
01:42:50,915 --> 01:42:52,622
You know what?

1262
01:42:53,876 --> 01:42:56,869
<i>She didn't have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.</i>

1263
01:42:56,962 --> 01:42:58,578
That smells wonderful.

1264
01:42:59,423 --> 01:43:03,337
<i>And 'cause I was a gazillionaire
and I liked doing it so much,</i>

1265
01:43:03,427 --> 01:43:05,760
<i>I cut that grass for free.</i>

1266
01:43:09,558 --> 01:43:12,426
<i>But at night time
when there was nothing to do</i>

1267
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:14,887
<i>and the house was all empty,</i>

1268
01:43:15,898 --> 01:43:18,265
<i>I'd always think of Jenny.</i>

1269
01:44:21,964 --> 01:44:25,128
<i>And then, she was there.</i>

1270
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:01,289
- Hello, Forrest.
- Hello, Jenny.

1271
01:45:12,848 --> 01:45:15,465
<i>Jenny came back and stayed with me.</i>

1272
01:45:17,061 --> 01:45:20,725
<i>Maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go,</i>

1273
01:45:20,856 --> 01:45:24,566
<i>or maybe it was because she was
so tired, 'cause she went to bed</i>

1274
01:45:24,693 --> 01:45:28,653
<i>and slept and slept,
like she hadn't slept in years.</i>

1275
01:45:29,907 --> 01:45:32,194
<i>It was wonderful having her home.</i>

1276
01:45:33,536 --> 01:45:38,656
<i>Every day we'd take a walk and
I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree,</i>

1277
01:45:38,749 --> 01:45:41,287
<i>and she'd listen about Ping-Ponging,
and shrimping,</i>

1278
01:45:41,377 --> 01:45:45,667
<i>and Mama making a trip up to heaven.
I did all the talking.</i>

1279
01:45:45,756 --> 01:45:49,090
<i>Jenny most of the time was real quiet.</i>

1280
01:46:29,258 --> 01:46:32,467
How could you do this?

1281
01:47:09,423 --> 01:47:12,757
<i>Sometimes I guess there
just aren't enough rocks.</i>

1282
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:19,465
<i>I never really knew why she came back,
but I didn't care.</i>

1283
01:47:19,642 --> 01:47:23,932
<i>It was like olden times.
We was like peas and carrots again.</i>

1284
01:47:26,023 --> 01:47:30,358
<i>Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers
and put them in her room for her,</i>

1285
01:47:31,862 --> 01:47:35,446
<i>and she gave me the best gift anyone
could ever get in the wide world.</i>

1286
01:47:35,532 --> 01:47:38,366
- New shoes.
- They make them just for running.

1287
01:47:43,374 --> 01:47:46,663
<i>And she even showed me
how to dance.</i>

1288
01:47:54,843 --> 01:47:59,053
<i>And, well, we was like family,
Jenny and me.</i>

1289
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:05,723
<i>And it was the happiest time in my life.</i>

1290
01:48:25,374 --> 01:48:27,161
<i>...and this Fourth is witnessing
one of the</i>

1291
01:48:27,251 --> 01:48:30,244
<i>largest fireworks displays
in the nation's...</i>

1292
01:48:30,337 --> 01:48:33,250
- You done watching it?
<i>- ...here in New York Harbor...</i>

1293
01:48:33,382 --> 01:48:35,235
- I'm going to bed.
<i>- ...with a spectacular display</i>

1294
01:48:35,259 --> 01:48:38,297
<i>of tall ships earlier.
The Statue of Liberty...</i>

1295
01:48:45,352 --> 01:48:47,344
Will you marry me?

1296
01:48:52,276 --> 01:48:55,235
I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

1297
01:48:57,906 --> 01:48:59,943
You would, Forrest.

1298
01:49:01,785 --> 01:49:04,118
But you won't marry me.

1299
01:49:06,415 --> 01:49:08,623
You don't want to marry me.

1300
01:49:12,212 --> 01:49:14,625
Why don't you love me, Jenny?

1301
01:49:19,636 --> 01:49:21,753
I'm not a smart man,

1302
01:49:23,474 --> 01:49:25,887
but I know what love is.

1303
01:50:02,930 --> 01:50:04,171
Jenny.

1304
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:08,592
Forrest, I do love you.

1305
01:51:01,738 --> 01:51:05,402
- Where are you running off to?
- I'm not running.

1306
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:42,337
<i>That day, for no particular reason,
I decided to go for a little run.</i>

1307
01:52:43,507 --> 01:52:47,922
<i>So, I ran to the end of the road,
and when I got there,</i>

1308
01:52:48,011 --> 01:52:49,752
<i>I thought maybe I'd run
to the end of town.</i>

1309
01:52:49,846 --> 01:52:53,089
<i>President Carter, suffering from heat
exhaustion, fell into the arms of...</i>

1310
01:52:53,183 --> 01:52:54,845
<i>And when I got there,</i>

1311
01:52:54,935 --> 01:52:59,100
<i>I thought maybe I'd just
run across Greenbow County.</i>

1312
01:52:59,189 --> 01:53:01,602
<i>And I figured since I'd run this far,</i>

1313
01:53:01,692 --> 01:53:04,935
<i>maybe I'd just run across
the great state of Alabama.</i>

1314
01:53:05,028 --> 01:53:06,235
<i>And that's what I did.</i>

1315
01:53:06,863 --> 01:53:08,650
I ran clear across Alabama.

1316
01:53:09,700 --> 01:53:12,864
For no particular reason,
I just kept on going.

1317
01:53:14,204 --> 01:53:15,786
I ran clear to the ocean.

1318
01:53:21,670 --> 01:53:24,834
<i>And when I got there,
I figured since I'd gone this far,</i>

1319
01:53:25,382 --> 01:53:28,216
<i>might as well turn around
and just keep on going.</i>

1320
01:53:31,972 --> 01:53:36,558
<i>And when I got to another ocean,
I figured since I'd gone this far,</i>

1321
01:53:38,353 --> 01:53:42,063
<i>I might as well just turn back
and keep right on going.</i>

1322
01:53:43,233 --> 01:53:48,069
<i>When I got tired, I slept.
When I got hungry, I ate.</i>

1323
01:53:48,155 --> 01:53:51,193
When I had to go, you know...

1324
01:53:52,826 --> 01:53:53,987
I went.

1325
01:53:54,077 --> 01:53:57,070
And so, you just ran.

1326
01:53:58,832 --> 01:53:59,913
Yeah.

1327
01:54:35,202 --> 01:54:40,448
<i>I'd think a lot about Mama
and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.</i>

1328
01:54:41,458 --> 01:54:44,951
<i>But most of all, I thought about Jenny.</i>

1329
01:54:46,046 --> 01:54:48,208
<i>I thought about her a lot.</i>

1330
01:54:48,965 --> 01:54:52,049
<i>For more than two years now,
a man named Forrest Gump,</i>

1331
01:54:52,135 --> 01:54:55,549
<i>a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,
stopping only to sleep,</i>

1332
01:54:55,639 --> 01:54:57,801
<i>has been running across America.</i>

1333
01:54:57,891 --> 01:54:59,883
<i>Charles Cooper brings us this report.</i>

1334
01:55:00,811 --> 01:55:03,224
<i>For the fourth time
on his journey across America,</i>

1335
01:55:03,313 --> 01:55:06,147
<i>Forrest Gump,
the gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,</i>

1336
01:55:06,274 --> 01:55:09,142
<i>is about to cross
the Mississippi River again today.</i>

1337
01:55:09,778 --> 01:55:11,881
- I'll be damned. Forrest?
<i>- Sir, why are you running?</i>

1338
01:55:11,905 --> 01:55:12,986
Why are you running?

1339
01:55:13,073 --> 01:55:14,655
Are you doing this for world peace?

1340
01:55:14,741 --> 01:55:16,135
Are you doing this for the homeless?

1341
01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:19,152
- Are you running for women's rights?
- Or for the environment?

1342
01:55:19,246 --> 01:55:20,246
Or for animals?

1343
01:55:20,330 --> 01:55:23,243
<i>They just couldn't believe that
somebody would do all that running</i>

1344
01:55:23,333 --> 01:55:24,699
<i>for no particular reason.</i>

1345
01:55:24,793 --> 01:55:26,750
Why are you doing this?

1346
01:55:26,837 --> 01:55:29,329
I just felt like running.

1347
01:55:29,464 --> 01:55:31,831
I just felt like running.

1348
01:55:31,967 --> 01:55:35,176
It's you. I can't believe it's really you.

1349
01:55:36,012 --> 01:55:41,132
Now, for some reason, what I was doing
seemed to make sense to people.

1350
01:55:41,309 --> 01:55:43,496
I mean, it was like an alarm
went off in my head, you know?

1351
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:45,456
I said,
"Here's a guy that's got his act together.

1352
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:47,437
"Here's somebody
who's got it all figured out.

1353
01:55:47,524 --> 01:55:51,609
"Here's somebody who has the answer."
I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump.

1354
01:55:51,695 --> 01:55:53,527
<i>So, I got company.</i>

1355
01:55:55,365 --> 01:56:01,202
<i>And after that, I got more company.
And then, even more people joined in.</i>

1356
01:56:03,665 --> 01:56:06,874
Somebody later told me
it gave people hope.

1357
01:56:08,670 --> 01:56:12,038
Now... Now, I don't know
anything about that,

1358
01:56:12,883 --> 01:56:15,466
<i>but some of those people
asked me if I could help them out.</i>

1359
01:56:15,677 --> 01:56:18,920
Hey, man, hey, listen, I was wondering
if you might help me, huh?

1360
01:56:19,014 --> 01:56:20,755
Listen, I'm in the
bumper sticker business

1361
01:56:20,849 --> 01:56:22,660
and I've been trying
to think up a good slogan.

1362
01:56:22,684 --> 01:56:25,802
And since you have been such a big
inspiration to the people around here,

1363
01:56:25,896 --> 01:56:27,874
I thought you might
be able to help me jump into...

1364
01:56:27,898 --> 01:56:31,517
Whoa, man! You just ran through
a big pile of dog shit!

1365
01:56:33,069 --> 01:56:35,732
- It happens.
- What, shit?

1366
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:39,197
Sometimes.

1367
01:56:41,077 --> 01:56:43,740
<i>And some years later,
I heard that that fellow</i>

1368
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:45,446
<i>did come up with
a bumper sticker slogan,</i>

1369
01:56:45,540 --> 01:56:48,749
<i>and he made a lot of money off of it.</i>

1370
01:56:50,212 --> 01:56:52,420
<i>Another time, I was running along,</i>

1371
01:56:52,547 --> 01:56:55,836
<i>somebody who had lost all his money
in the T-shirt business,</i>

1372
01:56:55,926 --> 01:56:57,963
<i>he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt,</i>

1373
01:56:58,053 --> 01:57:01,012
<i>but he couldn't draw that well,
and he didn't have a camera.</i>

1374
01:57:01,097 --> 01:57:04,590
Here, use this one.
Nobody likes that color anyway.

1375
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:11,101
Have a nice day.

1376
01:57:12,734 --> 01:57:13,850
<i>Well, some years later,</i>

1377
01:57:13,944 --> 01:57:17,858
<i>I found out that that man
did come up with an idea for a T-shirt.</i>

1378
01:57:17,948 --> 01:57:20,315
<i>He made a lot of money off of it.</i>

1379
01:57:23,119 --> 01:57:27,534
<i>Anyway, like I was saying,
I had a lot of company.</i>

1380
01:57:28,792 --> 01:57:29,953
<i>My mama always said,</i>

1381
01:57:30,043 --> 01:57:34,458
<i>"You got to put the past behind you
before you can move on."</i>

1382
01:57:36,132 --> 01:57:39,466
<i>And I think that's what
my running was all about.</i>

1383
01:57:40,303 --> 01:57:44,297
<i>I had run for three years, two months,</i>

1384
01:57:44,558 --> 01:57:46,891
<i>14 days and 16 hours.</i>

1385
01:58:02,576 --> 01:58:04,909
Quiet. Quiet.
He's going to say something.

1386
01:58:16,339 --> 01:58:18,080
I'm pretty tired.

1387
01:58:20,927 --> 01:58:22,964
Think I'll go home now.

1388
01:58:41,531 --> 01:58:43,989
Now what are we supposed to do?

1389
01:58:44,951 --> 01:58:49,195
<i>And just like that,
my running days was over.</i>

1390
01:58:51,166 --> 01:58:52,907
<i>So, I went home to Alabama.</i>

1391
01:58:53,710 --> 01:58:57,875
<i>Moments ago, at 2:25 p.m.,
as President Reagan was leaving the...</i>

1392
01:58:59,633 --> 01:59:03,798
<i>...five or six gunshots were fired
by an unknown would-be assassin.</i>

1393
01:59:04,304 --> 01:59:06,637
<i>The President was shot in the chest,
and the assailant...</i>

1394
01:59:06,723 --> 01:59:08,680
I picked up the mail.

1395
01:59:09,476 --> 01:59:13,311
And one day, out of the blue clear sky,
I got a letter from Jenny,

1396
01:59:13,396 --> 01:59:17,640
wondering if I could come down
to Savannah and see her,

1397
01:59:17,734 --> 01:59:20,317
and that's what I'm doing here.

1398
01:59:20,403 --> 01:59:22,986
She saw me on TV, running.

1399
01:59:23,073 --> 01:59:27,317
I'm supposed to go on the
number nine bus to Richmond Street

1400
01:59:27,410 --> 01:59:34,328
and get off and go one block left
to 1947 Henry Street, Apartment 4.

1401
01:59:34,417 --> 01:59:38,081
Why, you don't need to take a bus.

1402
01:59:38,213 --> 01:59:42,753
Henry Street is just five
or six blocks down that way.

1403
01:59:44,594 --> 01:59:46,927
- Down that way?
- Down that way.

1404
01:59:49,933 --> 01:59:51,845
It was nice talking to you.

1405
01:59:52,894 --> 01:59:55,511
I hope everything works out for you!

1406
02:00:03,279 --> 02:00:04,941
Hey!

1407
02:00:05,365 --> 02:00:07,027
Forrest!

1408
02:00:07,283 --> 02:00:10,526
How you doing? Come in, come in!

1409
02:00:10,620 --> 02:00:11,827
I got your letter.

1410
02:00:11,913 --> 02:00:14,530
I was wondering about that.

1411
02:00:16,084 --> 02:00:17,871
Is this your house?

1412
02:00:17,961 --> 02:00:21,045
Yeah. It's messy right now.
I just got off work.

1413
02:00:21,131 --> 02:00:24,841
It's nice. You got air conditioning.

1414
02:00:31,725 --> 02:00:33,762
- Thank you.
- I ate some.

1415
02:00:36,563 --> 02:00:41,979
Hey, I kept a scrapbook
of your clippings and everything.

1416
02:00:42,110 --> 02:00:43,726
There you are.

1417
02:00:45,488 --> 02:00:46,608
And this, I got you running.

1418
02:00:49,659 --> 02:00:51,821
I ran a long way,

1419
02:00:52,328 --> 02:00:54,160
for a long time.

1420
02:00:56,374 --> 02:00:57,865
And there...

1421
02:01:04,382 --> 02:01:07,841
Listen, Forrest,
I don't know how to say this.

1422
02:01:10,346 --> 02:01:14,681
I just I want to apologize
for anything that I ever did to you,

1423
02:01:14,809 --> 02:01:20,055
'cause I was messed up
for a long time, and...

1424
02:01:22,859 --> 02:01:24,475
- Hey.
- Hi.

1425
02:01:24,694 --> 02:01:25,694
Hey, you.

1426
02:01:26,863 --> 02:01:29,822
- This is an old friend from Alabama.
- How do you do?

1427
02:01:29,908 --> 02:01:32,992
Listen, next week my schedule changes,
so I'll be able to... But thanks...

1428
02:01:33,077 --> 02:01:35,114
No problem. Got to go, Jen,
I'm double-parked.

1429
02:01:35,205 --> 02:01:37,071
- Okay. Thanks.
- Bye.

1430
02:01:40,543 --> 02:01:43,286
This is my very good friend, Mr. Gump.
Can you say hi to him?

1431
02:01:43,379 --> 02:01:46,463
- Hello, Mr. Gump.
- Hello.

1432
02:01:46,549 --> 02:01:49,542
- Can I go watch TV now?
- Yes, you can. Just keep it low.

1433
02:01:52,388 --> 02:01:55,722
- You're a mama, Jenny.
- I'm a mama.

1434
02:01:58,603 --> 02:02:00,435
His name's Forrest.

1435
02:02:01,564 --> 02:02:02,896
Like me.

1436
02:02:04,526 --> 02:02:06,643
I named him after his daddy.

1437
02:02:07,612 --> 02:02:10,070
He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

1438
02:02:11,366 --> 02:02:13,403
You're his daddy, Forrest.

1439
02:02:27,882 --> 02:02:29,089
Hey.

1440
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:33,128
Forrest, look at me.
Look at me, Forrest.

1441
02:02:35,723 --> 02:02:39,842
There's nothing you need to do, okay?
You didn't do anything wrong.

1442
02:02:40,395 --> 02:02:41,761
Okay?

1443
02:02:46,109 --> 02:02:47,975
Isn't he beautiful?

1444
02:02:48,987 --> 02:02:51,946
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1445
02:02:55,743 --> 02:02:56,824
But...

1446
02:03:00,498 --> 02:03:03,366
Is he smart, or...

1447
02:03:03,459 --> 02:03:07,453
He's very smart.
He's one of the smartest in his class.

1448
02:03:16,806 --> 02:03:19,264
Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.

1449
02:03:28,610 --> 02:03:31,444
- What are you watching?
- Bert and Ernie.

1450
02:03:54,552 --> 02:03:56,339
Forrest,

1451
02:03:57,805 --> 02:03:59,341
I'm sick.

1452
02:04:02,018 --> 02:04:05,637
What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?

1453
02:04:05,730 --> 02:04:08,097
I have some kind of virus,

1454
02:04:08,191 --> 02:04:10,899
and the doctors don't...
They don't know what it is,

1455
02:04:11,027 --> 02:04:14,020
and there isn't anything
they can do about it.

1456
02:04:18,409 --> 02:04:20,696
You could come home with me.

1457
02:04:22,372 --> 02:04:28,039
Jenny, you and little Forrest could
come stay at my house in Greenbow.

1458
02:04:32,382 --> 02:04:35,170
I'll take care of you if you're sick.

1459
02:04:37,553 --> 02:04:39,840
Would you marry me, Forrest?

1460
02:04:45,103 --> 02:04:46,344
Okay.

1461
02:04:47,397 --> 02:04:49,059
Please take your seats.

1462
02:04:52,902 --> 02:04:55,235
Forrest? It's time to start.

1463
02:05:14,632 --> 02:05:16,214
Hi.

1464
02:05:17,093 --> 02:05:18,584
Your tie.

1465
02:05:31,149 --> 02:05:32,765
Lieutenant Dan.

1466
02:05:48,124 --> 02:05:50,081
Lieutenant Dan.

1467
02:05:50,918 --> 02:05:52,580
Hello, Forrest.

1468
02:05:53,254 --> 02:05:55,917
You got new legs. New legs!

1469
02:05:57,133 --> 02:06:00,922
Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made.

1470
02:06:01,637 --> 02:06:05,631
Titanium alloy.
It's what they use on the space shuttle.

1471
02:06:09,479 --> 02:06:10,970
Magic legs.

1472
02:06:12,982 --> 02:06:17,352
This is my fiancée, Susan.

1473
02:06:20,156 --> 02:06:23,524
- Lieutenant Dan.
- Hi, Forrest.

1474
02:06:25,620 --> 02:06:28,829
Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.

1475
02:06:29,207 --> 02:06:32,200
Hey. It's nice to meet you finally.

1476
02:06:42,345 --> 02:06:46,510
Do you, Forrest,
take Jenny to be your wife?

1477
02:06:48,392 --> 02:06:52,636
Do you, Jenny,
take Forrest to be your husband?

1478
02:06:53,981 --> 02:06:57,349
And so I pronounce you man and wife.

1479
02:07:28,224 --> 02:07:30,090
- Hey.
- Hey.

1480
02:07:43,781 --> 02:07:45,568
Hey, Forrest.

1481
02:07:50,913 --> 02:07:52,700
Were you scared in Vietnam?

1482
02:07:54,375 --> 02:07:56,708
Yes. Well, I...

1483
02:07:58,045 --> 02:07:59,752
I don't know.

1484
02:08:00,464 --> 02:08:05,425
<i>Sometimes it would stop raining long
enough for the stars to come out.</i>

1485
02:08:08,556 --> 02:08:10,593
<i>And then it was nice.</i>

1486
02:08:13,978 --> 02:08:17,938
It was like just before the sun
goes to bed down on the bayou.

1487
02:08:19,233 --> 02:08:23,102
<i>There was always
a million sparkles on the water.</i>

1488
02:08:24,906 --> 02:08:28,820
<i>Like that mountain lake.
It was so clear, Jenny,</i>

1489
02:08:28,951 --> 02:08:33,537
<i>it looked like there were two skies,
one on top of the other.</i>

1490
02:08:36,083 --> 02:08:39,121
And then, in the desert,
when the sun comes up,

1491
02:08:41,589 --> 02:08:45,754
<i>I couldn't tell where heaven stopped</i>

1492
02:08:46,302 --> 02:08:48,669
<i>and the earth began.</i>

1493
02:08:49,931 --> 02:08:51,797
<i>It was so beautiful.</i>

1494
02:08:56,520 --> 02:08:59,604
I wish I could've been there with you.

1495
02:09:02,693 --> 02:09:04,104
You were.

1496
02:09:14,830 --> 02:09:16,287
I love you.

1497
02:09:20,670 --> 02:09:24,004
<i>You died on a Saturday morning.</i>

1498
02:09:25,716 --> 02:09:29,460
And I had you placed
here under our tree.

1499
02:09:34,350 --> 02:09:39,186
And I had that house of your father's
bulldozed to the ground.

1500
02:09:43,317 --> 02:09:44,979
<i>Mama</i>

1501
02:09:46,070 --> 02:09:51,065
always said that dying was a part of life.

1502
02:09:54,495 --> 02:09:56,828
I sure wish it wasn't.

1503
02:09:59,500 --> 02:10:03,244
Little Forrest is doing just fine.

1504
02:10:04,588 --> 02:10:05,669
But...

1505
02:10:05,923 --> 02:10:08,586
<i>About to start school again soon,</i>

1506
02:10:10,428 --> 02:10:14,217
and I make his breakfast, lunch
and dinner every day.

1507
02:10:16,392 --> 02:10:22,389
I make sure he combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day.

1508
02:10:25,526 --> 02:10:28,109
Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.

1509
02:10:29,405 --> 02:10:30,441
Okay.

1510
02:10:30,698 --> 02:10:31,859
<i>He's really good.</i>

1511
02:10:31,949 --> 02:10:34,066
Forrest, you go.

1512
02:10:38,289 --> 02:10:39,871
<i>We fish a lot.</i>

1513
02:10:43,419 --> 02:10:46,878
And every night, we read a book.
He's so smart, Jenny.

1514
02:10:50,134 --> 02:10:52,376
You'd be so proud of him.

1515
02:10:54,096 --> 02:10:55,553
I am.

1516
02:10:56,599 --> 02:10:59,808
He wrote you a letter.

1517
02:11:01,395 --> 02:11:03,432
And he says I can't read it.

1518
02:11:03,564 --> 02:11:07,103
I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you.

1519
02:11:23,167 --> 02:11:24,499
Jenny,

1520
02:11:30,299 --> 02:11:33,508
I don't know if Mama was right,

1521
02:11:34,845 --> 02:11:36,336
or if it's Lieutenant Dan.

1522
02:11:36,472 --> 02:11:39,055
I don't know

1523
02:11:39,141 --> 02:11:43,636
if we each have a destiny,

1524
02:11:45,689 --> 02:11:50,809
or if we're all just floating around
accidental-like on a breeze.

1525
02:11:55,324 --> 02:11:57,156
But I think

1526
02:11:59,036 --> 02:12:00,823
maybe it's both.

1527
02:12:05,167 --> 02:12:08,035
Maybe both is happening
at the same time.

1528
02:12:14,176 --> 02:12:16,168
But I miss you, Jenny.

1529
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:26,975
If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.

1530
02:13:02,266 --> 02:13:05,225
Here's your bus. Okay.

1531
02:13:06,896 --> 02:13:10,230
Hey. I know this.

1532
02:13:10,357 --> 02:13:13,225
I'm gonna show that
for show-and-tell because

1533
02:13:13,360 --> 02:13:16,023
Grandma used to read it to you.

1534
02:13:16,113 --> 02:13:18,230
My favorite book.

1535
02:13:21,577 --> 02:13:23,068
Here we are.

1536
02:13:23,245 --> 02:13:24,702
Okay.

1537
02:13:26,415 --> 02:13:27,906
Here you go.

1538
02:13:32,796 --> 02:13:35,288
Hey, Forrest, don't...

1539
02:13:38,761 --> 02:13:42,471
- I wanted to tell you, I love you.
- I love you, too, Daddy.

1540
02:13:44,475 --> 02:13:47,263
I'll be right here when you get back.

1541
02:13:51,815 --> 02:13:55,058
You understand this is
the bus to school, now, don't you?

1542
02:13:55,152 --> 02:13:58,691
Of course, and you are Dorothy Harris,
and I'm Forrest Gump.
