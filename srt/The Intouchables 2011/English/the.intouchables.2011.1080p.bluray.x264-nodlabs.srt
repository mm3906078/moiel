1
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,891
Outta the way!

2
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,327
Here they come.

3
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,372
Philippe, 100 euros
says I can lose them.

4
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,333
- Philippe.
- You're on.

5
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,001
Here we go.

6
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,284
You're in shape. God!

7
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,372
Shit!

8
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,007
Fuck!

9
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,167
So you lost them?

10
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,883
Get out! Hands on the hood!

11
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,595
- Get out!
- Two hundred says I get an escort.

12
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,384
You'll lose again.

13
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,098
- Two hundred, an escort!
- You're on.

14
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,808
Let's see your hands!

15
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,518
Your goddamn hands!

16
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,642
Let me explain.

17
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,857
Shut your mouth
and put your hands on the hood!

18
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,020
Hold on.

19
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,362
- Let go!
- I said get out!

20
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,027
He can't get out!

21
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,661
He can't even open the door!

22
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,913
- What?
- Look at the sticker!

23
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,541
There's a wheelchair in the trunk!

24
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,077
Go and check!

25
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,665
T ake a look.

26
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,296
Let go of me.

27
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,795
Yeah.

28
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,506
Well?

29
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,045
What is this?

30
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,181
You think I drive that fast
for the hell of it?

31
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,182
We're heading for the hospital.

32
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,309
He's having a fit, OK.

33
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,765
It's an emergency!

34
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,931
He can't move! I'm his caregiver.

35
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,645
We have a problem.

36
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,518
Look.

37
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,522
What do we do?

38
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,113
Know what? Think it over.
T ake your time.

39
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,654
Then call his kid and say
you killed her dad!

40
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,118
In five minutes, he'll be a goner,

41
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,829
dead as a dodo.

42
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,209
So take your time.

43
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,255
Go on, think it over!
While he croaks.

44
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,583
OK, get going.

45
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,016
- Where are you heading?
- The ER.

46
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,151
We'll escort you, it's safer.

47
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,654
We're escorting them. Let's go!

48
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,947
It's OK, they're splitting.

49
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,280
This is really gross, Philippe.

50
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,700
Freaks me out.
How do you produce this stuff?

51
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:58,120
Maybe you should take
that driving test now.

52
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,540
Yes, but for now,
"We'll escort you, it's safer."

53
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,174
An escort at 200 euros.

54
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,631
I never wager such large sums.

55
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,221
This calls for a change of mood.

56
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,049
"We'll escort you, it's safer."

57
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:14,345
Come on, I helped you out.

58
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,268
Philippe, the escort.

59
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,858
The escort, it's safer.

60
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,192
We'll escort you, it's safer!

61
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,370
Here he comes.

62
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,079
They're bringing a stretcher.
You'll be OK?

63
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,872
- Yes, fine.
- Good luck.

64
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,040
Goodbye.

65
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,599
What do we do now?

66
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,193
You let me handle it now.

67
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,465
Any references?

68
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,676
Yes, I have a DAHC,

69
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,801
a Diploma in Advanced Home Care.

70
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:46,064
I backed it up with training
at the Bayer Institute in 2001.

71
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,190
I studied social work at school,

72
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,774
then did a course
in social and family economics.

73
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,405
Actually, the thing is...

74
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,988
I've done more studying
than working.

75
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,702
What is your key motivation?

76
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,704
Money.

77
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:03,824
The man.

78
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,076
I'm totally into that.

79
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:07,835
That's nice.

80
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,042
Helping others, I think.

81
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,423
Is that OK? Did I get it right?

82
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,338
The neighborhood.

83
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,377
I like crippled people,

84
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,046
since I was little.

85
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,884
Working to make the handicapped
independent,

86
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,222
on a social level.

87
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,887
Sport too. You need to move.

88
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,685
To fit in with life.

89
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,226
These people can't do a thing.

90
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,021
I had
my first professional experience...

91
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,273
That was Mrs. Dupont-Moretti...

92
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,658
A very old lady...

93
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:41,736
...really very old...

94
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:46,375
...whom I cared for until the end.

95
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,411
There were fun times
in the geriatric unit

96
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,045
at Halloween and so on.

97
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:55,380
I'm also an expert
with bureaucracy.

98
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,340
Housing grants, for instance.

99
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,096
I don't know. Maybe...

100
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,591
...you get one?

101
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,761
Check, Magalie,
but somehow I doubt it.

102
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,737
- Yvan Laprade?
- Yes.

103
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:16,896
Enough.

104
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,649
- I'm Laprade.
- I'm sick of waiting.

105
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:26,906
Hello.

106
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,412
I need a signature.

107
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,536
Have a seat.

108
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,593
Any references?

109
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,721
- I have plenty.
- All right.

110
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,555
We're listening.

111
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,513
Kool and the Gang,
Earth, Wind & Fire.

112
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,227
Good references?

113
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,514
I don't know them. Sit down.

114
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,268
You know nothing about music.

115
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,357
I'm no ignoramus
when it comes to music

116
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,568
even if I don't know Cruel...

117
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,733
- Kool and the Gang.
- And you?

118
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,493
Do you know Chopin,
Schubert or Berlioz?

119
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,745
Do I know Berlioz?

120
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,915
I bet you don't!

121
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,205
I'm a specialist.

122
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,368
Oh yeah?

123
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,788
Who do you know there?

124
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,456
Which building?

125
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,463
What do you mean?

126
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,253
Before becoming a housing project,

127
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:26,220
Berlioz was a 19th century composer,
writer and critic.

128
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:30,478
Bullshit. I know who Berlioz is.
Humor's like music for you.

129
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,772
You suck at both.

130
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,611
You need a signature?

131
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,698
Yeah, to say
I applied for the job...

132
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,993
...but that despite
my obvious qualities...

133
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,580
Just put the usual spiel
about not being interested.

134
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,412
I need three refusals
to get the benefit.

135
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,672
I see, your benefit.

136
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,378
Any other motivations?

137
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,541
Yes, plenty.

138
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,636
One right here.

139
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,672
Very motivating in fact.

140
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,726
OK, I'm having a blast,
but what do we do?

141
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:11,977
Sign or not?

142
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,430
I can't sign right now.

143
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,766
- Why not?
- Why not?

144
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,863
That's a bummer.

145
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,870
I'm already late handing it in.

146
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,622
That's a bummer as you say.

147
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:41,211
- Can't Ms. Motivation sign for you?
- Magalie isn't authorized.

148
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:47,427
T oo bad, she could have added
her cell number.

149
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,304
Pick it up tomorrow at nine.

150
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,935
I'd hate to deprive you
of your benefit.

151
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:54,478
I won't see you out.

152
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,264
No, don't get up.

153
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,899
I mean, stay seated.

154
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,273
I'll come back tomorrow.

155
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,861
Mina, is she here?

156
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,526
No, she'll be back late.

157
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,617
No!

158
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:01,455
Turn the tap off
or I don't have any water!

159
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,789
Turn the tap off!

160
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,582
Get out of here!

161
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,092
I'm taking a shower!

162
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,877
- Leave me be!
- Out!

163
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,845
Get them out.

164
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,005
Go on.

165
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,015
Bintou, I'm serious!

166
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,175
Mina!

167
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,052
Get them out!

168
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,936
Get out with your big belly.

169
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,438
Let go!

170
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,019
Get out!

171
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,354
Out, you lot!

172
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,813
Get it?

173
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,944
- Hey, Bintou.
- Let go!

174
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,776
Bintou, what the hell?

175
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,615
Sit down, you!

176
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,053
- Where were you?
- At school.

177
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,934
Where are you going?

178
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,515
Horse-riding.

179
00:14:58,689 --> 00:14:59,678
Wise guy.

180
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,727
Here, it's for you.

181
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:43,806
Where were you?

182
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,942
On vacation.

183
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,108
People talk around here.

184
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,189
You think I'm a dumb bitch?

185
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,241
Six months without seeing you.

186
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,277
Not one phone call.
Nothing!

187
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,072
And now you turn up
with a Kinder egg?

188
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,576
You think your scams
will pay for the rent,

189
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,833
for food?

190
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,836
You think this is a hotel?

191
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,135
Look at me when I talk to you!

192
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,722
Idiot!

193
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,675
There's no talking to you!

194
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:20,968
Want to talk?

195
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,356
I'm listening.

196
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,898
I'm listening.

197
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,786
You know, Driss,

198
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,288
I've done a lot of praying for you.

199
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,284
But, God forgive me,

200
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:45,668
I have other children.

201
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,417
I still have hope for them.

202
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,343
I don't want you coming back here.

203
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:59,136
Just pack up your bags
and get the hell out.

204
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,516
Is that clear?

205
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,560
Get out.

206
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,472
Get out!

207
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,097
That was a good one, right?

208
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,480
Know what? I'm going.

209
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,356
- It wasn't funny?
- Forget it.

210
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,063
It wasn't funny?

211
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,916
- Yes?
- It's for my paper.

212
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,043
- I was expecting you.
- About...

213
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,796
- Come in.
-...my benefit.

214
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,055
T ell Philippe he's here.

215
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,603
Right away.

216
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,059
Well?

217
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,775
No beetroot,
but the radishes are nearly ready.

218
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:00,904
Good.

219
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,064
Hello.

220
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,623
Come along.

221
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,081
I'm warning you, he had a bad night.

222
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,584
Like you apparently.

223
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,968
His day begins at 7:00 a.m.
with the nurse.

224
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:25,050
He needs two to three hours of care
each morning.

225
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,842
Many applicants throw in the towel
after a week.

226
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,430
We see a lot of them.

227
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,728
I like the decor,
the music and all the rest,

228
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,813
but I'm not buying
and I have stuff to do.

229
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,480
I was told to show you around.

230
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,114
Anyhow, it's nearly over.

231
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,531
T o communicate,
you have a baby monitor.

232
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,661
It's like a walkie-talkie.

233
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,124
Under the terms of the contract,
you have your own quarters.

234
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,876
This is the toilet.

235
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,549
And you have a separate bathroom.

236
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,921
This way.

237
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,855
He's expecting you.

238
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,149
Just a minute.

239
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,750
I had your paper signed.

240
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,165
It's on the table over there.

241
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,174
So you like being assisted?

242
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,054
What?

243
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,470
You don't mind
living off others' backs?

244
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,639
It's not a problem for you?

245
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,273
No. How about you?

246
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:07,737
Do you think you're capable of working?
With constraints, regular hours,

247
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,070
responsibilities...

248
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,906
A sense of humor after all.

249
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,746
And I'm ready to try you out
for a month.

250
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,199
You have a day to think it over.

251
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,211
I bet you won't last two weeks.

252
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,821
What?

253
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,236
No bone,

254
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:56,281
no muscle should be ignored.
Move them all.

255
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,541
Keep the skin and joints
in good condition.

256
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:03,955
T o do that,
you need to be meticulous,

257
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:07,375
and strict.
All right? Is that clear?

258
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,259
Wake up!

259
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,886
You sleep at night!

260
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,136
I'm not asleep.

261
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:13,343
Help me.

262
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,433
Let's put Philippe in his chair...

263
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,307
...and get him to the shower.

264
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,268
I know...

265
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:24,892
Try it on your own. Show me.

266
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,151
Don't be scared. Go on.

267
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,740
I'm not scared.

268
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:49,291
Happy now?

269
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:53,425
Never let him go
until he's strapped in.

270
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,306
Yes, I'm kinky that way.

271
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,308
No one told me.

272
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,225
I'm in training.

273
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:07,185
Do you want white gloves or what?
Scrub away!

274
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,230
The shampoo's weird,
it won't lather.

275
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,023
- How's it going?
- It won't lather.

276
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,862
What?

277
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,323
I don't believe it.

278
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,704
That's his foot cream.

279
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,331
Hold on.

280
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,577
Don't tell me you can't read, Driss!

281
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:25,915
Sure I can, but...

282
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,129
You seem pretty gifted.

283
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,212
Usually it's one for the whole body.

284
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:32,547
This guy has 20.

285
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,591
I'm not spending all day here.

286
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:36,881
This one then?

287
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,720
The one marked shampoo.

288
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,227
Will you manage?

289
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:43,979
Of course he will.

290
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,773
My feet are beautifully coiffed.

291
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,352
Go and have lunch, Marcelle.

292
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,359
Where's the skirt?

293
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:57,986
They're support stockings.
They help the blood to flow properly

294
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,369
so I don't faint.

295
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:04,663
I'm not doing that.

296
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,210
There's a problem here.

297
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,709
Seeing as how I won't be doing it,

298
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:13,250
we need to see if...
Marcelle!

299
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:17,138
Maybe Marcelle could come back
to put them on you.

300
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:21,266
She knows how to do it,
being a chick and all that...

301
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,769
I'm just not doing it, OK.

302
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,645
You're better off fainting.

303
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,397
I mean, sometimes...

304
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:30,393
We just refuse to put them on.
We're men.

305
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:31,777
No way, Marcelle!

306
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,289
You're good with stockings.

307
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,293
Only natural with that cute earring.

308
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,745
Can we cut the joking?

309
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,298
You're a natural at this.

310
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,710
Haven't you ever considered work...

311
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,595
...as a beautician?

312
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,301
OK, that's done.

313
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,936
What are the gloves for?

314
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:10,441
Let's wait a while.
You're not quite ready for that yet.

315
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,939
No, he's not quite ready.

316
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,901
What do you mean,
not ready for what?

317
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,319
- What is this?
- We'll explain.

318
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:22,407
We need to talk, Marcelle!
This training's not working.

319
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,329
Ready or not,

320
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,458
I'm not emptying the ass
of a guy I don't know.

321
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,077
Or even of a guy I do know.

322
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,042
I don't empty anyone's ass,
on principle.

323
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,504
Can I finish eating first?

324
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:43,465
No.

325
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,968
Let's just leave it at this.

326
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,603
I don't go for this sick stuff.

327
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,732
The stockings were bad enough.

328
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,767
But I met you part way.

329
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:57,313
Your turn.
Drop the ass emptying.

330
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:58,856
- I get the message.
- It's wrong.

331
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,365
Just drop it.

332
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:01,696
Enjoy your lunch.

333
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:09,957
Beautiful, huh?

334
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,335
I love it.

335
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,380
Don't mind me.

336
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:22,096
You're not at the movies,
I'm eating here.

337
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,591
Hi. Where can I find a beer?

338
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,476
Maybe in your wig.

339
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:30,805
You took both packs?

340
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,268
No idea. I don't care.

341
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,057
Take your mop-head for a walk.

342
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,730
Let's go.

343
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,270
He's the guy my dad hired.

344
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,779
Oh, right.

345
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,531
The guy has a name.

346
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,602
- What?
- Sorry.

347
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,387
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

348
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:14,147
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

349
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,521
Just massaging away.

350
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,367
Fucking weird.

351
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,284
Have you finished playing?

352
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,087
You can't feel a thing?

353
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,798
Have you gone mad?!

354
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,458
He's experimenting.

355
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,093
He can't feel a thing.

356
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:44,632
You'll burn him!

357
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:55,890
Lawyer.

358
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:57,766
Lawyer.

359
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,484
That's personal.
I'll read it later.

360
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:04,899
The "personal" file?

361
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,739
Trash.

362
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:15,621
She's not bad.

363
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,662
How about a "hooker" file?

364
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:26,628
Enjoy your meal.

365
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,296
Thank you.

366
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,594
Do you mind?

367
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,107
Sorry.

368
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,863
Shit, I keep forgetting.

369
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,708
Shit, sorry.

370
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,926
That feels good.

371
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,921
Driss, come here, please.

372
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,678
Can you hear me?

373
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,057
Come here, please.

374
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:28,398
What?

375
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,031
It's nearly nine. Philippe's waiting.

376
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:35,163
Nine already? This bath gel
takes ages to foam.

377
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,323
What a pigsty.

378
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,537
Can you make my coffee?

379
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:39,701
The baby monitor!

380
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,419
Always with you!

381
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,587
And Nutella!

382
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,375
Not that jam made with weird fruit!

383
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,317
I'm not getting in this.

384
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:11,742
And I'm not loading you
into the back like a horse.

385
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,996
What's this?

386
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:19,078
That one's less suitable.

387
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,540
Meaning?

388
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,751
Unfortunately,
we need to be pragmatic.

389
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:28,750
Pragmatic?

390
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,888
Holy fuck.

391
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,471
Listen to that.

392
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,343
- It feels so good.
- It's great.

393
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:39,762
This is good.

394
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:42,306
She's nervy.

395
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,019
Let's go!

396
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,615
The neighbor keeps parking there.

397
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,743
He thinks it's his space.

398
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,702
Not for much longer.

399
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:08,294
How's it going?

400
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:11,801
Am I bothering you, Blondie?
Want a coffee?

401
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,131
Come on.

402
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,392
- Go on, read this!
- "Keep free at all times."

403
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:20,552
Louder!

404
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:22,520
That's the way.

405
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,477
- Read it all.
- "Reserved parking."

406
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,809
Get that into your thick skull
and move!

407
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,895
Go on, Blondie, piss off!

408
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,829
We open Tuesday.
It'll be sold by then.

409
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,121
Can we go?

410
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:47,663
You've been there an hour.
Time to switch channels.

411
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:52,626
There's a lot of serenity in it.
A certain violence too.

412
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,010
It's very touching.

413
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,839
T ouching? Red splashes on white?

414
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,597
How much is it?

415
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,848
Thirty thousand euros, I think,
but I'll check.

416
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:03,553
Yeah, check.

417
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,140
That price seems way high to me.

418
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:12,317
You can't buy this crap!
It's not possible!

419
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:13,859
It is possible.

420
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:16,741
The guy wants 30 grand
for a nosebleed!

421
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,743
Tell me, Driss,

422
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,870
why are people interested in art?

423
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,658
- It's all business, I guess.
- No.

424
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:28,378
It's the trace
of our passage on this earth.

425
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,163
Bullshit.

426
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,209
For 50 euros,
I'll do you a trace of my passage.

427
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,842
I'll even add some blue!

428
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,595
Enough. Give me a chocolate.

429
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,052
No.

430
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:42,634
Give me a chocolate.

431
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:45,645
No handy, no candy.

432
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,479
It's a joke.

433
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,352
I'm kidding.

434
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,938
- It's a joke?
- Yes.

435
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,232
- A joke.
- It's a good one.

436
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,321
A very good joke.

437
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:01,911
That's the punch line, see.

438
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,822
But in your case...

439
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,115
Come on.

440
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:07,917
- It's wicked.
- It's a good joke.

441
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,996
You got no hands, Philippe.

442
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:15,000
I'll tell it to Marge Simpson.

443
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,511
I was wrong about the price.

444
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:24,847
It's 41,500 euros.

445
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:26,928
I'll take it.

446
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:28,846
You will?

447
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,234
Hi, Philippe.

448
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:41,943
How are you doing?

449
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:45,163
You summoned me, so here I am.

450
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,535
I'm listening.

451
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,500
What's so urgent?

452
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,961
I didn't summon you.

453
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:59,094
You must have some idea
why I'm here.

454
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,055
Who is this fellow?

455
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,342
Everyone's worried.

456
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,846
Yvonne tells me
he's reckless, violent...

457
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,264
He hit a neighbor?

458
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,939
I don't need to tell you
you have to be vigilant.

459
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,946
Don't let just anyone
into your home,

460
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,777
especially not in your state.

461
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:25,992
I'm not really sure
you know whom you're dealing with.

462
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,369
Carry on.

463
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,286
I called Sivot
at the Justice Ministry.

464
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,456
The boy isn't Al Capone,

465
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,750
but young Driss has a record.

466
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:41,010
He just did six months for robbery.

467
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,968
On top of the rest...

468
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:47,892
...I'm told he's useless.

469
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,223
Be careful.

470
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,604
These street guys have no pity.

471
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,023
That's it exactly.

472
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,482
That's what I want. No pity.

473
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,815
He often hands me the phone
because he forgets.

474
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,740
T rue, he isn't compassionate.

475
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,117
But he's strong, with arms and legs.

476
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,158
His brain works, he's healthy.

477
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:14,920
So, all the rest,
given my state, as you call it,

478
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,752
his background and so on,
I don't give a shit.

479
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,750
As you wish.

480
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,384
Will that be all?

481
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,093
Magalie...

482
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,766
- Got a minute?
- Not really.

483
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,057
I want to show you something.

484
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:36,933
What is it?

485
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,273
Chill, you can always say no.

486
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,654
One minute then.

487
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:48,945
So?

488
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,409
So I have a bathtub.

489
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:52,616
That's all.

490
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,077
Very interesting.

491
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,711
- And...
- We could take a bath.

492
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,459
There's plenty of room.

493
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,965
I have bath salts and foam.

494
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,386
Why not?

495
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,219
Yeah. Why not?

496
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,722
Go on then, get undressed.

497
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,889
Look at you!

498
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,104
The saucy kind. I like it.

499
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,565
OK, I'll get undressed.

500
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,449
What?

501
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,110
Where are you going?

502
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,574
You said yes!

503
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:32,951
Just a quick rinse!

504
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:38,286
What's with you?

505
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:41,423
I'm always tense
when the mail arrives.

506
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,838
As Apollinaire said:

507
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:50,883
"I despair as I yearn
for a letter from you..."

508
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,891
Slower, you're losing me.

509
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:56,145
I'm at "As Apollinaire said:"

510
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:58,602
"I despair as I yearn
for a letter..."

511
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:05,234
You may not realize,
but this is private.

512
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:07,657
No, I didn't realize.

513
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:08,907
Give me that.

514
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,864
Only if you explain.

515
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,030
There's nothing to explain.

516
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,164
He writes letters.

517
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:16,912
Letters?

518
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,041
Who to?

519
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,919
Usually to women.

520
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,169
Come on, who?

521
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,754
One in particular. Eléonore.

522
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:28,215
Who? We've never seen her.

523
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,845
How come?

524
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,722
It's an epistolary relationship.

525
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:39,640
Meaning they write to each other.
They correspond solely by mail.

526
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,433
No need to spell it out.

527
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,396
The blue envelopes?

528
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,067
He's hot stuff.

529
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,782
He epistoles.

530
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,738
How about you?

531
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,616
No lover in sight?

532
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,085
Albert the gardener, say?

533
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,496
Certainly not!

534
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:06,212
I've seen the longing looks
he gives you.

535
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,752
Am I wrong? Yes or no?

536
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,342
Stop it, it's ridiculous.

537
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:13,802
Has he slipped it to you?

538
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,717
- What?
- His little cucumber.

539
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,725
What?

540
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,815
I must be dreaming.

541
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,192
Albert, Albert.

542
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,646
He will soon.

543
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,000
Shit!

544
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:56,848
Are you OK?

545
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:03,682
Want some music?

546
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,835
It's all right.

547
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:31,338
Calm down.

548
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,982
Take it easy.

549
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,522
Try to breathe slowly.

550
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,319
You're with me.

551
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,365
Take it easy.

552
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,338
Try to breathe slowly.

553
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,219
It's all right.

554
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,411
I need air!

555
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,331
I need air!

556
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,360
Shit!

557
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,580
It's good to breathe.

558
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,076
What time is it?

559
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,165
I don't know. Around 4:00 a.m.

560
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,875
It's ages
since I saw Paris by night.

561
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:37,752
What happened?

562
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,545
The medication has its limits.

563
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,428
Doctors call them phantom pains.

564
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,769
I feel like a frozen steak
tossed onto a red-hot griddle.

565
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,189
I feel nothing but suffer anyway.

566
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,487
Surely something could help.

567
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,658
That could.

568
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:12,208
We're all sick for that,
me worse than you probably.

569
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:18,510
I wanted to ask you...
With women...

570
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,715
How do you manage?

571
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:23,848
You adapt.

572
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,350
So can you do it or not?

573
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,182
You may not realize,

574
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:31,894
but I feel nothing
from my neck to my toes.

575
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,191
So you can't.

576
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:38,362
It's not that simple.

577
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:41,366
I can, but it's not my decision.

578
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:43,697
And you can find pleasure elsewhere.

579
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:44,860
Yeah?

580
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,279
You've no idea.

581
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,540
You're right. How, for example?

582
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,784
For example, the ears.

583
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:54,875
The ears?

584
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:59,383
The ears are a highly sensitive
erogenous zone.

585
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:01,510
You get your ears licked?

586
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,590
I'd never have guessed.

587
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,427
Philippe?

588
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,945
- Try this. It'll help.
- What is this crap?

589
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,039
It can't hurt you.

590
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:32,499
Drag on it.

591
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,876
Go on, drag on it.

592
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,334
Take it easy. Share it.

593
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,583
Again.

594
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,383
One more time.

595
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:46,923
That's enough for now.

596
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,807
Sorry, but you really get off
with your ears?

597
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:55,940
If your ears are red,
that means you're turned on?

598
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,566
Exactly.

599
00:44:57,737 --> 00:45:00,570
Sometimes they're hard when I wake.

600
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,445
- Both of them?
- Yes!

601
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:11,240
I met my wife Alice
when we were students.

602
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,371
She was tall, very elegant,

603
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,830
with laughing eyes.

604
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:19,247
Is she the blond in the photos?

605
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:20,877
She's not bad.

606
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,384
What we had was incredible.

607
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,966
I hope you experience that one day.

608
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,887
Fuck, I loved her so much!
I loved her so much.

609
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,440
Then she got pregnant.

610
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:45,357
Five successive miscarriages.

611
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:52,622
Then the verdict came in.
An incurable, terminal illness.

612
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,621
We decided to adopt.

613
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:10,756
Waiter!

614
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:12,637
Excuse me!

615
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,766
Excuse me!

616
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,184
Yes?

617
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:26,355
A tarte tatin, please.

618
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:31,323
Cooked.
The chocolate cake was raw.

619
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:35,536
It was all squashy and gooey.
Weird.

620
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,747
That's what molten cake is.

621
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,661
- So that's why.
- Yes.

622
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,751
I'll have a tarte tatin anyway.

623
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,257
I've always loved competition,

624
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:47,544
extreme sports, speed.

625
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,758
Going faster, higher.

626
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,223
A paraglider gave me that.

627
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:56,807
I was high in the sky,
looking down at things, breathing.

628
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:59,814
I was raised to think
we pissed on the world.

629
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,934
Some water. My mouth's dry.

630
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,902
The joint does that.

631
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:12,201
And what else?

632
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,360
Makes you hungry

633
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,655
and chatty.

634
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,708
But bad weather can be fatal
when paragliding.

635
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:26,590
And you flew anyway?

636
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:30,720
Yes, maybe to suffer like Alice.
I knew she'd never recover.

637
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:36,722
I broke the third and fourth vertebrae.
Now only fly in my mind.

638
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:40,559
When the pain eases,
I have my thoughts.

639
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,726
My real handicap
isn't being in a chair.

640
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,652
It's living without her.

641
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:56,029
What do the doctors say?

642
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:59,791
With the advances in medicine,
they'll keep me going to 70

643
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,622
with massages and pick-me-ups.

644
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:05,755
It's expensive,
but I'm a rich invalid.

645
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:10,759
I'd have shot myself.

646
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:13,672
That's not easy in my condition.

647
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,761
True.

648
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,137
That sucks.

649
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,020
What's the date today?

650
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:23,601
The eighth or the ninth.

651
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:25,186
It's official then.

652
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,730
What is?

653
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,269
You've won your bet.

654
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,779
Your trial period's over.

655
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:31,860
I'm hired then?

656
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,774
Yes, you're hired.

657
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:35,943
Can I count on you now?

658
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:37,987
- Yes.
- Good.

659
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,781
Start by giving my Fabergé egg back.

660
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,252
Alice gave me one each year.

661
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:48,210
I have 25, one for each year
we were together.

662
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:50,299
I cherish it.

663
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:54,804
I don't know why you...
Wasn't me.

664
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:57,806
What did you lose again?

665
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,271
Mina!

666
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,480
Mina!

667
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,827
- What's up?
- Get in.

668
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:21,909
Buckle up.

669
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:34,710
How's it going?

670
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:42,305
How's school?

671
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:46,518
Why don't you text me back?

672
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:49,767
I was busy.

673
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:55,273
Let's hear it.
Who called?

674
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:58,614
A cop, to talk to Mom.
I put on a deep voice

675
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,323
and said we'd go.

676
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,157
Found my egg?

677
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,412
Have you found it?

678
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,627
Screw your stone egg.
I haven't found it.

679
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,475
What did you say?

680
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,386
What could I say?

681
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,896
I only had 30 grams on me.

682
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:31,309
For that you get a spell in custody,
then it's bye-bye.

683
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:33,023
Let's get a kebab.

684
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:35,609
I'm not getting in that!

685
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:36,772
Let go of me.

686
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:37,861
Where are you going?

687
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,526
Who's driving you?

688
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:41,784
Get lost!

689
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,492
It's not your business.

690
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,118
Piss off!

691
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,886
Fuck!

692
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:02,970
"Her shining eyes
are made of charming minerals

693
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,930
and in this strange,
symbolic world..."

694
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,479
"And in this strange...

695
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,565
...symbolic...

696
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,729
...world..."

697
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,603
Fucking boring!

698
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:20,737
"...where the inviolate angel
and ancient sphinx..."

699
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:23,452
Is that with an "i" or a "y"?

700
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:25,954
This is killing my mind.

701
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,162
"Sphinx" is with an "i."

702
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,327
Why bother with this crap?

703
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:34,247
Sphinxes, daisies, angels...

704
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:36,711
You'd go for this stuff?

705
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:39,843
True, one could be more direct.

706
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:44,306
"And ancient sphinx..." Go on.

707
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,137
What's she look like?

708
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:48,928
I don't know.
That's not what matters.

709
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:53,441
It's intellectual and emotional,
not physical.

710
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:55,442
I want a mind-to-mind relationship.

711
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:59,401
If she's a troll,
it'll be mind-to-troll!

712
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,741
Very subtle. Really.

713
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,527
What can I say?

714
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:07,242
Bravo.

715
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,327
How long's it been going on?

716
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:16,914
Please.

717
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:19,671
Six months.

718
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,301
Six months?

719
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,713
And you've never seen her?

720
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:27,304
Maybe she's fat and ugly.
Or handicapped.

721
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:30,811
At the end of the poem
put "How's your weight?"

722
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:35,562
Thank you very much
for your sound advice, Driss.

723
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,435
Let's carry on. Where was I?

724
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:42,736
A sphinx was eating daisies
with an angel,

725
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,821
then running and doing stuff.

726
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:46,948
Let me see...

727
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:49,909
"In this strange,
symbolic world..."

728
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:54,085
"In this strange,
symbolic world..."

729
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,243
Call her!

730
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:59,878
"...where the inviolate angel
and ancient sphinx..."

731
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,333
Call her, OK!

732
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:05,713
I can get more across
with the written word, OK?

733
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:07,677
He's incredible.

734
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,560
I'm going to find her number.
This is stressing me out.

735
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,686
Dunkirk. That's bad.

736
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:18,271
Put that down.

737
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,060
No beauty queens there.

738
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,149
Only trolls.

739
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:23,939
Put that down right now.

740
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:25,528
Her number's here.

741
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:27,910
That means she wants you to call!

742
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,945
Put it down, please!

743
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:31,989
She wrote her number here.

744
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:35,000
That means:
"Call me, I'll lick your ear."

745
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,828
What's he doing?
Don't call her.

746
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,372
Enough poetry after six months.

747
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,499
He's totally crazy!

748
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:44,422
I won't speak to her.

749
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:47,429
I bet she has an accent.
They talk weird up there.

750
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:48,964
Hang up!

751
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,679
"I want my Philippe."

752
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:52,218
She's gonna get him.

753
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:55,099
The voice sounds OK.

754
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:03,153
Improvise, talk about the daisies...

755
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:05,773
Eléonore? It's Philippe.

756
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:11,487
I'm calling because I really wanted
to hear the sound of your voice

757
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,998
and with that first "hello,"

758
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:17,626
- I'm fulfilled.
- I'll put her on.

759
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:22,123
T oo wordy.
Try simpler sentences.

760
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:25,008
Eléonore, it's Philippe.

761
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,086
Philippe?

762
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,346
I was writing you a letter and...

763
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:34,055
...it just hit me,
"Why don't I call her?"

764
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:36,061
Ask her weight!

765
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,477
- I'm sorry?
- No, nothing.

766
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,017
"I'm in mourning,

767
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:43,151
I weep, I'm afraid.

768
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:44,982
Lord, fresh air..."

769
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:47,523
Yes, "The Foolish Virgin."
You're unbeatable.

770
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,032
I love Rimbaud too.

771
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:51,114
Sorry, I was here first.

772
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,654
Eléonore, I'm so happy.

773
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:56,619
What a chatterbox!

774
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,910
There's no stopping you now.

775
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:00,418
T ake care.

776
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:03,706
Let's all take care,
let's all lick our ears.

777
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:04,964
Excellent.

778
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,625
Well?

779
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:10,170
Good news and not so good news.

780
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:11,755
The good news?

781
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:13,049
Fifty-three kilos.

782
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:15,058
Fifty-three kilos, that's good.

783
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:16,560
Unless she's one meter tall.

784
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:21,436
The bad news is, she wants a photo.

785
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,101
- So?
- Very funny.

786
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,520
Your tickets, please.

787
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:27,608
Good evening.

788
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:28,772
Right here.

789
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:30,566
- OK.
- Have a good evening.

790
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:33,235
If you want us,
we won't move from there.

791
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,949
Especially him.

792
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:40,330
What do you think women want?

793
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:41,744
I don't know.

794
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:44,497
Beauty, charm, elegance...

795
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:48,376
Bullshit!
They want dough and security.

796
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,378
Just ask him.

797
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,965
And you have what it takes.

798
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:57,180
I'm naïve.

799
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,972
I hope to charm with more
than just my bank account.

800
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:06,269
After six months reading
your lame poems, she's hot for you.

801
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:10,109
She's an original all right.
The chair won't bother her.

802
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:12,400
That's true.

803
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:15,614
Up north,
guys drink and beat women.

804
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:17,404
She'll be safe with you.

805
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:18,993
Bastard.

806
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:22,117
Pragmatic, right?

807
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,287
I don't know.

808
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:29,254
If she sends her photo,
it means she wants to go further.

809
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:33,512
Send a photo of you
without the chair really showing.

810
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:36,173
It doesn't have to be
a telethon one

811
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,387
with you drooling

812
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:41,053
and looking like shit.

813
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,062
OK, I get the message.

814
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,946
This guy's not well.
He's not at all well.

815
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,077
What?

816
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:06,211
He's a tree?

817
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:08,289
A singing tree.

818
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:16,971
That's German!

819
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:19,299
What?

820
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:21,685
It's in German.

821
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,061
In German.

822
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:25,768
You're a nutcase.

823
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:27,892
What a drag.

824
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,685
- How long does it last?
- Four hours.

825
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:30,943
Fuck!

826
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:36,984
Good-looking back then.

827
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:39,861
Which one?

828
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,790
This one.

829
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:50,088
Or maybe this one.

830
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:55,256
Sure, there's a problem,
but you look good.

831
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:57,596
Wanna try it?

832
00:57:57,766 --> 00:57:58,801
I don't know.

833
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:02,226
- Wasn't it a blast talking to her?
- Yes, it was.

834
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:03,385
That's all?

835
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:05,679
- A fucking blast.
- So?

836
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:09,148
Put the damn photo in an envelope!

837
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:12,607
There.
The very words I wanted to hear.

838
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,359
Gimme a cig.

839
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:20,535
Don't you ever knock?

840
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,320
You're painting?

841
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,952
- Get out.
- Seriously? You're painting?

842
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:26,663
Learned to read too?

843
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:29,123
What do you want?
Get lost!

844
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:31,083
Going to hit a woman?

845
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:32,623
You do that in your country?

846
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:34,541
You're whacked! Get out.

847
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,335
- Get out now!
- I'll go when I want.

848
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,969
Get the hell out!

849
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,176
- I've decided to go now.
- Get out!

850
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:41,889
Shit.

851
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,392
Replace that photo with the other.

852
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:49,940
Make sure to post it yourself.
And be discreet.

853
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:51,980
As you wish.

854
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:55,270
Put the other photo in the trash.

855
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:56,817
I'm blowing a fuse!

856
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:59,324
HOOKERS

857
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:04,538
- What's wrong?
- Your daughter!

858
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,364
I was painting.

859
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:08,742
You were painting?

860
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,410
I'm telling you,

861
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,212
set her straight
or I'll demolish her!

862
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,840
- Calm down.
- No, I won't calm down!

863
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,050
I'm your arms and legs here?

864
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:21,305
- That's right.
- I want to be your hands

865
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:25,093
to give her a slap
'cause all you can do is run her down!

866
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:28,433
Aren't you overdoing it?
Yvonne?

867
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:37,070
She could do
with being set straight a bit.

868
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,275
A bit?

869
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,361
At 1 6, she dresses like a tramp!

870
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:43,151
She keeps making out
with mop-head.

871
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:45,112
But that's not my problem.

872
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:49,329
What bothers me
are her high and mighty airs,

873
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:51,414
the way she talks to you and me.

874
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,455
No respect.
She treats us like dogs.

875
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,129
Say the word and I'll set her straight.

876
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,463
I get the message.

877
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:01,469
Let me talk to her.

878
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:06,474
So talk to her, and fast.

879
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:09,686
Do something.
Set her straight.

880
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:12,480
He paints? What does he paint?

881
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:14,391
No idea.

882
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:36,584
Wake up.

883
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:38,498
Rise and shine.

884
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:45,510
Here we go.
Power-hose time.

885
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,018
Respect the people
I need around me.

886
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:33,645
It's intolerable.

887
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,146
Is that clear?

888
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:37,023
Be tougher on her!

889
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,560
I don't want that mop-head around.

890
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:42,150
- Give me a break.
- I'm not through!

891
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:45,157
I have to run you down
to get you to obey?

892
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:47,568
There, he's done it!

893
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,198
You painted this?

894
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:54,365
Yeah.

895
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:56,492
I love it.

896
01:01:57,172 --> 01:02:00,756
I'm not saying
I'd necessarily hang it

897
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,291
in my place, but...

898
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:05,343
What can we get for it?

899
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:08,881
We'll see.

900
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:11,474
See more or see less?

901
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:13,852
It's...

902
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,387
Are you nuts?

903
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,397
C'mon! No tongues, OK.

904
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:19,683
You're sick in the head!

905
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:22,777
I don't believe this.

906
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,479
Speed it up a bit.

907
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:25,864
I'm flat-out.

908
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:29,491
You're way too slow!

909
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,869
Twelve kilometers an hour is cool?

910
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,120
That's cool.

911
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:34,410
Twelve kilometers an hour is cool,
right?

912
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:36,871
No faster?

913
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:38,626
- That's the top speed.
- OK.

914
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:14,287
Stick to the ears.

915
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,600
Yes, Yvonne.

916
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:39,057
No, he can't hear.
He's nowhere near me.

917
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,514
He can't hear me, Yvonne.

918
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,940
We'll be there at 8:30 sharp.

919
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:47,149
We'll push it back.

920
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:48,985
Goodbye, Yvonne.

921
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:51,074
She's stressed out?

922
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:54,736
Yes, your birthday surprise
will be half an hour later.

923
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:58,452
She gets into a terrible state
every year.

924
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:01,914
She invites my whole family.
It all goes like clockwork.

925
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:06,506
They come to see
if I'm still alive.

926
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:08,466
The annual check-up.

927
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:13,087
I pretend to be surprised.

928
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:15,386
We all make an effort,

929
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,721
but, to be honest,
we all get bored shitless.

930
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:58,424
Excuse me...

931
01:04:59,187 --> 01:05:00,472
Excuse me...

932
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,605
Do you mind moving along?

933
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:10,228
Yes, I do mind.

934
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:11,362
All right.

935
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:13,569
Thank you. Move along.

936
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:16,784
Move just one seat along.

937
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:19,491
Very kind.

938
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:32,800
A suit changes a man.

939
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:35,462
You look good.

940
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:39,057
You look like Obama.

941
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:41,843
Yeah?

942
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:46,685
She's hot for me, I can tell.

943
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,225
Barack Obama.

944
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:49,518
Classy.

945
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:55,649
That's like comparing you...

946
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:57,821
...to George Bush...

947
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:00,112
...or Nixon.

948
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:12,249
What's up? You'll miss the concert.

949
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:13,633
Leave me alone!

950
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:16,043
Got your period?

951
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:17,594
Piss off!

952
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:18,800
What's wrong?

953
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:20,928
Elisa...

954
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,887
- Leave me be!
- What did you take?

955
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:27,851
What did you do?

956
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:31,934
Where's this from?

957
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:33,732
Yvonne's purse.

958
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:34,896
Imodium?

959
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:37,364
What was this for?

960
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:38,945
To kill yourself?

961
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:41,365
You won't shit for months now!

962
01:06:41,873 --> 01:06:42,862
Leave me alone.

963
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:44,246
Hold on...

964
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:47,663
You took Tylenol too?
You're dying.

965
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:48,910
This is bad!

966
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:52,838
Shall I call an ambulance?

967
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:54,540
Why did you do it?

968
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:57,043
Because of Bastien.

969
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:58,757
What about him?

970
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:01,264
He dumped me,
he doesn't give a shit.

971
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,299
He even called me a slut.

972
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:04,850
That's bad.

973
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:07,432
It'd suit everyone if I died.

974
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:09,768
Stop talking crap. Come downstairs.

975
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:12,650
Go to see him for me.
Talk to him.

976
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:13,730
Who?

977
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:15,816
Bastien. I'll pay you.

978
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,231
Pay me? Are you out of your mind?

979
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,525
Spare me this childish shit.

980
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,783
Please!

981
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:24,446
I talk to Bastien
and you pay me.

982
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:26,906
Who do you think I am?

983
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:30,452
Driss, please!

984
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:32,749
How much?

985
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:35,916
Jerk.

986
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:41,929
It has style.
There's a certain touch.

987
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:45,304
But 11,000 for an unknown artist...

988
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:54,309
But if I say no
and the value triples, I'll regret it

989
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,398
and you'll say, "I told you so."

990
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:01,574
He has a show in London?

991
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,029
And Berlin soon.

992
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:05,031
Berlin too.

993
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:09,957
I don't know.

994
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:13,544
Eleven thousand euros
is quite a sum.

995
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,665
Come on, fill me in here.

996
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:18,253
Is she with someone?

997
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:21,260
All right. Yes. Fred.

998
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:22,420
Fred?

999
01:08:23,558 --> 01:08:25,014
They've been together two years...

1000
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:27,975
...but with ups and downs.

1001
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:29,973
Things are often tense.

1002
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:32,980
They're pretty rocky now.

1003
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:35,483
Maybe because of me?

1004
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:37,985
- Has she mentioned me?
- No.

1005
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:41,444
Of course. A little.

1006
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:43,904
Fuck! She's hot for me.

1007
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:48,367
You're bullshitting me?

1008
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:50,622
- No.
- Bullshit away!

1009
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,658
I'll bed Magalie one day.

1010
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,585
Hope keeps us going.

1011
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:58,381
Easy on those
if you have stomach trouble.

1012
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:00,709
I'm no doctor,

1013
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:03,299
but Imodium means there's a problem.

1014
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:14,896
Excuse me.

1015
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:17,855
Can I ask a favor of you?

1016
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:20,312
One more piece just for me?

1017
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:22,860
No, we were cool.

1018
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:26,443
Vivaldi's Four Seasons:

1019
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,365
"L'Estate."

1020
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:29,654
You'll like this.

1021
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:31,198
Shit.

1022
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:50,008
Come on,
don't tell me you feel nothing.

1023
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:53,849
Not a thing.
It doesn't do a thing for me.

1024
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:56,105
Music's something you dance to.

1025
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:58,562
Let's try something else.

1026
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,441
I know that one.

1027
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,068
That's an ad.

1028
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:10,111
For coffee.

1029
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:17,956
Oyez, by mandate,

1030
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:20,793
I'm expected at the chateau...

1031
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:24,125
...to bring the minstrels there.

1032
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:26,878
I'm a good knight.

1033
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:30,464
That one's fishy.

1034
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:33,180
I see people without clothes.

1035
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:37,981
They're running.
I see them running naked.

1036
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:39,265
And giggling.

1037
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,059
All right.

1038
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:43,273
Bach was hot.

1039
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:47,699
Women went for him.
The Barry White of his day.

1040
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,782
I know this one!

1041
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:54,038
I know it. Everyone knows it.

1042
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:55,532
Sure!

1043
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:58,659
"This is the Paris Benefit Office.

1044
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,121
All our lines are currently busy.

1045
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,296
Waiting time: two years."

1046
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,091
"T om and Jerry," right?

1047
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:21,807
"T om and Jerry."

1048
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:24,818
What a jerk.

1049
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:27,154
Someone help me.
A masterpiece.

1050
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:30,612
OK, after your classics,

1051
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:32,152
Iet's listen to mine.

1052
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:34,119
Earth, Wind & Fire.

1053
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,279
It's a killer.

1054
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:40,243
Something else, huh?

1055
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:42,753
Definitely something else.

1056
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:46,166
Call my name, I won't answer.

1057
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:49,757
- Driss!
- I'm not answering.

1058
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:51,170
Here we go.

1059
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:25,747
It's a birthday party!

1060
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:27,415
Let's dance!
Come on, move!

1061
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:29,291
It's his birthday!

1062
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:31,794
Yeah, Yvonne.

1063
01:12:31,973 --> 01:12:33,053
Ace, Albert.

1064
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:46,233
Spin! Spin!

1065
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:23,805
All right.

1066
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:26,270
Time for my little gift.

1067
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:29,568
I didn't want to spoil things

1068
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:32,321
if she turned out to be ugly.
You never know.

1069
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:34,277
She answered anyhow.

1070
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:36,150
Good night.

1071
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:40,829
I'll open it. You'll take ages.

1072
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:44,992
Well?

1073
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:48,954
- She's not a troll.
- Really?

1074
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:51,378
Shit.

1075
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:54,051
The only one in Dunkirk
with all her teeth!

1076
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:56,174
There's a note too.

1077
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:58,931
"I'll be in Paris next week.

1078
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:01,387
I'll be expecting your call."
And three dots!

1079
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:04,687
Meaning what?

1080
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:07,598
- Any idea?
- It's a good sign?

1081
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:09,642
You bet. She wants nooky.

1082
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:12,527
Three dots. One, two and three dots.

1083
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:13,938
"She wants nooky."

1084
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,072
I'm getting nooky.

1085
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:18,735
It's looking good.

1086
01:14:18,913 --> 01:14:20,198
How can I sleep now?

1087
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:22,284
You'll manage.

1088
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,039
I'll put her here.

1089
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:26,409
She'll watch you sleep.

1090
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:29,666
Good night, Philippe.

1091
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:32,044
Sweet dreams.

1092
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:45,803
Try the cap again.

1093
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:49,769
Not bad.

1094
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:52,777
No way!
He looks like a farmer.

1095
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:55,359
- Go for traditional.
- That's what I said.

1096
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:58,115
- How's this?
- No good. Too traditional.

1097
01:14:58,285 --> 01:15:01,368
Forget the caps and hats,
find something.

1098
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:04,322
Traditional or trendy?

1099
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:06,248
That's it.

1100
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:07,659
This works.

1101
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:09,543
The angler look?

1102
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:11,629
We're off to Dunkirk.

1103
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:15,633
I'll go with Yvonne. We'll be fine.

1104
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:16,792
You sure?

1105
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:21,384
Yes, I'll manage.

1106
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:22,639
Fine.

1107
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:28,474
I'm a bit stressed out.

1108
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:31,398
It doesn't show. You look great.

1109
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:36,237
4ac minus b2.

1110
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:37,613
- Minus b2?
- Yeah.

1111
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:39,273
I got 20 instead.

1112
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:40,532
Come here, you.

1113
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:43,493
Take a hike, Justin Bieber.

1114
01:15:44,123 --> 01:15:45,659
Recognize me, Bastien?

1115
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:47,323
Yeah. What's up?

1116
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:49,492
You said a bad thing to Elisa.

1117
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,160
- I said nothing.
- Shut up!

1118
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:53,830
Act like a man and apologize.

1119
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:55,123
OK, I'm sorry.

1120
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:56,290
Hands off.

1121
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:58,460
- Not to me, to her.
- Right.

1122
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:01,003
Bring her croissants each day.

1123
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:02,843
- Plain or chocolate?
- What?

1124
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:04,257
Plain or chocolate?

1125
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:05,550
Whatever.

1126
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:07,309
Just do it right.

1127
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,016
You're nice to her.

1128
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:10,305
Now piss off.

1129
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:11,848
Go on, get lost.

1130
01:16:12,026 --> 01:16:13,857
And try using a barrette!

1131
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:19,150
What time is it?

1132
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:22,358
It's 4:45.

1133
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:31,413
Let's take the cap off.

1134
01:16:33,214 --> 01:16:34,203
Good idea.

1135
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:44,388
Now what time is it?

1136
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:48,176
Forty-six or 47.
Time doesn't move very fast.

1137
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,686
I'd like a whisky.

1138
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:32,387
Another.

1139
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:34,101
Is that a good idea?

1140
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:35,602
A double!

1141
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:40,861
Waiter, a double whisky, please.

1142
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:13,226
Driss?

1143
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:15,262
Am I disturbing you?

1144
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:17,432
I'm at the gym. Well?

1145
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:20,063
Do you feel like getting away?

1146
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:22,311
No questions asked?

1147
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:23,569
No questions, no.

1148
01:18:23,741 --> 01:18:26,403
- You want to split?
- Exactly.

1149
01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:28,400
And go where?

1150
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:31,237
T o breathe a little.

1151
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:33,371
Breathe a little?

1152
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:36,750
I'll shower and be right there.

1153
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:41,293
We're leaving. The cap...

1154
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:42,919
It's only just six...

1155
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:44,128
We're leaving!

1156
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:23,001
Good evening.

1157
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:32,966
Give him some champagne
to help him relax.

1158
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:34,640
I'm not tense.

1159
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:36,018
- You're not?
- No.

1160
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:55,404
It's just us?

1161
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:58,290
No other people on board?

1162
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,666
Just us?

1163
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:21,472
I don't like this.

1164
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:22,639
Why not?

1165
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:24,774
I don't know.

1166
01:20:26,447 --> 01:20:28,563
Because you seem kind of jinxed.

1167
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:31,524
The accident, the wheelchair,

1168
01:20:31,702 --> 01:20:32,691
your wife...

1169
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:35,278
Sounds like the Kennedys.

1170
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:38,573
Miss?

1171
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:41,910
Could we have the package please?

1172
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:43,076
Thank you.

1173
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:48,915
Thank you.

1174
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:51,214
Why?

1175
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:00,844
What the hell?

1176
01:21:01,023 --> 01:21:04,891
Your value on the art market.
I managed to get 1 1,000 euros.

1177
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:08,611
Keep at it. You have talent.

1178
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:11,363
That's a great deal.
I sensed something.

1179
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:14,149
It all came about instinctively.

1180
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:18,196
With the music playing,
it made for a really good blend.

1181
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:22,204
It was a sort of revelation,
like I saw the light.

1182
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:23,534
Don't get carried away.

1183
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:26,374
Eleven thousand
for my first painting!

1184
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:28,418
What was that?

1185
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:31,508
Just a hole in the fuselage.

1186
01:21:31,678 --> 01:21:32,918
We won't make it.

1187
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:35,088
T ell me what's up!

1188
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:39,012
- Glad to have known you.
- Not funny.

1189
01:21:39,186 --> 01:21:43,395
I know you're used to tragedy,
but I'm not.

1190
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:17,638
You gotta be nuts to do that.

1191
01:22:17,808 --> 01:22:18,843
A little.

1192
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:26,521
I have to say something.

1193
01:22:27,151 --> 01:22:29,358
You're a total headcase.

1194
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:30,901
Really?

1195
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:35,113
Now get Driss ready.

1196
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:39,702
Sure. No way I'm doing that.

1197
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:42,450
I'll be over there taking photos.

1198
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:43,989
"Get Driss ready!"

1199
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:46,329
How will you take photos?

1200
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:48,831
Laugh. I'm not doing it.

1201
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,306
Holy shit.

1202
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:03,759
I'm not going.

1203
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:05,768
- Hold on.
- How do I get this off?

1204
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:08,681
I don't have to do it.

1205
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:18,573
I'm not doing this!

1206
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:20,905
I lost my fucking shoe!

1207
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:22,569
My shoe's down there.

1208
01:23:23,916 --> 01:23:27,454
Motherfucker!
We're heading up!

1209
01:23:38,889 --> 01:23:39,969
What the fuck!

1210
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,381
- What's going on?
- Hey, Driss.

1211
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,426
Relax, pal.

1212
01:23:47,147 --> 01:23:49,854
I'm relaxed,
but I want to be down there.

1213
01:23:54,404 --> 01:23:56,395
Fucking hell!

1214
01:24:01,078 --> 01:24:03,694
I'm having a blast!

1215
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:40,314
Where do you find an invalid?

1216
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:43,405
- I don't know.
- Where you leave him.

1217
01:24:44,997 --> 01:24:46,203
That's a good one.

1218
01:24:47,874 --> 01:24:48,909
Bastard.

1219
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:53,414
Someone for you, Driss.

1220
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:58,297
What are you doing here?

1221
01:24:58,468 --> 01:25:01,084
I should ask you that.
You kept this quiet.

1222
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:02,503
How did you know?

1223
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:05,214
Benefit sent this, with the address.

1224
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:07,299
What's that?

1225
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:08,846
Forget it.

1226
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:10,977
- What happened?
- I fell off a scooter.

1227
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:12,638
You fell off a scooter?

1228
01:25:13,025 --> 01:25:15,061
Get up.

1229
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:16,979
You fell... Come here.

1230
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:22,446
Shit!

1231
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:27,490
You sleep here?

1232
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:30,864
- So what happened?
- Nothing.

1233
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:32,283
Come on, tell me.

1234
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:34,042
Not your problem.

1235
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:36,498
You're here, it's my problem!

1236
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:39,380
We got screwed.
The shit's gonna hit the fan.

1237
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:40,711
No fucking way!

1238
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:42,001
Does the old lady know?

1239
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:43,715
No, I'm handling it.

1240
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:46,221
You're handling fuck all!
Quit busting my balls!

1241
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:48,757
Don't touch anything. Wait here!

1242
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:50,471
Can I lie down?

1243
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:52,477
Don't touch a thing!

1244
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:54,229
OK, I get it!

1245
01:25:54,775 --> 01:25:55,981
Watch it, OK!

1246
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:01,815
No, he's with me.

1247
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:04,030
Quit crying, Mina.

1248
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:06,320
It's just a scratch.

1249
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:08,076
No, he's fine.

1250
01:26:08,246 --> 01:26:10,407
Calm down, no one's killing no one.

1251
01:26:10,624 --> 01:26:13,036
That's all just empty threats.

1252
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:16,581
I can't take care of him.
I gotta work.

1253
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:19,667
No, you don't tell her about it.

1254
01:26:19,883 --> 01:26:22,670
Stay in your room
if you want to cry.

1255
01:26:31,228 --> 01:26:32,593
Time for bed?

1256
01:26:33,105 --> 01:26:35,141
I'll stay up a while longer.

1257
01:26:36,233 --> 01:26:37,439
Sit down.

1258
01:26:39,486 --> 01:26:40,726
Sit down here.

1259
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:50,868
What do you think of her?

1260
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:55,950
- She looks hot.
- OK. And what else?

1261
01:26:57,337 --> 01:26:59,874
Let's go up.
I need to do something.

1262
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:02,084
I imagine her standing up,

1263
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:06,093
turning around
and I discover her face at last.

1264
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:12,928
The boy looks like you.
Adama, is that right?

1265
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:14,092
That's right.

1266
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:16,428
I spotted him earlier.

1267
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:18,688
If I passed him on the street,

1268
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:20,941
I'd know he was your brother.

1269
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:22,980
That's funny.

1270
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:25,061
Why?

1271
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,821
He's not my brother.

1272
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:29,532
He isn't?

1273
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:31,743
It's complicated.

1274
01:27:33,206 --> 01:27:35,413
Is he your brother or not?

1275
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:43,038
OK, I get the message.

1276
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:45,298
Come on, let's go.

1277
01:27:52,893 --> 01:27:54,258
My parents...

1278
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:57,469
...aren't my parents.

1279
01:27:58,482 --> 01:28:00,097
They're my uncle and aunt.

1280
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:03,563
They fetched me from Senegal
when I was eight.

1281
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:08,155
They couldn't have kids
but a brother had loads.

1282
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:10,156
They picked the oldest.

1283
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:12,283
Me.

1284
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:17,155
My name's Bakary.

1285
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:19,666
That's my real name.

1286
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:23,036
But other kids had that name
so they called me Idriss

1287
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:25,080
and that became Driss.

1288
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:28,046
And afterwards?

1289
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:31,462
Out of the blue,
my mother... my aunt

1290
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:34,052
got pregnant once
and then twice.

1291
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:36,053
Then my uncle died.

1292
01:28:36,228 --> 01:28:37,934
Other men, other kids.

1293
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:40,182
Like I said, complicated.

1294
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:45,184
Young Adama...
doesn't he need setting straight?

1295
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:56,237
He came to get you, right?

1296
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:01,241
Driss...

1297
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:06,587
I think we'll call it quits.

1298
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:10,717
You can't be pushing an invalid
for the rest of your life.

1299
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:15,213
After all your hard work,
you've earned your benefit.

1300
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:23,229
Come on, let's go.

1301
01:29:25,402 --> 01:29:26,391
Right.

1302
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:31,647
Bassari Bakary,

1303
01:29:31,825 --> 01:29:33,110
Bakary Bassari.

1304
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:36,118
It's beautiful.
It sounds like poetry.

1305
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:40,159
Almost like alliteration.
You know what alliteration is?

1306
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:41,322
No.

1307
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:47,709
Hello, Bastien.
See you tomorrow.

1308
01:29:47,883 --> 01:29:50,670
We'll need a few more for brunch.

1309
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:53,426
OK. Goodbye, Yvonne.

1310
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:55,508
- You got my sugar puffs?
- Yes.

1311
01:29:55,682 --> 01:29:57,092
Thank you.

1312
01:29:57,267 --> 01:29:59,258
- Say hi to Elisa.
- See you tomorrow.

1313
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:01,301
Hey, Bastien, pal, what's up?

1314
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:02,468
Come here!

1315
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:11,235
You're leaving then?

1316
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:15,778
It's OK, I have your number.
We'll stay in touch.

1317
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:18,777
It won't be easy, but be strong.

1318
01:30:19,915 --> 01:30:22,827
T oo bad, I'm getting your room.
Water damage in mine.

1319
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:25,705
Maybe I'll stay then.

1320
01:30:25,879 --> 01:30:27,744
We'll have to squeeze up.

1321
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:32,173
It'll be a bit cramped.
I don't live alone.

1322
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:34,088
Here.

1323
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:36,381
Meet Frédérique.

1324
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:40,840
Hey.

1325
01:30:45,357 --> 01:30:46,312
All right.

1326
01:30:46,483 --> 01:30:47,598
What?

1327
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:48,936
I get it.

1328
01:30:49,778 --> 01:30:51,439
So that's it. You're...

1329
01:30:51,988 --> 01:30:53,068
Yes.

1330
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:58,817
I won't kiss you goodbye then.

1331
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:05,995
I'm not against a threesome.

1332
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:13,207
I'm up for it.
Not now, since I have to go.

1333
01:31:13,385 --> 01:31:15,751
But I can come back tonight.

1334
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:17,836
I have to go now.

1335
01:31:18,014 --> 01:31:19,379
I'm kidding.

1336
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:26,060
Bye, guys.

1337
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:31,187
Mr. Michel Sabourdi.

1338
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:39,324
Keep it on, channel two.

1339
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:42,494
You're not angry about Magalie?

1340
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:45,371
No, you had me fooled.

1341
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:48,534
I couldn't figure out
why she kept resisting.

1342
01:31:53,633 --> 01:31:54,793
A goodbye kiss?

1343
01:31:57,095 --> 01:31:58,255
All right.

1344
01:32:01,391 --> 01:32:02,380
Yvonne.

1345
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:06,392
Always bullshitting me.

1346
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:08,474
See you.

1347
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:13,392
Just a second.

1348
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:21,403
We won't be needing this.

1349
01:32:23,997 --> 01:32:25,157
OK, bye.

1350
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:30,662
Get your foot off there.

1351
01:32:30,837 --> 01:32:31,826
Come on.

1352
01:32:51,024 --> 01:32:52,389
Which bank?

1353
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:59,317
Could you move your car, please?
You're not allowed to park here.

1354
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:00,480
There's a sign.

1355
01:33:00,784 --> 01:33:01,899
I'll move it.

1356
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,240
I'll call you back.

1357
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:08,321
Stop busting his balls.

1358
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:09,785
We're not driving.

1359
01:33:09,959 --> 01:33:11,369
Matter of principle.

1360
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:17,247
Wait over there for me.

1361
01:33:29,562 --> 01:33:30,972
What's going on?

1362
01:33:31,898 --> 01:33:32,887
I'm coming.

1363
01:35:11,289 --> 01:35:13,280
I can cancel my date if you want.

1364
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:15,449
No, certainly not. Why?

1365
01:35:15,627 --> 01:35:18,243
Go out and have fun.

1366
01:35:19,631 --> 01:35:21,496
OK, Yvonne. I'm ready.

1367
01:35:21,674 --> 01:35:23,210
Yes, just a second.

1368
01:35:23,843 --> 01:35:27,461
It's all ready.
You just have to serve it.

1369
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:30,176
If there's a problem, call me.

1370
01:35:34,854 --> 01:35:36,594
You'll call me?

1371
01:35:38,816 --> 01:35:41,649
If you agree,
I'll serve you your dinner.

1372
01:35:43,154 --> 01:35:46,146
Take the coat off.
It's like being in a madhouse.

1373
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:48,689
All right.

1374
01:35:48,868 --> 01:35:50,529
Got a cigarette?

1375
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:52,451
No, I don't smoke.

1376
01:35:52,622 --> 01:35:53,611
Well, I used to.

1377
01:35:54,249 --> 01:35:57,662
I gave up a short while ago
and, to be honest,

1378
01:35:57,835 --> 01:35:59,541
it would be bad for you,

1379
01:35:59,712 --> 01:36:04,547
even if you don't practice a sport,
for your lungs, your breathing...

1380
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:06,625
...and so on.

1381
01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:10,094
You're not eating?

1382
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:17,286
Watch what you're doing!

1383
01:37:17,457 --> 01:37:18,697
I'm so sorry.

1384
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:20,702
What is it?

1385
01:37:21,794 --> 01:37:25,503
You wanted a cranial massage.
Here's Mr. Jacquet.

1386
01:37:26,257 --> 01:37:27,246
Hello, sir.

1387
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:30,212
Get out.
Leave me alone.

1388
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:33,131
- Get out!
- Is it me?

1389
01:37:33,306 --> 01:37:34,421
Not at all.

1390
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:37,299
He got up in a bad mood.
Well, got up...

1391
01:37:39,604 --> 01:37:40,764
"He got up..."

1392
01:37:40,938 --> 01:37:43,224
What a prick. Asshole.

1393
01:37:44,776 --> 01:37:46,016
Driss Bassari.

1394
01:37:46,736 --> 01:37:47,725
Your turn.

1395
01:38:03,044 --> 01:38:05,501
You got your license a month ago?

1396
01:38:05,671 --> 01:38:07,252
I'd driven before.

1397
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:11,295
Mostly on private roads, tracks,

1398
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:14,757
estates, parking lots.
I'm a good driver.

1399
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:20,016
I read your application.

1400
01:38:20,186 --> 01:38:23,678
You used one word
to describe yourself: pragmatic.

1401
01:38:23,981 --> 01:38:24,970
Yes.

1402
01:38:25,983 --> 01:38:27,473
That's important.

1403
01:38:27,652 --> 01:38:31,019
There's another idea here
that you forgot to mention.

1404
01:38:31,197 --> 01:38:32,403
Really?

1405
01:38:33,616 --> 01:38:36,358
Maybe you should consider
reading our slogan.

1406
01:38:36,536 --> 01:38:38,072
That's an alexandrine.

1407
01:38:38,788 --> 01:38:39,698
I'm sorry?

1408
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:41,783
May-be you should

1409
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:45,246
con-si-der read-ing our slo-gan.
Twelve feet.

1410
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:47,827
It wasn't deliberate.

1411
01:38:48,423 --> 01:38:50,288
"In time and on time."

1412
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:54,426
And you have Dali's melting clocks
for the artistic side.

1413
01:38:55,721 --> 01:38:56,801
Maybe, yes.

1414
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:00,260
Do you like art?

1415
01:39:00,435 --> 01:39:01,641
Yes.

1416
01:39:01,811 --> 01:39:03,802
- I like Michelangelo.
- Not bad.

1417
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:06,141
But I prefer the other Turtles.

1418
01:39:18,744 --> 01:39:19,733
I'm coming!

1419
01:39:21,038 --> 01:39:22,153
Just a second!

1420
01:39:26,335 --> 01:39:27,324
Are you OK?

1421
01:39:28,838 --> 01:39:30,169
Get the hell out.

1422
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:32,830
Some water? A compress?

1423
01:39:35,511 --> 01:39:36,500
Get out.

1424
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:40,258
Get out!

1425
01:39:48,733 --> 01:39:49,722
Thanks, Bruno.

1426
01:39:49,901 --> 01:39:51,391
Have a good weekend.

1427
01:39:51,569 --> 01:39:52,854
See you on Monday.

1428
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:54,731
What's wrong?

1429
01:39:54,906 --> 01:39:56,146
He's in a bad way.

1430
01:39:57,241 --> 01:40:00,028
- Where is he?
- Just now, he was in the garden.

1431
01:40:14,884 --> 01:40:16,875
Hey, what's up, bro?

1432
01:40:18,262 --> 01:40:19,877
What's with the beard?

1433
01:40:21,891 --> 01:40:22,801
Serpico?

1434
01:40:22,975 --> 01:40:24,010
Jean Jaurès?

1435
01:40:24,185 --> 01:40:25,800
A metro station anyhow.

1436
01:40:25,978 --> 01:40:26,967
Victor Hugo?

1437
01:40:28,523 --> 01:40:30,605
You've let yourself go.

1438
01:40:30,775 --> 01:40:32,356
Good thing I'm back.

1439
01:40:32,527 --> 01:40:33,607
I'll be right in.

1440
01:41:27,873 --> 01:41:29,204
What do we do now?

1441
01:41:30,001 --> 01:41:31,741
You let me handle it now.

1442
01:43:17,024 --> 01:43:18,434
Not bad, huh?

1443
01:43:41,132 --> 01:43:43,168
A quick cut would settle it.

1444
01:43:44,552 --> 01:43:47,089
You're in great shape. I love it.

1445
01:43:50,683 --> 01:43:53,595
OK, you can open your eyes now.

1446
01:43:54,186 --> 01:43:55,301
That's hideous.

1447
01:43:55,813 --> 01:43:56,848
It's hideous!

1448
01:43:57,398 --> 01:43:58,934
- Horrible.
- It suits you.

1449
01:43:59,108 --> 01:44:00,097
No.

1450
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:03,602
Look! Sleeveless leather vest,

1451
01:44:03,779 --> 01:44:06,737
spiked bracelet,
Village People style cap.

1452
01:44:06,907 --> 01:44:09,319
Got it! Freddie Mercury!

1453
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:11,529
You look just like him!

1454
01:44:11,704 --> 01:44:14,616
That's wicked.
You look like an orthodox priest.

1455
01:44:14,790 --> 01:44:15,779
Or a Cossack!

1456
01:44:18,669 --> 01:44:20,034
Come on!

1457
01:44:21,630 --> 01:44:23,245
He's crazy.

1458
01:44:23,424 --> 01:44:25,130
What are you doing?

1459
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:27,925
I expect the worst.

1460
01:44:28,137 --> 01:44:29,422
No, this one's good. Look.

1461
01:44:33,058 --> 01:44:34,423
My grandfather.

1462
01:44:34,602 --> 01:44:35,682
Really?

1463
01:44:36,061 --> 01:44:38,768
Philippe, this mustache of yours,

1464
01:44:38,939 --> 01:44:40,850
it really turns me on.

1465
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:42,390
I'll shave it all off.

1466
01:44:42,568 --> 01:44:43,978
- Thank you.
- All right.

1467
01:44:45,696 --> 01:44:47,812
No, that's not funny.

1468
01:44:50,826 --> 01:44:52,032
Nein!

1469
01:44:52,203 --> 01:44:53,409
That's what you mean.

1470
01:44:53,829 --> 01:44:55,160
No, I don't agree.

1471
01:44:56,081 --> 01:44:58,788
Philippe, very angry.

1472
01:44:58,959 --> 01:45:01,166
I'm just your plaything now.

1473
01:45:02,171 --> 01:45:04,332
You'll end up in the loony bin.

1474
01:45:04,507 --> 01:45:06,839
Don't you feel like starting a war?

1475
01:45:07,009 --> 01:45:11,173
I think it's time
to shave all this off now.

1476
01:45:11,764 --> 01:45:13,300
You're having fun?

1477
01:45:13,474 --> 01:45:16,056
You bet. How about Nazi invalids?

1478
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:18,934
It must have been weird
saluting like this.

1479
01:45:21,690 --> 01:45:24,557
You've had your fun now.
Get rid of it.

1480
01:45:37,164 --> 01:45:39,075
A booking in the name of Bassari.

1481
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:40,786
Table number eight.

1482
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:41,949
Follow me, please.

1483
01:45:47,758 --> 01:45:48,873
This way.

1484
01:46:11,282 --> 01:46:14,240
I'm not staying for lunch, Philippe.

1485
01:46:16,412 --> 01:46:18,368
- Why not?
- But you won't be alone.

1486
01:46:19,582 --> 01:46:22,870
Actually, you have a date.

1487
01:46:23,252 --> 01:46:24,742
A date?

1488
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,000
What's going on?

1489
01:46:27,298 --> 01:46:29,129
Don't panic. It'll be fine.

1490
01:46:30,301 --> 01:46:32,337
Only this time, you can't split.

1491
01:46:34,597 --> 01:46:35,712
By the way...

1492
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:38,972
...it took me a while,

1493
01:46:39,143 --> 01:46:40,383
but I found it.

1494
01:46:41,228 --> 01:46:42,934
Give her a kiss for me.

1495
01:46:44,273 --> 01:46:45,262
Driss!

1496
01:46:47,234 --> 01:46:48,223
Driss!

1497
01:46:51,196 --> 01:46:53,562
What's this all about?

1498
01:47:13,427 --> 01:47:14,542
Hello, Philippe.

1499
01:47:55,386 --> 01:47:58,253
Philippe Pozzo Di Borgo
now lives in Morocco.

1500
01:47:58,430 --> 01:48:01,843
He has remarried
and has two young daughters.

1501
01:48:05,396 --> 01:48:10,982
Abdel Sellou has his own firm.
He is married, with three children.
