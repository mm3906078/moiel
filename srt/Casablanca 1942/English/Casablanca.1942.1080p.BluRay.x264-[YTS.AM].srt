00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,668
With the coming
of the Second World War...

3
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:19,000
...many eyes in imprisoned Europe
turned hopefully, or desperately...

4
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:22,007
...toward the freedom of the Americas.

5
00:01:22,247 --> 00:01:24,875
Lisbon became
the great embarkation point.

6
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:28,247
But not everybody could get
to Lisbon directly.

7
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:32,350
And so a torturous, roundabout
refugee trail sprang up.

8
00:01:33,392 --> 00:01:35,019
Paris to Marseilles...

9
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:43,695
...across the Mediterranean to Oran.

10
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:55,503
Then, by train or auto or foot,
across the rim of Africa...

11
00:01:55,714 --> 00:01:58,205
...to Casablanca in French Morocco.

12
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:02,978
Here, the fortunate ones,
through money or influence or luck...

13
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:06,655
...might obtain exit visas
and scurry to Lisbon.

14
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:09,256
And from Lisbon to the New World.

15
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:12,658
But the others wait in Casablanca.

16
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:16,824
And wait and wait...

17
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:18,799
...and wait.

18
00:02:28,447 --> 00:02:30,039
To all officers:

19
00:02:30,215 --> 00:02:35,084
Two German couriers carrying official
documents murdered on train from Oran.

20
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:38,279
Murderer and possible accomplices
headed for Casablanca.

21
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,290
Round up all suspicious characters
and search them for stolen document.

22
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:44,059
Important.

23
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,227
May we see your papers?

24
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:19,224
I don't think I have them on me.

25
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:22,730
- In that case, you'll have to come along.
- Wait. It's possible that I...

26
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:24,994
Yes. Here they are.

27
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,075
These papers expired three weeks ago.
You'll have to come along.

28
00:03:31,276 --> 00:03:32,903
Halt!

29
00:03:33,645 --> 00:03:35,169
Halt!

30
00:04:00,038 --> 00:04:02,802
- What on earth is going on there?
- I don't know, my dear.

31
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,475
Pardon, monsieur. Pardon, madame.
Have you not heard?

32
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:08,442
We hear very little,
and we understand even less.

33
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:12,276
Two German couriers were found murdered
in the desert. The unoccupied desert.

34
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:14,975
This is the customary roundup
of refugees, liberals...

35
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:18,783
...and, of course, a beautiful young girl
for Renault, the prefect of police.

36
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:27,421
Along with these unhappy refugees, the scum
of Europe has gravitated to Casablanca.

37
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:29,999
Some of them have been waiting
years for a visa.

38
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:33,467
I beg of you, monsieur, watch yourself.
Be on guard.

39
00:04:33,672 --> 00:04:35,663
This place is full of vultures.

40
00:04:35,841 --> 00:04:38,571
Vultures everywhere. Everywhere!

41
00:04:38,744 --> 00:04:41,212
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Not at all.

42
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:45,247
What an amusing little fellow.

43
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,747
Waiter.

44
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:50,152
- Oh, how silly of me.
- What, dear?

45
00:04:50,322 --> 00:04:52,688
I've left my wallet in the hotel.

46
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,508
Perhaps tomorrow
we'll be on the plane.

47
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:39,928
It is good to see you again,
Major Strasser.

48
00:05:40,138 --> 00:05:41,298
Thank you, thank you.

49
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,770
May I present Captain Renault,
police prefect of Casablanca. Major Strasser.

50
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:47,969
Unoccupied France welcomes you
to Casablanca.

51
00:05:48,313 --> 00:05:50,144
Thank you, captain.
It's good to be here.

52
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,977
Major Strasser, my aide,
Lieutenant Casselle.

53
00:05:53,151 --> 00:05:55,619
Captain Tonnelli.
The Italian service at your command.

54
00:05:55,787 --> 00:05:56,981
That is kind of you.

55
00:06:03,462 --> 00:06:06,295
You may find the climate
of Casablanca a trifle warm.

56
00:06:06,465 --> 00:06:10,128
We Germans must get used to all climates,
from Russia to the Sahara.

57
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:13,404
- Perhaps you weren't referring to weather.
- What else?

58
00:06:13,572 --> 00:06:15,836
The murder of the couriers.
What has been done?

59
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:19,808
My men are rounding up
twice the usual number of suspects.

60
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:23,004
- But we know already who the murderer is.
- Good. Is he in custody?

61
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:26,150
No hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's.
Everybody comes to Rick's.

62
00:06:26,318 --> 00:06:29,810
I've already heard about this café.
And also about Mr. Rick himself.

63
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:27,570
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

64
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,770
I'll never get out of here.

65
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:32,015
I'll die in Casablanca.

66
00:07:32,217 --> 00:07:34,447
But can't you make it just a little more?

67
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:35,608
Please?

68
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:39,222
Sorry, but diamonds are a drug
on the market. Everybody sells diamonds.

69
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:41,654
There are diamonds everywhere. 2400.

70
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,986
All right.

71
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:46,130
The trucks are waiting.
The men are waiting. Everything--

72
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:52,060
It's the fishing smack Santiago.

73
00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:56,640
It leaves at 1 tomorrow night,
here from the end of La Medina. Third boat.

74
00:07:56,842 --> 00:08:00,107
- Thank you. Thank you.
- And bring 15,000 francs in cash.

75
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:02,576
Remember, in cash.

76
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:10,447
Cheerio.

77
00:08:11,356 --> 00:08:14,154
- Open up, Abdul.
- Yes, professor.

78
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:24,897
- Waiter?
- Yes, madame?

79
00:08:25,103 --> 00:08:27,765
Will you ask Rick
if he'll have a drink with us?

80
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:31,439
Madame, he never drinks with customers.
Never. I have never seen it.

81
00:08:32,277 --> 00:08:34,472
What makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?

82
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,513
Perhaps if you told him I ran the
second-largest banking house in Amsterdam.

83
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:41,345
Second largest?
That wouldn't impress Rick.

84
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,081
The leading banker in Amsterdam
is now the pastry chef in our kitchen.

85
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,781
We have something
to look forward to.

86
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:51,289
And his father is the bellboy.

87
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:22,492
Excuse me.

88
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,125
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a private room.

89
00:09:27,432 --> 00:09:30,924
Of all the nerve. Who do you think--?
I know there is gambling in there.

90
00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:34,231
- You dare not keep me out.
- Yes? What's the trouble?

91
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:37,431
I have been in every gambling room
between Honolulu and Berlin.

92
00:09:37,642 --> 00:09:41,669
And if you think I'm going to be kept out
of a saloon like this, you're much mistaken.

93
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,814
Excuse me, please.
Hello, Rick.

94
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,282
Your cash is good at the bar.

95
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,451
What? Do you know who I am?

96
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:52,623
I do. You're lucky the bar is open to you.

97
00:09:52,824 --> 00:09:55,793
This is outrageous!
I shall report it to The Angriff.

98
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:03,124
You know, watching you just now, one would
think you've been doing this all your life.

99
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:06,134
- What makes you think I haven't?
- Nothing.

100
00:10:06,338 --> 00:10:10,297
- But when you first came, I thought--
- You thought what?

101
00:10:10,742 --> 00:10:12,972
What right do I have to think?

102
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:19,277
May I?

103
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:22,978
Too bad about those two
German couriers, wasn't it?

104
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,817
They got a lucky break.
Yesterday they were just clerks...

105
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:28,255
...today they are the honored dead.

106
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,318
You are a very cynical person, Rick,
if you'll forgive me for saying so.

107
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:33,623
I forgive you.

108
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:35,493
- Will you have a drink with me?
- No.

109
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,669
I forgot, you never drink with--
I'll have another, please.

110
00:10:39,604 --> 00:10:41,333
You despise me, don't you?

111
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:43,698
If I gave you any thought,
I probably would.

112
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,206
But why?

113
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:48,307
Do you object to the kind of business I do?

114
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:53,474
But think of all those poor refugees who
must rot in this place if I didn't help them.

115
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:58,247
That's not so bad. Through ways of my own,
I provide them with exit visas.

116
00:10:58,456 --> 00:11:00,686
For a price, Ugarte. For a price.

117
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:05,253
But think of all the poor devils
who can't meet Renault's price.

118
00:11:05,463 --> 00:11:08,864
I get it for them for half.
Is that so parasitic?

119
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:12,629
I don't mind a parasite.
I object to a cut-rate one.

120
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:16,205
Well, after tonight I will be through
with the whole business.

121
00:11:16,374 --> 00:11:19,070
And I'm leaving, finally,
this Casablanca.

122
00:11:19,244 --> 00:11:22,304
Who did you bribe for your visa?
Renault or yourself?

123
00:11:22,647 --> 00:11:25,980
Myself.
I found myself much more reasonable.

124
00:11:26,484 --> 00:11:27,508
Look, Rick.

125
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:29,853
Know what this is?

126
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,155
Something that even you have never seen.

127
00:11:33,358 --> 00:11:36,486
Letters of transit signed
by General de Gaulle.

128
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:39,993
Cannot be rescinded.
Not even questioned.

129
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:41,154
One moment.

130
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:44,631
Tonight I'll be selling those
for more money than I ever dreamed of.

131
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:47,636
And then, addio, Casablanca.

132
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:52,135
I have many a friend in Casablanca,
but somehow, just because you despise me...

133
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,777
...you are the only one I trust.

134
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,842
Will you keep these for me, please?

135
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:58,811
- For how long?
- Perhaps an hour. Perhaps a little longer.

136
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,748
- I don't want them here overnight.
- Don't be afraid of that.

137
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,512
Please keep them for me.

138
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,883
Thank you.
I knew I could trust you.

139
00:12:06,424 --> 00:12:08,392
Waiter. I'll be expecting some people.

140
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,461
If anybody asks for me,
I'll be right here.

141
00:12:12,697 --> 00:12:13,686
Rick...

142
00:12:13,898 --> 00:12:15,991
...I hope you're more impressed
with me now.

143
00:12:17,335 --> 00:12:20,600
If you'll forgive me, I'll share my good luck
with your roulette wheel.

144
00:12:20,772 --> 00:12:21,864
Just a moment.

145
00:12:23,908 --> 00:12:28,072
I heard a rumor those two German couriers
were carrying letters of transit.

146
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:34,348
I've heard that rumor too. Poor devils.

147
00:12:34,552 --> 00:12:38,511
You're right, Ugarte.
I am a little more impressed with you.

148
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:01,371
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Ferrari.

149
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:03,166
How's business at the Blue Parrot?

150
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:05,866
- Fine, but I'd like to buy your café.
- It's not for sale.

151
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:09,274
- You haven't heard my offer.
- It's not for sale at any price.

152
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:13,008
- What do you want for Sam?
- I don't buy or sell human beings.

153
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:15,345
Too bad.
That's Casablanca's leading commodity.

154
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:19,614
In refugees alone we could make a fortune,
if you'd work with me in the black market.

155
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,191
Suppose you run your business
and let me run mine.

156
00:14:22,994 --> 00:14:25,462
Suppose we ask Sam.
Maybe he'd like to make a change.

157
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,722
Suppose we do.

158
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:31,858
When will you realize that in this world today
isolationism is no longer a practical policy?

159
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,799
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him
at the Blue Parrot.

160
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:36,065
Oh, I like it fine here.

161
00:14:36,274 --> 00:14:40,142
- He'll double what I pay you.
- I ain't got time to spend what I make here.

162
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:42,606
Sorry.

163
00:14:45,984 --> 00:14:47,781
The boss's private stock...

164
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:50,386
- ...because, Yvonne, I love you.
- Oh, shut up.

165
00:14:50,588 --> 00:14:54,581
All right, all right. For you, I shut up,
because, Yvonne, I love you.

166
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:01,926
Some Germans gave this check.
Is it all right?

167
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:08,434
Where were you last night?

168
00:15:08,606 --> 00:15:10,870
That's so long ago,
I don't remember.

169
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:14,542
- Will I see you tonight?
- I never make plans that far ahead.

170
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:17,075
Give me another.

171
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:20,012
- Sascha, she's had enough.
- Don't listen to him. Fill it up.

172
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,380
Yvonne, I love you,
but he pays me.

173
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:25,078
- Rick, I'm tired of having you--
- Sascha, call a cab.

174
00:15:25,256 --> 00:15:27,656
- We're gonna get your coat.
- Take your hands off me.

175
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:30,386
You're going home.
You've had a little too much to drink.

176
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:34,832
Hey, taxi.

177
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,694
Who do you think you are,
pushing me around?

178
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:39,632
I was a fool
to fall for a man like you.

179
00:15:39,804 --> 00:15:41,829
Go with her, Sascha.
Be sure she gets home.

180
00:15:42,006 --> 00:15:42,995
And come right back.

181
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,675
Yes, boss.

182
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:58,115
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Louis.

183
00:15:58,323 --> 00:16:00,587
How extravagant you are,
throwing away women.

184
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:02,487
Someday they may be scarce.

185
00:16:02,994 --> 00:16:04,928
I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne.

186
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:06,721
Maybe get her on the rebound.

187
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:09,025
When it comes to women,
you're a true democrat.

188
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,302
If he gets a word in,
it'll be a major Italian victory.

189
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:28,312
The plane to Lisbon.

190
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:34,788
You would like to be on it?

191
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:36,654
Why? What's in Lisbon?

192
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:38,895
The clipper to America.

193
00:16:39,097 --> 00:16:41,793
I've often speculated on why
you don't return to America.

194
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,936
Did you abscond with the church funds?
Did you run off with a senator's wife?

195
00:16:46,337 --> 00:16:48,999
I like to think you killed a man.
It's the romantic in me.

196
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:50,868
It's a combination of all three.

197
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:53,509
And what in heaven's name
brought you to Casablanca?

198
00:16:53,678 --> 00:16:56,146
My health.
I came to Casablanca for the waters.

199
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:59,610
The waters? What waters?
We're in the desert.

200
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:02,015
I was misinformed.

201
00:17:04,622 --> 00:17:05,953
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick.

202
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:08,957
A gentleman inside
has won 20,000 francs...

203
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:11,522
...and the cashier
would like some money.

204
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:14,126
I'll get it from the safe.

205
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,857
I'm so upset, Rick. You know I--

206
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:18,661
Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that
happen all the time.

207
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,633
I'm awfully sorry.

208
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,873
Rick, there will be some excitement
here tonight. An arrest in your café.

209
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:31,777
- Again?
- This is no ordinary arrest.

210
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:33,348
A murderer, no less.

211
00:17:33,985 --> 00:17:37,580
If you're thinking of warning him,
don't put yourself out. He cannot escape.

212
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:41,589
- I stick my neck out for nobody.
- A wise foreign policy.

213
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,855
Could have made the arrest earlier,
at the Blue Parrot.

214
00:17:48,032 --> 00:17:50,159
Out of my regard for you,
we're staging it here.

215
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,825
It will amuse your customers.

216
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:54,496
Our entertainment's enough.

217
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,132
We're to have an important guest
here tonight.

218
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,833
Major Strasser of the Third Reich, no less.

219
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:02,172
We want him to be here
when we make the arrest.

220
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,907
A demonstration of the efficiency
of my administration.

221
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,017
I see.
And what's Strasser doing here?

222
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:11,120
He certainly didn't come here to witness
a demonstration of your efficiency.

223
00:18:11,322 --> 00:18:12,414
- Perhaps not.
- Here.

224
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,717
- It shall not happen again.
- That's all right.

225
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:17,759
Louis, you got something on your mind.
Why don't you spill it.

226
00:18:17,962 --> 00:18:19,452
How observant you are.

227
00:18:19,797 --> 00:18:22,493
As a matter of fact,
I wanted to give you a word of advice.

228
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:23,656
Yeah?

229
00:18:23,968 --> 00:18:26,232
- Have a brandy?
- Thank you.

230
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:31,365
There are many exit visas sold in this café,
but we know that you've never sold one.

231
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:34,037
That is the reason
we permit you to remain open.

232
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:36,510
I thought it was because
I let you win at roulette.

233
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:37,909
That is another reason.

234
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:40,880
There is a man arrived in Casablanca
on his way to America.

235
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:43,952
He will offer a fortune to anyone
who'll furnish an exit visa.

236
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:46,646
- What's his name?
- Victor Laszlo.

237
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,424
Victor Laszlo?

238
00:18:48,593 --> 00:18:51,187
Rick, that is the first time
I've seen you so impressed.

239
00:18:51,362 --> 00:18:53,353
He's succeeded in impressing
half the world.

240
00:18:53,531 --> 00:18:56,989
It's my duty to see that
he doesn't impress the other half.

241
00:18:57,168 --> 00:19:00,137
Laszlo must never reach America.
He stays in Casablanca.

242
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:02,406
It'll be interesting
to see how he manages.

243
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:04,734
- Manages what?
- His escape.

244
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:06,807
- But I just told you--
- Stop it.

245
00:19:06,978 --> 00:19:10,641
He escaped from a concentration camp.
The Nazis have chased him all over Europe.

246
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:12,146
This is the end of the chase.

247
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,944
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.

248
00:19:15,186 --> 00:19:16,483
Is that a serious offer?

249
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:19,015
I just paid out 20,
and I'd like to get it back.

250
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:22,019
Make it 10.
I'm only a poor corrupt official.

251
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:24,021
- Okay.
- Done.

252
00:19:24,228 --> 00:19:28,221
No matter how clever he is, he still
needs an exit visa. Or I should say two.

253
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,725
- Why two?
- He is traveling with a lady.

254
00:19:30,935 --> 00:19:33,631
- He'll take one.
- I think not. I've seen the lady.

255
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:36,566
And if he did not leave her
in Marseilles or Oran...

256
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:39,201
...he certainly won't leave her
in Casablanca.

257
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,537
Maybe he's not quite
as romantic as you are.

258
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:44,977
It doesn't matter.
There is no exit visa for him.

259
00:19:45,616 --> 00:19:49,211
What ever gave you the impression
that I might help Laszlo escape?

260
00:19:49,587 --> 00:19:52,750
Because, my dear Ricky,
I suspect that under that cynical shell...

261
00:19:52,924 --> 00:19:54,653
...you are at heart a sentimentalist.

262
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:58,228
Laugh if you will,
but I happen to be familiar with your record.

263
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,556
Let me point out just two items:

264
00:20:00,898 --> 00:20:04,891
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.

265
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:08,971
In 1936, you fought in Spain
on the Loyalist side.

266
00:20:09,173 --> 00:20:11,471
And got well paid for it on both occasions.

267
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:13,974
The winning side would
have paid you much better.

268
00:20:14,412 --> 00:20:15,401
Maybe.

269
00:20:16,447 --> 00:20:18,642
It seems you're determined
to keep Laszlo here.

270
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,613
I have my orders.

271
00:20:21,385 --> 00:20:23,250
I see. Gestapo spank.

272
00:20:23,454 --> 00:20:26,252
My dear Ricky, you overestimate
the influence of the Gestapo.

273
00:20:26,457 --> 00:20:29,790
I don't interfere with them,
and they don't interfere with me.

274
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:32,087
In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.

275
00:20:32,263 --> 00:20:34,390
- I am--
- Major Strasser is here, sir.

276
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:36,795
- You were saying?
- Excuse me.

277
00:20:46,611 --> 00:20:49,808
Carl, see that Major Strasser
gets a good table, close to the ladies.

278
00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:54,610
I have already given him the best, knowing
he is German and would take it anyway.

279
00:20:56,754 --> 00:20:59,951
Take him quietly.
Two guards at every door.

280
00:21:04,362 --> 00:21:06,887
- Everything is ready, sir.
- Go ahead.

281
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:14,935
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, captain.

282
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:17,131
- Won't you join us?
- Thank you.

283
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:21,940
- It's a pleasure to have you here, major.
- Champagne and a tin of caviar.

284
00:21:22,146 --> 00:21:25,513
May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26,
a good French wine.

285
00:21:25,683 --> 00:21:27,674
Very well, sir.

286
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:31,183
- A very interesting club.
- Especially so tonight, major.

287
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:34,984
In a few minutes you'll see the arrest
of the man who murdered your couriers.

288
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:36,683
I expected no less, captain.

289
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,486
Monsieur Ugarte.

290
00:21:41,532 --> 00:21:43,898
- Will you please come with us?
- Certainly.

291
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:47,134
May I first please cash my chips?

292
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:56,907
Very lucky, huh? Two thousand, please.

293
00:22:18,803 --> 00:22:20,737
Rick! Rick, help me!

294
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:25,033
- Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
- But, Rick, hide me. Do something!

295
00:22:32,717 --> 00:22:34,014
Excellent, captain.

296
00:22:34,218 --> 00:22:36,846
When they come for me,
I hope you'll be more of a help.

297
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:39,114
I stick my neck out for nobody.

298
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:43,156
I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks,
but it's all over now.

299
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:46,888
Just sit down and have a good time.
Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.

300
00:22:54,705 --> 00:22:58,163
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser
of the Third Reich.

301
00:22:58,342 --> 00:23:00,242
- How do you do, Mr. Rick?
- How do you do?

302
00:23:00,411 --> 00:23:02,538
You already know Herr Heinze
of the Third Reich.

303
00:23:02,747 --> 00:23:05,215
Please join us, Mr. Rick.

304
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:10,377
We are very honored tonight.

305
00:23:10,554 --> 00:23:14,718
Major Strasser is one of the reasons
the Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.

306
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:17,861
You repeat Third Reich
as though you expected there to be others.

307
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:20,656
Well, personally, major,
I will take what comes.

308
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,858
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

309
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:26,628
- Unofficially, of course.
- Make it official if you like.

310
00:23:26,804 --> 00:23:29,398
- What is your nationality?
- I'm a drunkard.

311
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:33,033
And that makes Rick a citizen
of the world.

312
00:23:33,344 --> 00:23:35,869
I was born in New York City,
if that'll help you any.

313
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:39,577
I understand you came here from Paris
at the time of the occupation.

314
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,513
There seems to be no secret about that.

315
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:45,883
Are you one of those people who cannot
imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?

316
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,287
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

317
00:23:48,492 --> 00:23:50,357
Can you imagine us in London?

318
00:23:51,495 --> 00:23:52,985
When you get there, ask me.

319
00:23:53,464 --> 00:23:54,624
Diplomatist.

320
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:55,959
How about New York?

321
00:23:56,133 --> 00:24:01,002
Well, there are sections of New York, major,
that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.

322
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:04,406
- Who do you think will win the war?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

323
00:24:04,575 --> 00:24:09,239
Rick is completely neutral about everything.
And that takes in the field of women too.

324
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:13,713
You were not always so carefully neutral.
We have a complete dossier on you.

325
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:19,719
"Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37.
Cannot return to his country."

326
00:24:20,491 --> 00:24:23,483
The reason is a little vague.
We also know what you did in Paris.

327
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:27,392
And also we know why you left Paris.
Don't worry, we're not going to broadcast it.

328
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:28,793
Are my eyes really brown?

329
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,197
You will forgive my curiosity,
Mr. Blaine. The point is...

330
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,600
...an enemy of the Reich
has come to Casablanca...

331
00:24:34,772 --> 00:24:37,764
...and we are checking up on anybody
who can be of any help to us.

332
00:24:37,975 --> 00:24:42,002
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo
stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

333
00:24:42,847 --> 00:24:45,941
In this case you have no sympathy
for the fox?

334
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:49,608
Not particularly. I understand
the point of view of the hound too.

335
00:24:49,887 --> 00:24:52,788
Laszlo published the foulest lies
in the Prague newspapers...

336
00:24:52,957 --> 00:24:54,549
...until the day we marched in.

337
00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:59,059
And even after that, he continued
to print scandal sheets in his cellar.

338
00:24:59,263 --> 00:25:01,925
Of course, one must admit
he has great courage.

339
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:05,325
I admit he's clever.
Three times he slipped through our fingers.

340
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:09,439
In Paris he continued his activities.
We intend not to let it happen again.

341
00:25:09,607 --> 00:25:13,065
Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business
is politics, mine is running a saloon.

342
00:25:13,277 --> 00:25:15,108
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

343
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,271
You see, major?
You have nothing to worry about Rick.

344
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,015
Perhaps.

345
00:25:25,256 --> 00:25:29,124
- I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
- Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.

346
00:25:56,287 --> 00:25:58,016
Two Cointreaux, please.

347
00:26:00,124 --> 00:26:02,524
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.

348
00:26:02,793 --> 00:26:05,819
Victor, I feel somehow
we shouldn't stay here.

349
00:26:05,996 --> 00:26:08,931
If we would walk out so soon
it would only call attention to us.

350
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,297
Perhaps Ugarte is in
some other part of the café.

351
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:16,801
Excuse me, but you look like a couple
who are on their way to America.

352
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:21,508
You'll find a market there for this ring.
I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.

353
00:26:21,712 --> 00:26:24,203
- Thank you, but I hardly think...
- Perhaps for the lady.

354
00:26:24,415 --> 00:26:25,882
The ring is quite unique.

355
00:26:28,018 --> 00:26:31,681
- Yes, I'm very interested.
- Good.

356
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:33,280
What is your name?

357
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:35,755
Berger, Norwegian.
At your service, sir.

358
00:26:37,361 --> 00:26:39,522
I'll meet you in a few minutes
at the bar.

359
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:42,290
We don't want the ring,
but thanks for showing it to us.

360
00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:45,526
- Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
- I'm sorry, it is.

361
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:50,466
- Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
- Yes?

362
00:26:50,674 --> 00:26:52,665
I am Captain Renault,
prefect of police.

363
00:26:52,843 --> 00:26:54,003
Yes, what is it you want?

364
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:57,305
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca
and wish you a pleasant stay.

365
00:26:57,515 --> 00:27:00,211
It isn't often we have
so distinguished a visitor.

366
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:02,851
Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me, captain.

367
00:27:03,053 --> 00:27:06,545
The present French administration
hasn't always been so cordial.

368
00:27:06,757 --> 00:27:08,622
May I present Miss Ilsa Lund.

369
00:27:10,394 --> 00:27:13,295
I was told you were the most
beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca.

370
00:27:13,464 --> 00:27:15,261
That was a gross understatement.

371
00:27:15,733 --> 00:27:16,757
You're very kind.

372
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:19,458
- Won't you join us?
- If you will permit me.

373
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:24,398
Oh, no, Emile, please. A bottle of your
best champagne. And put it on my bill.

374
00:27:24,575 --> 00:27:28,944
It's a game we play. They put it on the bill,
I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.

375
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,878
Captain,
the boy who's playing the piano...

376
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,018
Somewhere I've seen him.

377
00:27:35,219 --> 00:27:36,743
- Sam?
- Yes.

378
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:38,650
He came from Paris with Rick.

379
00:27:38,822 --> 00:27:40,289
Rick? Who is he?

380
00:27:40,457 --> 00:27:43,858
- Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's. Rick is...
- Is what?

381
00:27:44,061 --> 00:27:47,326
Mademoiselle, he's the kind of man that,
well, if I were a woman...

382
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:50,227
...and I were not around,
I should be in love with Rick.

383
00:27:50,434 --> 00:27:53,961
But what a fool I am talking
to a beautiful woman about another man.

384
00:27:55,406 --> 00:27:56,430
Excuse me.

385
00:27:56,607 --> 00:27:58,438
Major.

386
00:27:59,977 --> 00:28:03,105
Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo,
may I present Major Strasser.

387
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,304
How do you do?

388
00:28:04,481 --> 00:28:06,472
This is a pleasure
I have looked forward to.

389
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:09,209
I'm sure you'll excuse me
if I'm not gracious.

390
00:28:09,386 --> 00:28:11,513
You see, Major Strasser,
I am a Czechoslovakian.

391
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:15,816
You were a Czechoslovakian.
Now you are a subject of the German Reich.

392
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:20,452
I have never accepted that privilege.
And I'm now on French soil.

393
00:28:20,664 --> 00:28:24,430
I should like to discuss some matters arising
from your presence on French soil.

394
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,229
This is hardly the time or place.

395
00:28:26,437 --> 00:28:30,840
Then we shall state another time and place.
Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.

396
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:32,269
With mademoiselle.

397
00:28:33,911 --> 00:28:36,971
Captain, I am under your authority.

398
00:28:37,147 --> 00:28:39,206
Is it your order
that we come to your office?

399
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:43,284
Let us say it is my request.
That is a much more pleasant word.

400
00:28:43,487 --> 00:28:44,784
Very well.

401
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:52,019
A very clever tactical retreat, major.

402
00:28:52,463 --> 00:28:56,297
- This time they really mean to stop me.
- Victor, I'm afraid for you.

403
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,362
We've been in difficult places before,
haven't we?

404
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,604
I must find out what Berger knows.

405
00:29:34,805 --> 00:29:38,002
- Be careful.
- I will. Don't worry.

406
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:58,521
Monsieur Berger, the ring.
Could I see it again?

407
00:29:59,129 --> 00:30:00,687
Champagne cocktail, please.

408
00:30:01,532 --> 00:30:04,262
I recognize you from the news photographs,
Monsieur Laszlo.

409
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:07,404
In a concentration camp,
one is apt to lose a little weight.

410
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:10,563
We read five times that you were killed
in five different places.

411
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:13,607
As you see,
it was true every single time.

412
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:15,335
Thank heaven I found you, Berger.

413
00:30:15,512 --> 00:30:19,039
I'm looking for a man by the name of Ugarte.
He's supposed to help me.

414
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:21,981
Ugarte cannot even help himself.

415
00:30:22,186 --> 00:30:26,384
He's under arrest for murder.
He was arrested here tonight.

416
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,116
I see.

417
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:32,652
But we who are still free will do
all we can. We are organized.

418
00:30:32,863 --> 00:30:35,058
Underground, like everywhere else.

419
00:30:35,265 --> 00:30:38,063
Tomorrow night there is a meeting
at the Caverne du Bois.

420
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:40,062
If you will come--

421
00:30:53,584 --> 00:30:55,916
Will you ask the piano player
to come over here?

422
00:30:56,086 --> 00:30:58,213
Very well, mademoiselle.

423
00:31:00,357 --> 00:31:03,690
- How's the jewelry business, Berger?
- Not so good. Check, please.

424
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:08,025
Too bad you weren't here earlier. We had
quite a bit of excitement, didn't we, Berger?

425
00:31:08,298 --> 00:31:09,765
Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.

426
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:13,369
- My bill.
- No. Two champagne cocktails. Please.

427
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:20,339
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Miss Ilsa.

428
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:23,035
I never expected to see you again.

429
00:31:23,547 --> 00:31:25,344
It's been a long time.

430
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:28,541
Yes, ma'am.
A lot of water under the bridge.

431
00:31:30,487 --> 00:31:33,388
- Some of the old songs, Sam.
- Yes, ma'am.

432
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,489
Where is Rick?

433
00:31:45,135 --> 00:31:47,569
I don't know.
I ain't seen him all night.

434
00:31:48,605 --> 00:31:51,972
- When will he be back?
- Not tonight no more. He ain't coming--

435
00:31:52,142 --> 00:31:53,871
He went home.

436
00:31:55,412 --> 00:31:58,245
- Does he always leave so early?
- He never--

437
00:31:58,415 --> 00:32:00,815
Well, he's got a girl up to the Blue Parrot.

438
00:32:01,018 --> 00:32:03,111
Goes up there all the time.

439
00:32:04,688 --> 00:32:07,350
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.

440
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:11,523
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa.
You're bad luck to him.

441
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:17,457
Play it once, Sam.
For old times' sake.

442
00:32:17,634 --> 00:32:20,000
I don't know what you mean,
Miss Ilsa.

443
00:32:20,604 --> 00:32:22,128
Play it, Sam.

444
00:32:23,106 --> 00:32:25,131
Play "As Time Goes By."

445
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:28,670
I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa.
I'm a little rusty on it.

446
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,571
I'll hum it for you.

447
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:44,626
Sing it, Sam.

448
00:33:30,774 --> 00:33:33,538
Sam, I thought I told you never to play--

449
00:33:44,187 --> 00:33:47,156
Well, you were asking about Rick,
and here he is. May I present--

450
00:33:47,357 --> 00:33:49,655
- Hello, Ilsa.
- Hello, Rick.

451
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,352
Oh, you've already met Rick, mademoiselle?
Then perhaps you also--

452
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:54,895
This is Mr. Laszlo.

453
00:33:55,098 --> 00:33:56,463
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

454
00:33:56,867 --> 00:33:58,926
One hears a great deal about Rick
in Casablanca.

455
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:01,100
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.

456
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,432
- Won't you join us for a drink?
- Rick never--

457
00:34:03,607 --> 00:34:05,472
- Thanks, I will.
- Well...

458
00:34:05,642 --> 00:34:08,577
...a precedent is being broken. Emile.

459
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:12,871
- Interesting café. I congratulate you.
- I congratulate you.

460
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,574
- What for?
- Your work.

461
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:16,446
Thank you. I try.

462
00:34:17,354 --> 00:34:19,254
We all try. You succeed.

463
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:24,324
She was asking about you earlier, Rick,
in a way that made me extremely jealous.

464
00:34:25,195 --> 00:34:26,719
I wasn't sure you were the same.

465
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:30,331
- Let's see, the last time we met--
- Was La Belle Aurore.

466
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:33,836
How nice. You remembered.

467
00:34:34,004 --> 00:34:36,802
But, of course, that was the day
the Germans marched into Paris.

468
00:34:37,007 --> 00:34:39,168
Not an easy day to forget.

469
00:34:39,943 --> 00:34:43,674
I remember every detail.
The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.

470
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:47,676
Yes. I put that dress away.

471
00:34:47,884 --> 00:34:50,216
When the Germans march out
I'll wear it again.

472
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:54,516
Ricky, you're becoming quite human.
I suppose we have to thank you for that.

473
00:34:54,925 --> 00:34:58,156
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one
to say it, but it's late.

474
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:02,423
So it is. We have a curfew in Casablanca.
It would never do for the chief of police...

475
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:04,624
...to be found drinking after hours.

476
00:35:05,402 --> 00:35:07,734
- I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
- Not at all.

477
00:35:08,038 --> 00:35:09,630
- Your check, sir.
- It's my party.

478
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,401
Another precedent gone.
This has been a very interesting evening.

479
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:17,546
I'll call you a cab.
Gasoline rationing, time of night.

480
00:35:17,714 --> 00:35:19,443
- We'll come again.
- Anytime.

481
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,709
- Say good night to Sam for me.
- I will.

482
00:35:22,686 --> 00:35:26,713
There's still nobody in the world
who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.

483
00:35:27,257 --> 00:35:29,725
He hasn't played it in a long time.

484
00:35:31,228 --> 00:35:33,196
- Good night.
- Good night.

485
00:35:33,363 --> 00:35:34,990
Night.

486
00:35:42,873 --> 00:35:45,364
A very puzzling fellow, this Rick.
What sort is he?

487
00:35:45,575 --> 00:35:48,772
I really can't say,
though I saw him quite often in Paris.

488
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:51,539
- Tomorrow at 10, at the prefect office.
- We'll be there.

489
00:35:51,715 --> 00:35:53,410
- Good night.
- Good night.

490
00:36:32,255 --> 00:36:33,779
Boss?

491
00:36:37,427 --> 00:36:39,361
- Boss?
- Yeah?

492
00:36:39,863 --> 00:36:42,923
- Boss, ain't you going to bed?
- Not right now.

493
00:36:43,133 --> 00:36:46,068
Ain't you planning on going to bed
in the near future?

494
00:36:46,336 --> 00:36:48,395
- You ever going to bed?
- No.

495
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:51,037
Well, I ain't sleepy, either.

496
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:52,401
Good, then have a drink.

497
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:54,543
- Not me, boss.
- Then don't have a drink.

498
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:56,269
Boss, let's get out of here.

499
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,005
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.

500
00:36:59,182 --> 00:37:01,776
Please, let's go.
Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.

501
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:03,953
She's coming back.
I know she's coming back.

502
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,816
We'll take the car and drive all night.

503
00:37:06,022 --> 00:37:08,855
We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing,
stay away until she's gone.

504
00:37:09,025 --> 00:37:13,394
- Shut up and go home, will you?
- No, sir, I'm staying right here.

505
00:37:18,902 --> 00:37:21,427
They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.

506
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:25,333
That's the way it goes.
One in, one out.

507
00:37:26,476 --> 00:37:28,569
- Sam.
- Yes, boss?

508
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:33,209
If it's December 1941 in Casablanca,
what time is it in New York?

509
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,842
What?

510
00:37:35,218 --> 00:37:36,708
My watch stopped.

511
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:39,716
I bet they're asleep in New York.

512
00:37:39,923 --> 00:37:42,653
I bet they're asleep all over America.

513
00:37:49,432 --> 00:37:53,630
Of all the gin joints in all the towns
in all the world...

514
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,829
...she walks into mine.

515
00:38:03,246 --> 00:38:06,010
- What's that you're playing?
- A little something of my own.

516
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:08,981
- Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
- No, I don't.

517
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,279
You played it for her.
You can play it for me.

518
00:38:11,488 --> 00:38:14,651
- I don't think I can remember--
- If she can stand it, I can.

519
00:38:14,858 --> 00:38:15,882
Play it.

520
00:38:16,993 --> 00:38:18,358
Yes, boss.

521
00:39:48,151 --> 00:39:50,847
Who are you really?
And what were you before?

522
00:39:51,154 --> 00:39:53,179
What did you do,
and what did you think?

523
00:39:53,757 --> 00:39:55,691
We said no questions.

524
00:40:00,363 --> 00:40:02,388
Here's looking at you, kid.

525
00:40:36,366 --> 00:40:38,095
A franc for your thoughts.

526
00:40:38,301 --> 00:40:40,701
In America they'd bring only a penny.

527
00:40:41,171 --> 00:40:43,105
I guess that's about all they're worth.

528
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,937
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.

529
00:40:48,745 --> 00:40:50,372
Well, I was wondering...

530
00:40:52,215 --> 00:40:56,584
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should
find you waiting for me to come along.

531
00:40:57,687 --> 00:40:59,882
Why there is no other man in my life?

532
00:41:02,225 --> 00:41:04,455
That's easy.
There was.

533
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:07,987
He's dead.

534
00:41:08,898 --> 00:41:10,798
I'm sorry for asking.

535
00:41:11,468 --> 00:41:13,868
I forgot we said no questions.

536
00:41:17,607 --> 00:41:21,373
Only one answer can take care
of all our questions.

537
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:10,116
Nothing can stop them now. Wednesday,
Thursday at the latest, they'll be in Paris.

538
00:42:10,293 --> 00:42:13,228
Richard, they'll find out your record.
You won't be safe here.

539
00:42:13,396 --> 00:42:16,854
I'm on their blacklist already.
Their roll of honor.

540
00:43:02,412 --> 00:43:05,006
Henri wants us to finish this bottle
and then three more.

541
00:43:05,181 --> 00:43:08,981
Says he'll water his garden with champagne
before he'll let the Germans drink it.

542
00:43:09,185 --> 00:43:12,450
This sort of takes the sting out
of being occupied, doesn't it?

543
00:43:12,655 --> 00:43:13,883
You said it.

544
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,024
Here's looking at you, kid.

545
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:45,311
My German's a little rusty.

546
00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:48,181
It's the Gestapo.

547
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:52,924
They say they expect to be
in Paris tomorrow.

548
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:57,588
They're telling us how to act
when they come marching in.

549
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:03,862
With the whole world crumbling,
we pick this time to fall in love.

550
00:44:04,073 --> 00:44:05,700
It's pretty bad timing.

551
00:44:06,009 --> 00:44:09,638
- Where were you, say, 10 years ago?
- 10 years ago?

552
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:12,714
Let's see.

553
00:44:12,949 --> 00:44:16,851
Yes, I was having a brace put on my teeth.
Where were you?

554
00:44:17,487 --> 00:44:19,011
Looking for a job.

555
00:44:25,662 --> 00:44:27,220
Was that cannon fire?

556
00:44:28,231 --> 00:44:29,630
Or is it my heart pounding?

557
00:44:29,832 --> 00:44:33,893
It's the new German 77th, and judging
by the sound, only about 35 miles away.

558
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:38,367
And getting closer every minute.

559
00:44:39,542 --> 00:44:40,668
Here, here, drink up.

560
00:44:41,511 --> 00:44:43,240
We'll never finish the other three.

561
00:44:43,446 --> 00:44:46,882
Them Germans will be here pretty soon,
and they'll come looking for you.

562
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:49,177
And don't forget,
there's a price on your head.

563
00:44:49,352 --> 00:44:52,378
I left a note in my apartment.
They'll know where to find me.

564
00:44:52,855 --> 00:44:54,186
It's strange.

565
00:44:54,924 --> 00:44:58,792
- I know so very little about you.
- I know very little about you.

566
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:01,328
Just the fact that
you had your teeth straightened.

567
00:45:02,632 --> 00:45:05,499
Be serious, darling. You are in danger.
You must leave Paris.

568
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:06,828
No, we must leave.

569
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:09,237
Yes, of course. We.

570
00:45:09,439 --> 00:45:13,170
The train for Marseilles leaves at 5:00.
I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.

571
00:45:14,577 --> 00:45:16,374
Not at my hotel. I...

572
00:45:17,447 --> 00:45:20,143
I have things to do in the city
before I leave.

573
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,377
I'll meet you at the station.

574
00:45:22,652 --> 00:45:24,779
All right, at a quarter to 5.

575
00:45:25,021 --> 00:45:26,852
Why don't we get married
in Marseilles?

576
00:45:31,527 --> 00:45:33,222
That's too far ahead to plan.

577
00:45:33,396 --> 00:45:35,193
Yes. I guess it is too far ahead.

578
00:45:36,499 --> 00:45:40,060
Let's see... What about the engineer?
Why can't he marry us on the train?

579
00:45:40,536 --> 00:45:44,233
Why not? The captain on a ship can.
It doesn't seem fair that--

580
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:47,668
Hey, what's wrong, kid?

581
00:45:54,217 --> 00:45:55,912
I love you so much.

582
00:45:58,588 --> 00:46:01,079
And I hate this war so much.

583
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:05,756
It's a crazy world.
Anything can happen.

584
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:09,365
If you shouldn't get away...

585
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,466
If something should keep us apart...

586
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:16,270
...wherever they put you...

587
00:46:16,439 --> 00:46:19,704
...and wherever I'll be,
I want you to know that I...

588
00:46:25,281 --> 00:46:26,543
Kiss me.

589
00:46:26,983 --> 00:46:29,884
Kiss me as if it were the last time.

590
00:47:05,888 --> 00:47:07,355
Where is she?
Have you seen her?

591
00:47:07,523 --> 00:47:10,048
I can't find her.
She checked out of the hotel.

592
00:47:10,259 --> 00:47:12,352
But this note came just after you left.

593
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:29,172
That's the last call, Mr. Richard.

594
00:47:29,946 --> 00:47:31,436
Do you hear me?

595
00:47:32,148 --> 00:47:35,083
Come on, Mr. Richard.
Let's get out of here. Come on.

596
00:48:26,769 --> 00:48:28,532
Rick, I have to talk to you.

597
00:48:29,939 --> 00:48:33,238
I saved my first drink
to have with you. Here.

598
00:48:33,943 --> 00:48:36,537
- No, Rick. Not tonight.
- Especially tonight.

599
00:48:38,014 --> 00:48:41,541
Why did you have to come to Casablanca?
There are other places.

600
00:48:41,751 --> 00:48:44,117
I wouldn't have come
if I'd known you were here.

601
00:48:44,854 --> 00:48:46,822
Believe me, Rick, it's true.
I didn't know.

602
00:48:46,989 --> 00:48:50,390
It's funny about your voice,
how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it.

603
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,653
"Richard, dear,
I'll go with you anyplace.

604
00:48:53,129 --> 00:48:56,496
- We'll get on a train and never stop."
- Don't, Rick.

605
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,197
I can understand how you feel.

606
00:49:00,069 --> 00:49:02,196
You understand how I feel.

607
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:04,668
How long was it we had, honey?

608
00:49:05,641 --> 00:49:07,802
- I didn't count the days.
- Well, I did.

609
00:49:08,144 --> 00:49:09,543
Every one of them.

610
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:12,113
Mostly I remember the last one.

611
00:49:13,149 --> 00:49:16,880
The wild finish. A guy standing
on a station platform in the rain...

612
00:49:17,053 --> 00:49:18,782
...with a comical look on his face...

613
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,946
...because his insides
have been kicked out.

614
00:49:22,992 --> 00:49:25,119
Can I tell you a story, Rick?

615
00:49:25,294 --> 00:49:27,819
Does it got a wild finish?

616
00:49:27,997 --> 00:49:30,124
I don't know the finish yet.

617
00:49:30,299 --> 00:49:33,735
Go on, tell it. Maybe one'll come
to you as you go along.

618
00:49:36,205 --> 00:49:39,971
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris
from her home in Oslo.

619
00:49:40,142 --> 00:49:41,871
At the house of some friends...

620
00:49:42,044 --> 00:49:44,911
...she met a man about whom
she'd heard her whole life.

621
00:49:45,081 --> 00:49:48,278
A very great and courageous man.

622
00:49:48,651 --> 00:49:50,949
He opened up for her a whole
beautiful world...

623
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,714
...full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals.

624
00:49:54,123 --> 00:49:57,991
Everything she knew
or ever became was because of him.

625
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,923
And she looked up to him...

626
00:50:00,196 --> 00:50:01,663
...and worshiped him...

627
00:50:01,864 --> 00:50:04,662
...with a feeling she supposed was love.

628
00:50:04,834 --> 00:50:06,961
Yes, that's very pretty.

629
00:50:07,136 --> 00:50:10,833
I heard a story once. In fact,
I've heard a lot of stories in my time.

630
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:13,805
They went along with the sound
of a tinny piano...

631
00:50:13,976 --> 00:50:16,308
...playing in the parlor downstairs.

632
00:50:16,779 --> 00:50:21,807
"Mister, I met a man once
when I was a kid," they'd always begin.

633
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:27,886
I guess neither one of our stories
is very funny.

634
00:50:28,057 --> 00:50:29,149
Tell me...

635
00:50:30,092 --> 00:50:32,185
...who was it you left me for?

636
00:50:32,361 --> 00:50:35,194
Was it Laszlo,
or were there others in between...

637
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:38,264
...or aren't you the kind that tells?

638
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:07,154
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the
letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.

639
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,696
I would suggest you search
the café immediately.

640
00:51:09,865 --> 00:51:12,925
If Rick has the letters, he's too smart
to let you find them there.

641
00:51:13,169 --> 00:51:15,194
You give him credit
for too much cleverness.

642
00:51:15,371 --> 00:51:17,965
My impression was he's just
another blundering American.

643
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,199
We mustn't underestimate
American blundering.

644
00:51:20,376 --> 00:51:24,312
I was with them when they blundered
into Berlin in 1918.

645
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,381
As to Laszlo,
we want him watched 24 hours a day.

646
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:31,384
It may interest you to know that
at this very moment he's on his way here.

647
00:51:36,459 --> 00:51:39,087
There is nothing we can do.

648
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:42,792
I'm delighted to see you.
Did you have a good night's rest?

649
00:51:42,965 --> 00:51:43,954
I slept very well.

650
00:51:44,133 --> 00:51:46,727
Strange. Nobody's supposed
to sleep well in Casablanca.

651
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:51,872
- May we proceed with the business?
- With pleasure. Won't you sit down?

652
00:51:54,076 --> 00:51:57,443
Laszlo, we will not mince words.
You're an escaped prisoner of the Reich.

653
00:51:57,613 --> 00:51:59,945
So far you have been fortunate
in eluding us.

654
00:52:00,416 --> 00:52:01,940
You have reached Casablanca.

655
00:52:02,184 --> 00:52:04,880
It is my duty to see
that you stay in Casablanca.

656
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:07,214
Whether or not you will succeed
is problematic.

657
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:10,154
Not at all. Renault's signature
is necessary on every visa.

658
00:52:10,326 --> 00:52:13,022
Captain, is it possible that Laszlo
will receive a visa?

659
00:52:13,195 --> 00:52:15,527
I'm afraid not. My regrets, monsieur.

660
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:17,790
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.

661
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:20,096
And mademoiselle?

662
00:52:20,269 --> 00:52:23,796
- You needn't be concerned about me.
- Is that all you wish to tell us?

663
00:52:24,006 --> 00:52:26,907
Don't be in such a hurry.
You have all the time in the world.

664
00:52:27,076 --> 00:52:29,738
You may be in Casablanca indefinitely.

665
00:52:29,912 --> 00:52:31,846
Or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow.

666
00:52:32,014 --> 00:52:34,209
- On one condition.
- And that is?

667
00:52:34,483 --> 00:52:37,680
You know the leader of the underground
movement in Paris, in Prague...

668
00:52:37,887 --> 00:52:39,218
...Brussels, Amsterdam...

669
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:41,686
...Oslo, Belgrade, Athens...

670
00:52:41,891 --> 00:52:44,451
- Even Berlin.
- Yes, even in Berlin.

671
00:52:44,627 --> 00:52:47,255
If you will furnish me with their names
and whereabouts...

672
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,193
...you'll have your visa in the morning.

673
00:52:49,465 --> 00:52:52,127
And the honor of having served
the Third Reich.

674
00:52:52,835 --> 00:52:55,030
I was in a German concentration camp
for a year.

675
00:52:55,538 --> 00:52:58,974
- That's honor enough for a lifetime.
- You will give us the names?

676
00:53:00,509 --> 00:53:03,034
If I didn't give them to you
in a concentration camp...

677
00:53:03,245 --> 00:53:06,146
...where you had more persuasive methods
at your disposal...

678
00:53:06,348 --> 00:53:08,942
...I certainly won't give them to you now.

679
00:53:09,418 --> 00:53:11,784
And what if you track down
these men and kill them?

680
00:53:11,987 --> 00:53:13,511
What if you murdered all of us?

681
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:18,057
From every corner of Europe, hundreds,
thousands would rise to take our places.

682
00:53:18,227 --> 00:53:20,559
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.

683
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:24,257
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for
eloquence which I can now understand.

684
00:53:24,433 --> 00:53:26,025
But in one aspect you are mistaken.

685
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:28,762
You said the enemies
of the Reich could all be replaced.

686
00:53:28,938 --> 00:53:30,462
But there is one exception.

687
00:53:30,673 --> 00:53:33,267
No one could take your place
if anything unfortunate...

688
00:53:33,442 --> 00:53:36,343
...should occur to you
while you were trying to escape.

689
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:39,044
You won't dare to interfere with me here.

690
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:40,773
This is still unoccupied France.

691
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:44,083
Any violation of neutrality
would reflect on Captain Renault.

692
00:53:44,253 --> 00:53:46,949
- Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power.
- Thank you.

693
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:51,219
By the way, monsieur, last night
you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.

694
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:55,729
I believe you have a message for him?

695
00:53:55,898 --> 00:53:58,162
Nothing important.
But may I speak to him now?

696
00:53:58,701 --> 00:54:01,727
You would find the conversation
a trifle one-sided.

697
00:54:01,904 --> 00:54:03,769
Signor Ugarte is dead.

698
00:54:10,377 --> 00:54:11,867
I'm making out the report now.

699
00:54:12,045 --> 00:54:14,639
We haven't quite decided
whether he committed suicide...

700
00:54:15,315 --> 00:54:17,180
...or died trying to escape.

701
00:54:18,818 --> 00:54:21,514
- Are you quite finished with us?
- For the time being.

702
00:54:21,721 --> 00:54:23,211
Good day.

703
00:54:27,627 --> 00:54:30,255
Undoubtedly, their next step will
be to the black market.

704
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:31,454
Excuse me, captain.

705
00:54:31,665 --> 00:54:34,657
Another visa problem has come up.

706
00:54:35,135 --> 00:54:38,036
- Show her in.
- Yes, sir.

707
00:54:46,713 --> 00:54:49,739
Sorry, monsieur, we were never
to handle the police.

708
00:54:49,916 --> 00:54:52,680
- This is a job for Signor Ferrari.
- Ferrari?

709
00:54:52,852 --> 00:54:55,047
It can be most helpful
to know Signor Ferrari.

710
00:54:55,221 --> 00:54:57,849
He pretty near has a monopoly
on the black market here.

711
00:54:58,058 --> 00:55:00,117
You will find him at the Blue Parrot.

712
00:55:00,827 --> 00:55:02,454
Thanks.

713
00:55:14,307 --> 00:55:15,706
Don't be too downhearted.

714
00:55:15,909 --> 00:55:17,968
Perhaps you can come to terms with Renault.

715
00:55:18,144 --> 00:55:19,475
Thank you very much, signor.

716
00:55:19,646 --> 00:55:22,080
- Hello, Ferrari.
- Good morning, Rick.

717
00:55:22,248 --> 00:55:24,409
The bus is in.
I'll take my shipment with me.

718
00:55:24,617 --> 00:55:26,642
I'll have it sent over.
Have a drink with me.

719
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:31,052
I never drink in the morning. And every time
you send my shipment over it's a little short.

720
00:55:31,224 --> 00:55:33,192
Carrying charges, my boy.
Carrying charges.

721
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:34,656
Here, sit down.

722
00:55:34,861 --> 00:55:37,489
There is something I want
to talk over with you, anyhow.

723
00:55:37,664 --> 00:55:39,291
Bourbon.

724
00:55:39,566 --> 00:55:41,500
The news about Ugarte
upsets me very much.

725
00:55:41,668 --> 00:55:44,865
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel
any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.

726
00:55:45,271 --> 00:55:48,069
Of course not. What upsets me
is that Ugarte is dead...

727
00:55:48,241 --> 00:55:50,266
...and no one knows where
those letters are.

728
00:55:50,443 --> 00:55:51,740
Practically no one.

729
00:55:51,945 --> 00:55:54,209
If I had those letters,
I could make a fortune.

730
00:55:54,481 --> 00:55:56,540
So could I,
and I'm a poor businessman.

731
00:55:56,750 --> 00:56:00,584
I have a proposition for whoever has those
letters. I'll handle the entire transaction.

732
00:56:00,754 --> 00:56:03,621
Get rid of the letters, take all the risk,
for a small percentage.

733
00:56:03,823 --> 00:56:05,313
And the carrying charges?

734
00:56:05,492 --> 00:56:08,256
Naturally there will be a few
incidental expenses.

735
00:56:08,962 --> 00:56:11,362
That's my proposition
for whoever has those letters.

736
00:56:11,531 --> 00:56:13,089
I'll tell him when he comes in.

737
00:56:13,266 --> 00:56:15,894
Rick, I think you know
where those letters are.

738
00:56:16,169 --> 00:56:19,366
You're in good company.
Renault and Strasser probably think so too.

739
00:56:25,078 --> 00:56:28,104
That's why I came here. To give
them a chance to ransack my place.

740
00:56:28,281 --> 00:56:31,614
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into
your confidence. You need a partner.

741
00:56:31,785 --> 00:56:33,719
Excuse me, I'll be getting back.

742
00:56:37,323 --> 00:56:41,054
- Morning.
- Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.

743
00:56:45,732 --> 00:56:48,360
You will not find a treasure like this
in all Morocco.

744
00:56:48,568 --> 00:56:49,865
Only 700 francs.

745
00:56:50,069 --> 00:56:53,232
- You're being cheated.
- Doesn't matter, thank you.

746
00:56:53,406 --> 00:56:56,534
For friends of Rick's
we have a small discount.

747
00:56:56,743 --> 00:56:59,268
Did I say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.

748
00:56:59,445 --> 00:57:03,108
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you
when you called on me last night.

749
00:57:03,283 --> 00:57:04,272
Doesn't matter.

750
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:08,386
For special friends of Rick's
we have a special discount. 100 francs.

751
00:57:08,555 --> 00:57:11,581
Your story had me a little confused.
Or maybe it was the bourbon.

752
00:57:11,791 --> 00:57:13,383
I have some tablecloths, napkins--

753
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:16,256
- Thank you. I'm really not interested.
- Please, one minute.

754
00:57:16,429 --> 00:57:20,058
Why did you come back? To tell me why you
ran out on me at the railway station?

755
00:57:20,233 --> 00:57:21,257
Yes.

756
00:57:21,434 --> 00:57:23,800
Well, you can tell me now.
I'm reasonably sober.

757
00:57:24,037 --> 00:57:25,561
I don't think I will, Rick.

758
00:57:25,738 --> 00:57:30,038
Why not? After all, I got stuck with
a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.

759
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:32,405
Last night I saw
what has happened to you.

760
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:36,310
The Rick I knew in Paris,
I could tell him, he'd understand.

761
00:57:36,482 --> 00:57:39,042
But the one who looked at me
with such hatred...

762
00:57:40,587 --> 00:57:43,613
I'll be leaving Casablanca soon.
We'll never see each other again.

763
00:57:44,757 --> 00:57:48,818
We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris.

764
00:57:48,995 --> 00:57:53,796
If we leave it that way, maybe we'll
remember those days and not Casablanca.

765
00:57:54,267 --> 00:57:55,393
Not last night.

766
00:57:56,069 --> 00:57:59,300
Did you run out on me because
you knew what it would be like?

767
00:57:59,472 --> 00:58:02,373
Hiding from the police,
running away all the time?

768
00:58:02,542 --> 00:58:04,237
You can believe that if you want to.

769
00:58:04,444 --> 00:58:07,174
Well, I'm not running away anymore.
I'm settled now.

770
00:58:07,347 --> 00:58:09,144
Above a saloon, it's true...

771
00:58:09,349 --> 00:58:10,782
...but walk up a flight...

772
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:12,679
...I'll be expecting you.

773
00:58:14,754 --> 00:58:17,552
All the same,
someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

774
00:58:17,724 --> 00:58:19,453
You'll be there.

775
00:58:20,994 --> 00:58:22,018
No, Rick.

776
00:58:23,429 --> 00:58:25,693
No. You see, Victor Laszlo
is my husband.

777
00:58:26,733 --> 00:58:30,294
And was,
even when I knew you in Paris.

778
00:58:34,874 --> 00:58:39,436
I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo
that unfortunately I'm not able to help him.

779
00:58:39,612 --> 00:58:41,512
You see, my dear, word has gone around.

780
00:58:41,714 --> 00:58:46,276
As leader of all illegal activities in
Casablanca, I am influential and respected.

781
00:58:46,452 --> 00:58:49,888
But it would not be worth my life
to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.

782
00:58:50,056 --> 00:58:51,887
You, however, are a different matter.

783
00:58:52,325 --> 00:58:56,694
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible
to get an exit visa for you.

784
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:00,258
- You mean for me to go on alone?
- And only alone.

785
00:59:00,466 --> 00:59:03,731
I'll stay here and keep on trying.
I'm sure in a little while--

786
00:59:03,903 --> 00:59:05,700
Might as well be frank, monsieur.

787
00:59:05,872 --> 00:59:09,330
It would take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

788
00:59:09,809 --> 00:59:11,936
We are only interested in two visas.

789
00:59:12,111 --> 00:59:14,375
- Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
- No, Victor.

790
00:59:14,714 --> 00:59:16,807
You two will want to discuss this.

791
00:59:16,983 --> 00:59:18,951
Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.

792
00:59:22,822 --> 00:59:24,619
No, Ilsa.
I won't let you stay here.

793
00:59:24,791 --> 00:59:28,158
You must get to America. Believe me,
somehow I will get out and join you.

794
00:59:28,394 --> 00:59:30,191
But if the situation were different...

795
00:59:30,363 --> 00:59:32,923
...if I had to stay
and there were only visa for one...

796
00:59:33,099 --> 00:59:34,396
...would you take it?

797
00:59:35,601 --> 00:59:36,693
Yes, I would.

798
00:59:37,904 --> 00:59:39,098
Yes, I see.

799
00:59:40,273 --> 00:59:44,175
When I had trouble getting out of Lille,
why didn't you leave me there?

800
00:59:44,344 --> 00:59:48,405
When I was sick in Marseilles for two weeks
and you were in danger every minute...

801
00:59:48,581 --> 00:59:50,378
...why didn't you leave me then?

802
00:59:51,684 --> 00:59:54,175
I meant to,
but something always held me up.

803
00:59:56,656 --> 00:59:58,123
I love you very much, Ilsa.

804
00:59:59,325 --> 01:00:01,418
Your secret will be safe with me.

805
01:00:02,495 --> 01:00:04,588
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

806
01:00:04,764 --> 01:00:07,096
Not more than 50 francs.

807
01:00:11,838 --> 01:00:13,635
We've decided, Signor Ferrari.

808
01:00:13,806 --> 01:00:17,173
For the present we will go on looking
for two visas. Thank you very much.

809
01:00:17,343 --> 01:00:19,311
Well, good luck, but be careful.

810
01:00:19,479 --> 01:00:22,312
- You know you're being shadowed?
- Of course. It becomes an instinct.

811
01:00:22,648 --> 01:00:25,674
I observe that you, in one respect,
are a very fortunate man.

812
01:00:25,885 --> 01:00:28,581
I am moved to make one more suggestion.
Why, I do not know.

813
01:00:28,755 --> 01:00:30,655
Because it cannot possibly profit me.

814
01:00:30,857 --> 01:00:34,020
Have you heard about Ugarte
and the letters of transit?

815
01:00:34,193 --> 01:00:35,182
Yes, something.

816
01:00:35,361 --> 01:00:38,558
Those letters were not found on Ugarte
when they arrested him.

817
01:00:38,731 --> 01:00:40,722
- You know where they are?
- Not for sure.

818
01:00:40,933 --> 01:00:43,959
But I'd guess that Ugarte
left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

819
01:00:45,872 --> 01:00:49,069
A difficult customer, that Rick.
One never knows what he'll do or why.

820
01:00:49,275 --> 01:00:50,902
But it is worth a chance.

821
01:00:51,477 --> 01:00:54,275
Thank you very much.
Good day.

822
01:00:54,514 --> 01:00:58,211
Goodbye. Thank you for your coffee.
I shall miss that when we leave Casablanca.

823
01:00:58,384 --> 01:01:01,251
Gracious of you to share it with me.
Good day, mademoiselle.

824
01:01:01,421 --> 01:01:03,855
- Monsieur.
- Good day.

825
01:01:13,266 --> 01:01:14,893
- Here's to you, sir.
- Good luck.

826
01:01:15,401 --> 01:01:17,232
- I'd better be going.
- My check, please.

827
01:01:17,437 --> 01:01:21,168
I have to warn you, sir.
This is a dangerous place. Full of vultures.

828
01:01:21,374 --> 01:01:24,207
- Vultures everywhere. Thanks for everything.
- Goodbye.

829
01:01:24,377 --> 01:01:26,004
It has been a pleasure to meet you.

830
01:01:26,179 --> 01:01:27,840
I'm sorry.

831
01:01:43,696 --> 01:01:47,393
Monsieur Rick,
you are getting to be your best customer.

832
01:01:49,435 --> 01:01:51,801
Well, drinking.
I'm very pleased with you.

833
01:01:51,971 --> 01:01:53,871
You're beginning
to live like a Frenchman.

834
01:01:54,073 --> 01:01:56,405
That was some going-over
your men gave my place.

835
01:01:56,576 --> 01:01:58,567
We barely got cleaned up
in time to open.

836
01:01:58,744 --> 01:02:01,008
I told Strasser he wouldn't
find the letters here.

837
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:03,307
But I told my men
to be especially destructive.

838
01:02:03,483 --> 01:02:05,417
You know how
that impresses Germans.

839
01:02:06,752 --> 01:02:09,050
Rick, have you got
those letters of transit?

840
01:02:09,422 --> 01:02:11,515
Louis, are you Pro-Vichy
or Free French?

841
01:02:12,158 --> 01:02:16,618
Serves me right for asking a direct question.
The subject is closed.

842
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:19,394
It looks like you're a little late.

843
01:02:26,706 --> 01:02:28,367
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

844
01:02:28,541 --> 01:02:32,307
Who knows? In her own way,
she may constitute an entire second front.

845
01:02:32,712 --> 01:02:36,204
I think it's time for me to flatter
Strasser a little. I'll see you later.

846
01:02:37,049 --> 01:02:38,482
Sascha!

847
01:02:38,651 --> 01:02:39,675
French 75s.

848
01:02:39,886 --> 01:02:43,549
Put up a whole row of them, Sascha.
Starting here and ending here.

849
01:02:43,723 --> 01:02:45,054
We will begin with two.

850
01:02:54,133 --> 01:02:56,328
What did you say?
Would you kindly repeat it?

851
01:02:56,536 --> 01:02:59,903
- What I said is none of your business.
- I'll make it my business.

852
01:03:06,078 --> 01:03:09,741
I don't like disturbances in my place.
Either lay off politics or get out.

853
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,678
You see, captain?

854
01:03:15,922 --> 01:03:18,322
The situation is not as under control
as you believe.

855
01:03:18,524 --> 01:03:20,389
We try to cooperate
with your government.

856
01:03:20,593 --> 01:03:22,857
But we cannot regulate
the feelings of our people.

857
01:03:23,029 --> 01:03:25,190
Captain, are you certain
which side you're on?

858
01:03:25,498 --> 01:03:27,659
I have no conviction,
if that's what you mean.

859
01:03:27,867 --> 01:03:29,164
I blow with the wind...

860
01:03:29,335 --> 01:03:31,735
...and the prevailing wind
happens to be from Vichy.

861
01:03:31,938 --> 01:03:33,633
And if it should change?

862
01:03:33,906 --> 01:03:36,067
Surely the Reich doesn't admit
that possibility?

863
01:03:36,242 --> 01:03:38,335
We are concerned
about more than Casablanca.

864
01:03:38,544 --> 01:03:41,945
We know that every French province
in Africa is honeycombed with traitors.

865
01:03:42,448 --> 01:03:45,144
Waiting for their chance.
Waiting perhaps for a leader.

866
01:03:45,318 --> 01:03:46,876
A leader? Like Laszlo?

867
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,851
I have been thinking.

868
01:03:49,188 --> 01:03:52,487
It's too dangerous to let him go,
it may be too dangerous to let him stay.

869
01:03:52,658 --> 01:03:53,647
I see what you mean.

870
01:03:59,565 --> 01:04:01,430
Thank you, Carl.

871
01:04:01,634 --> 01:04:03,864
Thank you, Carl.

872
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:06,004
Sit down. Have a brandy with us.

873
01:04:06,339 --> 01:04:08,773
To celebrate our leaving
for America tomorrow.

874
01:04:08,941 --> 01:04:10,033
Thank you very much.

875
01:04:10,243 --> 01:04:12,973
I thought you would ask me,
so I brought the good brandy...

876
01:04:13,179 --> 01:04:15,010
...and a third glass.

877
01:04:15,181 --> 01:04:17,172
At last the day's came!

878
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:20,183
Frau Leuchtag and I
are speaking nothing but English now.

879
01:04:20,353 --> 01:04:23,220
So we should feel at home
when we get to America.

880
01:04:23,389 --> 01:04:25,050
A very nice idea.

881
01:04:25,391 --> 01:04:26,619
To America.

882
01:04:27,393 --> 01:04:28,382
To America.

883
01:04:35,968 --> 01:04:37,367
What watch?

884
01:04:38,237 --> 01:04:41,229
- Ten watch.
- Such much?

885
01:04:42,875 --> 01:04:45,207
You will get along beautifully in America.

886
01:04:46,212 --> 01:04:47,975
How is lady luck treating you?

887
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:50,011
Oh, too bad.

888
01:04:50,349 --> 01:04:52,214
You'll find him over there.

889
01:04:58,457 --> 01:04:59,981
- Monsieur Rick?
- Yes?

890
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:03,390
- Could I speak to you, please?
- How'd you get in here? You're underage.

891
01:05:03,562 --> 01:05:05,894
- I came with Captain Renault.
- I should have known.

892
01:05:06,065 --> 01:05:07,396
My husband is with me too.

893
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,330
He is? Captain Renault's getting
broad-minded. Sit down.

894
01:05:10,503 --> 01:05:11,492
Have a drink?

895
01:05:11,671 --> 01:05:14,367
No, of course not. You mind if I do?

896
01:05:14,974 --> 01:05:16,032
Monsieur Rick...

897
01:05:16,742 --> 01:05:20,337
- ...what kind of a man is Captain Renault?
- Like any other man, only more so.

898
01:05:20,513 --> 01:05:21,502
No, I mean...

899
01:05:21,847 --> 01:05:23,508
...is he trustworthy?
Is his word--?

900
01:05:23,883 --> 01:05:27,819
- Just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
- He did. Captain Renault did.

901
01:05:27,987 --> 01:05:30,046
I thought so. Where's your husband?

902
01:05:30,323 --> 01:05:34,589
At the roulette table,
trying to win enough for our exit visas.

903
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,557
Oh, of course he's losing.

904
01:05:36,796 --> 01:05:39,697
- How long have you been married?
- Eight weeks.

905
01:05:40,733 --> 01:05:42,360
We come from Bulgaria.

906
01:05:42,968 --> 01:05:45,198
Things are very bad there.

907
01:05:45,371 --> 01:05:47,566
The devil has the people
by the throat.

908
01:05:47,973 --> 01:05:50,498
So Jan and I, we...

909
01:05:50,676 --> 01:05:53,372
We do not want our children
to grow up in such a country.

910
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:55,945
- So you decided to go to America.
- Yes.

911
01:05:56,115 --> 01:05:58,515
But we haven't much money...

912
01:05:58,684 --> 01:06:01,152
...and traveling is so expensive
and difficult.

913
01:06:01,554 --> 01:06:03,579
It was much more than we thought
to get here.

914
01:06:04,256 --> 01:06:06,121
And then Captain Renault sees us...

915
01:06:06,325 --> 01:06:09,294
- ...and he is so kind, he wants to help us.
- Yes, I'll bet.

916
01:06:09,595 --> 01:06:12,655
He tells me he can give us an exit visa.

917
01:06:13,065 --> 01:06:14,464
But we have no money.

918
01:06:14,767 --> 01:06:16,359
- Does he know that?
- Yes.

919
01:06:16,535 --> 01:06:18,867
- And he's still willing to give you a visa?
- Yes.

920
01:06:19,038 --> 01:06:22,007
- And you want to know...?
- Will he keep his word?

921
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:24,201
He always has.

922
01:06:29,382 --> 01:06:31,407
You are a man.

923
01:06:31,584 --> 01:06:34,246
If someone loved you very much...

924
01:06:34,453 --> 01:06:38,685
...so that your happiness was the only thing
that she wanted in the world...

925
01:06:39,258 --> 01:06:42,125
...and she did a bad thing
to make certain of it...

926
01:06:42,628 --> 01:06:45,722
- ...could you forgive her?
- Nobody ever loved me that much.

927
01:06:45,898 --> 01:06:49,732
And he never knew, and the girl kept
this bad thing locked in her heart...

928
01:06:49,902 --> 01:06:51,699
...that would be all right,
wouldn't it?

929
01:06:51,871 --> 01:06:53,998
- You want my advice?
- Yes, please.

930
01:06:54,507 --> 01:06:55,599
Go back to Bulgaria.

931
01:06:55,841 --> 01:07:00,073
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us
to leave Europe, to get to America...

932
01:07:01,313 --> 01:07:05,409
Oh, but if Jan should find out.
He is such a boy.

933
01:07:05,584 --> 01:07:09,020
In many ways
I am so much older than he is.

934
01:07:09,188 --> 01:07:11,588
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca
has problems.

935
01:07:11,791 --> 01:07:14,919
- Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
- Thank you, monsieur.

936
01:07:23,636 --> 01:07:24,933
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

937
01:07:25,104 --> 01:07:28,631
- You see? Here we are again.
- I take that as a great compliment to Sam.

938
01:07:28,808 --> 01:07:32,039
I suppose he means to you
Paris of happier days.

939
01:07:32,611 --> 01:07:35,774
He does. Could we
have a table close to him?

940
01:07:35,981 --> 01:07:38,313
And as far away
from Major Strasser as possible.

941
01:07:38,651 --> 01:07:41,142
The geography may be
a little difficult to arrange.

942
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,083
- Paul, table 30.
- Yes, sir.

943
01:07:43,255 --> 01:07:45,052
Right this way, if you please.

944
01:07:45,224 --> 01:07:48,990
I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By."
I believe that's your favorite tune.

945
01:07:49,228 --> 01:07:50,490
Thank you.

946
01:07:59,905 --> 01:08:02,533
- Two cognacs, please.
- Cognac.

947
01:08:25,631 --> 01:08:28,191
Do you wish to place another bet, sir?

948
01:08:28,734 --> 01:08:30,463
No. No, I guess not.

949
01:08:30,636 --> 01:08:32,501
Have you tried 22 tonight?

950
01:08:34,073 --> 01:08:35,472
I said 22.

951
01:08:51,824 --> 01:08:53,155
Leave it there.

952
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:10,005
Cash it in and don't come back.

953
01:09:12,778 --> 01:09:14,769
Are you sure this place is honest?

954
01:09:15,347 --> 01:09:19,181
Honest? As honest as the day is long.

955
01:09:22,121 --> 01:09:23,452
How are we doing tonight?

956
01:09:23,789 --> 01:09:26,451
A couple of thousand less
than I thought there would be.

957
01:09:30,162 --> 01:09:32,130
Monsieur Rick...

958
01:09:37,169 --> 01:09:38,796
He's just a lucky guy.

959
01:09:41,507 --> 01:09:44,408
Monsieur Rick,
may I get you a cup of coffee?

960
01:09:44,577 --> 01:09:46,636
- No, thanks, Carl.
- Monsieur Rick...

961
01:09:50,149 --> 01:09:51,639
Captain Renault, may I--?

962
01:09:51,817 --> 01:09:55,776
Not here. Come to my office in the morning.
We'll do everything businesslike.

963
01:09:55,955 --> 01:09:58,685
- We'll be there at 6.
- I'll be there at 10.

964
01:09:58,857 --> 01:10:00,722
I'm very happy for both of you.

965
01:10:00,893 --> 01:10:02,986
Still, it's very strange that you won.

966
01:10:03,162 --> 01:10:05,426
Well, maybe not so strange.

967
01:10:05,598 --> 01:10:08,431
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Thank you, Captain Renault.

968
01:10:08,834 --> 01:10:10,426
No!

969
01:10:16,141 --> 01:10:19,042
Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.

970
01:10:19,812 --> 01:10:22,246
Go away, you crazy Russian.

971
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:35,957
- As I suspected. You're a rank sentimentalist.
- Yeah? Why?

972
01:10:36,128 --> 01:10:38,323
Why do you interfere
with my little romances?

973
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:40,361
Put it down as a gesture to love.

974
01:10:40,532 --> 01:10:42,056
Well, I'll forgive you this time.

975
01:10:42,267 --> 01:10:45,100
But I'll be in tomorrow night
with a breathtaking blond.

976
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:47,465
And it'll make me very happy if she loses.

977
01:10:51,543 --> 01:10:54,671
- Mr. Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you.
- Go ahead.

978
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,472
Well, isn't there some other place?

979
01:10:56,682 --> 01:10:59,173
It's rather confidential,
what I have to say.

980
01:11:01,153 --> 01:11:03,383
- In my office.
- Right.

981
01:11:04,456 --> 01:11:07,118
You must know it's very important
I get out of Casablanca.

982
01:11:07,292 --> 01:11:10,284
It's my privilege to be one of the leaders
of a great movement.

983
01:11:10,462 --> 01:11:12,225
You know what I've been doing.

984
01:11:12,398 --> 01:11:16,334
You know what it means to the work,
to the lives of thousands of people...

985
01:11:16,502 --> 01:11:18,766
...that I reach America
and continue my work.

986
01:11:18,937 --> 01:11:20,370
I'm not interested in politics.

987
01:11:20,539 --> 01:11:23,030
The problems of the world
are not in my department.

988
01:11:23,308 --> 01:11:24,400
I'm a saloonkeeper.

989
01:11:24,743 --> 01:11:28,304
My friends in the underground tell me
that you have quite a record.

990
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,004
You ran guns to Ethiopia.

991
01:11:30,182 --> 01:11:33,049
- You fought against the fascists in Spain.
- What of it?

992
01:11:33,218 --> 01:11:36,381
Isn't it strange you're always
fighting on the side of the underdog?

993
01:11:36,588 --> 01:11:38,522
Yes, I found that a very expensive hobby.

994
01:11:38,724 --> 01:11:40,954
But then I never was
much of a businessman.

995
01:11:41,126 --> 01:11:44,493
Are you enough of a businessman
to appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs?

996
01:11:44,663 --> 01:11:47,530
- I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
- 200,000.

997
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:50,425
My friend, you could make it
a million francs or three.

998
01:11:50,636 --> 01:11:52,433
My answer would still be the same.

999
01:11:52,604 --> 01:11:54,765
There must be some reason
why you won't let me.

1000
01:11:54,973 --> 01:11:56,099
There is.

1001
01:11:56,575 --> 01:11:58,702
I suggest that you ask your wife.

1002
01:11:59,011 --> 01:12:01,639
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, ask your wife.

1003
01:12:02,014 --> 01:12:04,414
- My wife?
- Yes.

1004
01:12:44,823 --> 01:12:46,814
Play "La Marseillaise."
Play it!

1005
01:14:02,868 --> 01:14:06,861
See what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in
a café can inspire this demonstration...

1006
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:09,507
...what more will his presence
in Casablanca bring on?

1007
01:14:09,675 --> 01:14:11,666
I advise that this place
be shut up at once.

1008
01:14:11,944 --> 01:14:14,913
- But everybody's having a good time.
- Yes, much too good a time.

1009
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,274
The place is to be closed.

1010
01:14:16,448 --> 01:14:19,508
- But I have no excuse to close it.
- Find one.

1011
01:14:24,423 --> 01:14:26,050
Everybody is to leave immediately.

1012
01:14:26,291 --> 01:14:28,521
This café is closed until further notice.

1013
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,352
Clear the room at once.

1014
01:14:33,799 --> 01:14:35,164
How can you close me up?

1015
01:14:35,367 --> 01:14:38,825
I'm shocked, shocked to find that
gambling is going on in here.

1016
01:14:39,004 --> 01:14:40,904
- Your winnings, sir.
- Thank you.

1017
01:14:41,073 --> 01:14:42,335
Everybody out at once.

1018
01:14:46,778 --> 01:14:50,714
After this disturbance it is not safe
for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

1019
01:14:50,883 --> 01:14:53,681
This morning you implied it wasn't safe
to leave Casablanca.

1020
01:14:53,852 --> 01:14:56,787
That is also true, except for one destination:
occupied France.

1021
01:14:56,989 --> 01:14:59,890
- Occupied France?
- Under safe conduct from me.

1022
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:01,114
Of what value is that?

1023
01:15:01,293 --> 01:15:04,319
You may recall what German guarantees
have been worth in the past.

1024
01:15:04,496 --> 01:15:07,761
- There are two other alternatives for him.
- What are they?

1025
01:15:07,933 --> 01:15:12,233
The French authorities may find a reason
to put him in the concentration camp here.

1026
01:15:12,404 --> 01:15:13,496
The other alternative?

1027
01:15:13,672 --> 01:15:18,439
My dear, perhaps you have already observed
that in Casablanca human life is cheap.

1028
01:15:18,610 --> 01:15:19,941
Good night, mademoiselle.

1029
01:15:30,656 --> 01:15:34,148
- What happened with Rick?
- We'll discuss it later.

1030
01:15:57,082 --> 01:15:59,073
Our faithful friend is still there.

1031
01:15:59,618 --> 01:16:02,143
Please don't go
to the underground meeting tonight.

1032
01:16:02,387 --> 01:16:03,479
I must.

1033
01:16:03,655 --> 01:16:07,113
Besides, it isn't often that a man gets
to display heroics before his wife.

1034
01:16:07,292 --> 01:16:10,625
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's
warning tonight, I'm frightened.

1035
01:16:10,829 --> 01:16:12,660
Tell you the truth,
I'm frightened too.

1036
01:16:12,831 --> 01:16:15,265
Shall I remain here
in a hotel room, hiding?

1037
01:16:15,467 --> 01:16:17,094
Or shall I carry on the best I can?

1038
01:16:17,502 --> 01:16:20,164
Whatever I'd say,
you would carry on.

1039
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:23,974
Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick?
What did you find out?

1040
01:16:24,142 --> 01:16:26,508
- Apparently he has the letters.
- Yes?

1041
01:16:26,678 --> 01:16:28,236
But no intention of selling them.

1042
01:16:28,413 --> 01:16:32,110
You'd think if sentiment
wouldn't persuade him, money would.

1043
01:16:32,284 --> 01:16:33,842
Did he give any reason?

1044
01:16:34,052 --> 01:16:37,317
- He suggested I ask you.
- Ask me?

1045
01:16:37,522 --> 01:16:39,683
Yes, he said, "Ask your wife."

1046
01:16:40,659 --> 01:16:42,422
I don't know why he said that.

1047
01:16:54,973 --> 01:16:57,703
Well, our friend outside will think
we've retired by now.

1048
01:16:59,077 --> 01:17:00,908
I'll be going in a few minutes.

1049
01:17:02,981 --> 01:17:05,472
- Ilsa, I...
- Yes?

1050
01:17:06,752 --> 01:17:09,016
When I was in the concentration camp...

1051
01:17:09,588 --> 01:17:12,113
...were you lonely in Paris?

1052
01:17:13,592 --> 01:17:15,583
Yes, Victor, I was.

1053
01:17:16,561 --> 01:17:19,530
I know how it is to be lonely.

1054
01:17:20,599 --> 01:17:22,931
Is there anything you wish to tell me?

1055
01:17:24,936 --> 01:17:26,927
No, Victor, there isn't.

1056
01:17:31,576 --> 01:17:34,101
I love you very much, my dear.

1057
01:17:37,449 --> 01:17:39,440
Yes, I know.

1058
01:17:40,285 --> 01:17:42,719
Victor, whatever I do,
will you believe that I...?

1059
01:17:42,888 --> 01:17:45,584
You don't even have to say it.

1060
01:17:45,757 --> 01:17:47,520
I'll believe.

1061
01:17:49,628 --> 01:17:50,959
Good night, dear.

1062
01:17:52,964 --> 01:17:54,295
Good night.

1063
01:18:01,339 --> 01:18:04,001
- Victor.
- Yes, dear?

1064
01:18:09,314 --> 01:18:10,679
Be careful.

1065
01:18:12,284 --> 01:18:13,842
Of course I'll be careful.

1066
01:18:57,195 --> 01:19:00,392
Well, you are in
pretty good shape, Herr Rick.

1067
01:19:00,565 --> 01:19:02,362
How long can I afford to stay closed?

1068
01:19:03,034 --> 01:19:04,331
Two weeks, maybe three.

1069
01:19:04,536 --> 01:19:06,766
Maybe I won't have to.
A bribe has worked before.

1070
01:19:06,972 --> 01:19:09,202
In the meantime,
everybody stays on salary.

1071
01:19:09,374 --> 01:19:10,739
Thank you, Herr Rick.

1072
01:19:10,909 --> 01:19:14,276
Sascha will be happy to hear it.
I owe him money.

1073
01:19:14,846 --> 01:19:17,679
- You finish locking up, will you, Carl?
- I will.

1074
01:19:17,849 --> 01:19:20,977
- Then I am going to the meeting--
- Don't tell me where you're going.

1075
01:19:21,153 --> 01:19:22,347
I won't.

1076
01:19:23,522 --> 01:19:24,580
Good night.

1077
01:19:25,724 --> 01:19:27,316
Good night, Mr. Rick.

1078
01:19:43,975 --> 01:19:47,376
- How did you get in?
- The stairs from the street.

1079
01:19:47,546 --> 01:19:50,879
I told you this morning you'd come around,
but this is ahead of schedule.

1080
01:19:51,049 --> 01:19:52,277
Well, won't you sit down?

1081
01:19:52,484 --> 01:19:56,386
- Richard, I had to see you.
- "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.

1082
01:19:56,555 --> 01:19:59,854
Your visit isn't connected
by any chance with the letters of transit?

1083
01:20:00,058 --> 01:20:02,754
Seems as long as I have those letters
I'll never be lonely.

1084
01:20:02,928 --> 01:20:05,556
Ask any price you want,
but you must give me the letters.

1085
01:20:05,730 --> 01:20:08,290
I went all through that
with your husband. It's no deal.

1086
01:20:08,867 --> 01:20:10,596
I know how you feel about me...

1087
01:20:10,769 --> 01:20:13,533
...but put your feelings aside
for something more important.

1088
01:20:13,705 --> 01:20:16,173
I have to hear again
what a great man your husband is...

1089
01:20:16,341 --> 01:20:18,332
...what an important cause
he's fighting for?

1090
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:19,841
It was your cause too.

1091
01:20:20,045 --> 01:20:22,513
In your own way, you were fighting
for the same thing.

1092
01:20:22,948 --> 01:20:25,644
I'm not fighting for anything
anymore except myself.

1093
01:20:25,884 --> 01:20:27,875
I'm the only cause I'm interested in.

1094
01:20:34,459 --> 01:20:37,986
We loved each other once.
If those days meant anything at all to you--

1095
01:20:38,163 --> 01:20:41,098
I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you.
It's poor salesmanship.

1096
01:20:41,266 --> 01:20:44,724
Listen to me. If you knew what really
happened, if you only knew the truth--

1097
01:20:44,903 --> 01:20:46,962
I wouldn't believe you
no matter what you said.

1098
01:20:47,138 --> 01:20:50,164
You'd say anything now
to get what you want.

1099
01:20:54,412 --> 01:20:57,142
You want to feel sorry for yourself,
don't you?

1100
01:20:57,315 --> 01:21:00,079
With so much at stake
all you can think of is your feelings.

1101
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:04,815
One woman has hurt you, and you
take your revenge on the rest of the world.

1102
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:07,515
You're a coward and a weakling.

1103
01:21:10,929 --> 01:21:13,796
No. Oh, Richard. I'm sorry.

1104
01:21:14,866 --> 01:21:17,835
I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.

1105
01:21:18,003 --> 01:21:20,699
If you don't help us,
Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

1106
01:21:20,939 --> 01:21:21,928
What of it?

1107
01:21:22,107 --> 01:21:24,769
I'm going to die in Casablanca.
It's a good spot for it.

1108
01:21:31,616 --> 01:21:33,447
Now, if you'll--

1109
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:37,117
All right.

1110
01:21:37,289 --> 01:21:39,314
I tried to reason with you.

1111
01:21:39,491 --> 01:21:41,721
I tried everything.
Now, I want those letters.

1112
01:21:42,127 --> 01:21:45,255
- Get them for me.
- I don't have to. I got them right here.

1113
01:21:46,831 --> 01:21:48,696
Put them on the table.

1114
01:21:50,602 --> 01:21:51,591
No.

1115
01:21:52,704 --> 01:21:54,797
For the last time,
put them on the table.

1116
01:21:56,107 --> 01:22:00,100
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you, you won't stop at anything.

1117
01:22:01,513 --> 01:22:03,504
All right,
I'll make it easier for you.

1118
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:09,647
Go ahead and shoot.
You'll be doing me a favor.

1119
01:22:14,559 --> 01:22:16,459
Richard...

1120
01:22:16,628 --> 01:22:18,994
...I tried to stay away.

1121
01:22:19,364 --> 01:22:22,026
I thought I would never see you again.

1122
01:22:23,168 --> 01:22:25,636
That you were out of my life.

1123
01:22:45,890 --> 01:22:47,915
The day you left Paris...

1124
01:22:49,494 --> 01:22:51,485
...if you knew what I went through.

1125
01:22:53,164 --> 01:22:55,826
If you knew how much I loved you.

1126
01:22:56,835 --> 01:22:59,668
How much I still love you.

1127
01:23:13,551 --> 01:23:14,575
And then?

1128
01:23:16,621 --> 01:23:20,955
It wasn't long after we were married
that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

1129
01:23:21,126 --> 01:23:24,653
They needed him in Prague,
but there the Gestapo were waiting for him.

1130
01:23:24,829 --> 01:23:26,558
Just a two-line item in the paper:

1131
01:23:26,731 --> 01:23:29,359
"Victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp."

1132
01:23:30,535 --> 01:23:32,867
I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word.

1133
01:23:33,138 --> 01:23:34,366
Then it came.

1134
01:23:34,572 --> 01:23:36,733
He was dead.
Shot trying to escape.

1135
01:23:38,042 --> 01:23:40,533
I was lonely.
I had nothing, not even hope.

1136
01:23:41,946 --> 01:23:43,379
Then I met you.

1137
01:23:43,715 --> 01:23:47,048
Why weren't you honest with me?
Why did you keep your marriage a secret?

1138
01:23:47,252 --> 01:23:50,312
It wasn't my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.

1139
01:23:50,522 --> 01:23:53,047
Not even our closest friends
knew about our marriage.

1140
01:23:53,491 --> 01:23:56,460
That was his way of protecting me.
I knew so much about his work.

1141
01:23:56,661 --> 01:23:59,960
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife
it would be dangerous for me...

1142
01:24:00,131 --> 01:24:01,655
...and for those working with us.

1143
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:04,632
And when did you first find out
he was alive?

1144
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:08,195
Just before you and I
were to leave Paris together.

1145
01:24:08,373 --> 01:24:10,807
A friend came and told me
that Victor was alive.

1146
01:24:10,975 --> 01:24:14,103
They were hiding him in a freight car
on the outskirts of Paris.

1147
01:24:14,446 --> 01:24:16,437
He was sick. He needed me.

1148
01:24:18,016 --> 01:24:20,644
I wanted to tell you,
but I didn't dare.

1149
01:24:20,819 --> 01:24:24,778
I knew you wouldn't have left Paris,
and the Gestapo would have caught you.

1150
01:24:25,824 --> 01:24:27,553
Well...

1151
01:24:27,892 --> 01:24:29,553
...well, you know the rest.

1152
01:24:32,530 --> 01:24:35,590
Well, it's still a story without an ending.

1153
01:24:35,767 --> 01:24:36,893
What about now?

1154
01:24:38,136 --> 01:24:39,125
Now?

1155
01:24:39,938 --> 01:24:41,462
I don't know.

1156
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:45,166
I know that I'll never have the strength
to leave you again.

1157
01:24:46,377 --> 01:24:47,435
And Laszlo?

1158
01:24:47,812 --> 01:24:51,043
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.

1159
01:24:51,216 --> 01:24:54,549
Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.

1160
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:56,209
All except one.

1161
01:24:57,689 --> 01:24:59,122
He won't have you.

1162
01:25:01,259 --> 01:25:03,022
I can't fight it anymore.

1163
01:25:04,796 --> 01:25:07,128
I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.

1164
01:25:10,101 --> 01:25:13,161
Oh, I don't know
what's right any longer.

1165
01:25:13,338 --> 01:25:15,397
You have to think for both of us.

1166
01:25:16,407 --> 01:25:17,806
For all of us.

1167
01:25:21,412 --> 01:25:24,074
All right. I will.

1168
01:25:28,219 --> 01:25:29,914
Here's looking at you, kid.

1169
01:25:31,723 --> 01:25:34,817
I wish I didn't love you so much.

1170
01:25:47,205 --> 01:25:49,264
- I think we lost them.
- Yes.

1171
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:52,603
- I'm afraid they caught some of the others.
- Come inside.

1172
01:25:56,915 --> 01:26:01,784
Come, Mr. Laszlo,
I will help you immediately.

1173
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:03,783
Thank you.

1174
01:26:21,239 --> 01:26:23,400
Carl, what happened?

1175
01:26:23,575 --> 01:26:27,204
The police break up our meeting, Herr Rick.
We escaped at the last moment.

1176
01:26:27,412 --> 01:26:29,710
- Come up here a minute.
- Yes, I come.

1177
01:26:29,881 --> 01:26:33,180
Turn out the light in the rear entrance.
It might attract the police.

1178
01:26:33,384 --> 01:26:36,080
- But Sascha always puts out that light.
- Tonight he forgot.

1179
01:26:36,788 --> 01:26:39,018
Yes, I come. I will do it.

1180
01:26:46,698 --> 01:26:50,190
- I want you to take Miss Lund home.
- Yes, sir.

1181
01:27:01,179 --> 01:27:04,307
It's nothing, just a little cut.
We had to get through a window.

1182
01:27:04,482 --> 01:27:06,245
This might come in handy.

1183
01:27:06,451 --> 01:27:07,543
Thank you.

1184
01:27:07,785 --> 01:27:10,379
- Had a close one, eh?
- Yes, rather.

1185
01:27:12,423 --> 01:27:15,153
Don't you sometimes wonder
if it's worth all this?

1186
01:27:15,326 --> 01:27:17,260
I mean, what you're fighting for.

1187
01:27:18,262 --> 01:27:20,355
We might as well question
why we breathe.

1188
01:27:20,531 --> 01:27:22,089
If we stop breathing, we'll die.

1189
01:27:22,266 --> 01:27:24,700
If we stop fighting our enemies,
the world will die.

1190
01:27:24,869 --> 01:27:27,133
What of it?
Then it'll be out of its misery.

1191
01:27:27,305 --> 01:27:29,466
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine?

1192
01:27:29,641 --> 01:27:33,805
Like a man who's trying to convince himself
of something he doesn't believe in his heart.

1193
01:27:33,978 --> 01:27:37,573
Each of us has a destiny.
For good, or for evil.

1194
01:27:38,116 --> 01:27:40,641
- I get the point.
- I wonder if you do.

1195
01:27:40,985 --> 01:27:44,079
I wonder if you know that you're trying
to escape from yourself...

1196
01:27:44,288 --> 01:27:45,846
...and that you'll never succeed.

1197
01:27:46,024 --> 01:27:48,254
You seem to know all about my destiny.

1198
01:27:50,061 --> 01:27:52,655
I know a good deal more
about you than you suspect.

1199
01:27:53,031 --> 01:27:55,226
I know that you're in love with a woman.

1200
01:27:55,433 --> 01:27:57,196
It's perhaps a strange circumstance...

1201
01:27:57,368 --> 01:28:00,269
...that we both should be in love
with the same woman.

1202
01:28:00,438 --> 01:28:02,599
The first evening I came into this café...

1203
01:28:02,774 --> 01:28:05,140
...I knew there was something
between you and Ilsa.

1204
01:28:05,943 --> 01:28:07,604
Since no one is to blame...

1205
01:28:08,046 --> 01:28:10,037
...I demand no explanation.

1206
01:28:10,214 --> 01:28:13,513
I ask only one thing.
You won't give me the letters of transit.

1207
01:28:13,685 --> 01:28:15,243
All right.

1208
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:17,354
But I want my wife to be safe.

1209
01:28:17,622 --> 01:28:19,055
I ask you as a favor...

1210
01:28:19,223 --> 01:28:22,158
...to use the letters
to take her away from Casablanca.

1211
01:28:22,326 --> 01:28:23,418
You love her that much?

1212
01:28:23,628 --> 01:28:26,392
Apparently you think of me only
as the leader of a cause.

1213
01:28:27,031 --> 01:28:29,556
Well, I am also a human being.

1214
01:28:30,401 --> 01:28:31,891
Yes, I love her that much.

1215
01:28:39,711 --> 01:28:41,008
- Monsieur Laszlo?
- Yes?

1216
01:28:41,179 --> 01:28:43,704
You'll come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1217
01:28:43,881 --> 01:28:44,870
On what charge?

1218
01:28:45,049 --> 01:28:47,244
Captain Renault will discuss that
with you later.

1219
01:28:47,418 --> 01:28:50,148
It seems that destiny has taken a hand.

1220
01:29:01,933 --> 01:29:06,097
You haven't any proof, and you know it.
This isn't Germany or occupied France.

1221
01:29:06,270 --> 01:29:10,331
All you can do is fine him and give him
30 days. You might as well let him go now.

1222
01:29:10,508 --> 01:29:13,534
I'd advise you not to be too interested
in what happens to Laszlo.

1223
01:29:13,711 --> 01:29:15,178
If you were to help him escape--

1224
01:29:15,346 --> 01:29:17,780
What makes you think
I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?

1225
01:29:17,949 --> 01:29:20,417
Because, one,
you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.

1226
01:29:20,585 --> 01:29:23,679
Two, you've got the letters of transit.
Don't bother to deny it.

1227
01:29:23,888 --> 01:29:26,948
And you might do it simply
because you don't like Strasser's looks.

1228
01:29:27,125 --> 01:29:28,990
As a matter of fact,
I don't either.

1229
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:30,559
They're all excellent reasons.

1230
01:29:30,728 --> 01:29:32,662
Don't count too much on my friendship.

1231
01:29:32,830 --> 01:29:36,288
In this matter I'm powerless.
Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.

1232
01:29:36,634 --> 01:29:41,196
You're not very subtle,
but you are effective. I get the point.

1233
01:29:41,372 --> 01:29:42,862
Yes, I have the letters.

1234
01:29:43,074 --> 01:29:44,871
But I intend using them myself.

1235
01:29:45,276 --> 01:29:48,803
I'm leaving Casablanca
on tonight's plane. The last plane.

1236
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:52,040
And I'm taking a friend with me.
One you'll appreciate.

1237
01:29:52,216 --> 01:29:54,184
- What friend?
- Ilsa Lund.

1238
01:29:54,352 --> 01:29:57,947
That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape.

1239
01:29:58,122 --> 01:30:00,147
The last man I want to see in America.

1240
01:30:00,391 --> 01:30:03,588
You didn't come here to tell me this.
You have the letters of transit.

1241
01:30:03,761 --> 01:30:06,924
You can fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please.

1242
01:30:07,098 --> 01:30:09,726
Why are you still interested
in what happens to Laszlo?

1243
01:30:09,934 --> 01:30:14,132
I'm not. But I am interested
in what happens to Ilsa and me.

1244
01:30:14,372 --> 01:30:16,340
We have a legal right to go,
that's true...

1245
01:30:16,507 --> 01:30:20,034
...but people have been held in Casablanca
in spite of their legal rights.

1246
01:30:20,211 --> 01:30:23,578
- What makes you think we want to hold you?
- Ilsa is Laszlo's wife.

1247
01:30:23,748 --> 01:30:26,444
She probably knows things
that Strasser would like to know.

1248
01:30:26,617 --> 01:30:28,141
Louis, I'll make a deal with you.

1249
01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:31,846
Instead of this petty charge against him,
you could get something big...

1250
01:30:32,023 --> 01:30:35,288
...something that would chuck him
in a concentration camp for years...

1251
01:30:35,459 --> 01:30:38,053
- Be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
- Certainly.

1252
01:30:38,229 --> 01:30:40,390
Germany--
Vichy would be very grateful.

1253
01:30:40,598 --> 01:30:41,622
Then release him.

1254
01:30:41,799 --> 01:30:44,427
You be at my place a half-hour
before the plane leaves.

1255
01:30:44,602 --> 01:30:47,127
I'll have Laszlo come there
to pick up the letters...

1256
01:30:47,338 --> 01:30:49,932
...and that'll give you grounds
to make the arrest.

1257
01:30:50,208 --> 01:30:52,506
You get him, and we get away.

1258
01:30:52,677 --> 01:30:55,578
To the Germans,
that last will be just a minor annoyance.

1259
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:58,578
There's still something about this
I don't quite understand.

1260
01:30:58,783 --> 01:31:01,479
Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes...

1261
01:31:01,652 --> 01:31:03,984
...but you were never interested
in any woman.

1262
01:31:04,155 --> 01:31:06,783
- She isn't just any woman.
- I see.

1263
01:31:07,391 --> 01:31:09,791
How do I know you'll keep
your end of the bargain?

1264
01:31:09,961 --> 01:31:12,828
I'll make the arrangements now
with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

1265
01:31:12,997 --> 01:31:17,457
I'm gonna miss you. You're the only one
in Casablanca who has less scruples than I.

1266
01:31:17,735 --> 01:31:18,997
Oh, thanks.

1267
01:31:19,637 --> 01:31:20,729
Go ahead, Ricky.

1268
01:31:20,938 --> 01:31:25,307
Call off your watchdogs when you let him go.
I don't want them around this afternoon.

1269
01:31:25,476 --> 01:31:27,808
I'm taking no chances, Louis,
not even with you.

1270
01:31:35,419 --> 01:31:37,979
Should we draw up papers,
or is a handshake good enough?

1271
01:31:38,155 --> 01:31:41,420
Certainly not good enough.
But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.

1272
01:31:41,726 --> 01:31:45,059
To get out of Casablanca and
go to America... You're a lucky man.

1273
01:31:45,263 --> 01:31:50,667
My agreement with Sam is that he gets
25 percent of the profits. That still goes.

1274
01:31:50,835 --> 01:31:53,633
I happen to know he gets 10 percent.
But he's worth 25.

1275
01:31:53,804 --> 01:31:56,773
Abdul, Carl and Sascha,
they stay with the place or I don't sell.

1276
01:31:56,974 --> 01:31:59,408
Of course.
Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.

1277
01:31:59,577 --> 01:32:00,908
Well, so long.

1278
01:32:01,078 --> 01:32:04,104
Don't forget you owe Rick's
100 cartons of American cigarettes.

1279
01:32:04,282 --> 01:32:06,773
I shall remember to pay it to myself.

1280
01:32:41,752 --> 01:32:44,482
- You're late.
- I was informed when Laszlo left the hotel...

1281
01:32:44,655 --> 01:32:45,952
...so I knew I'd be on time.

1282
01:32:46,123 --> 01:32:49,149
- I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
- He won't be followed here.

1283
01:32:49,327 --> 01:32:51,420
This place will never be
the same without you.

1284
01:32:51,629 --> 01:32:55,156
I know what you mean. But I've spoken
to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.

1285
01:32:55,333 --> 01:32:58,063
- Is everything ready?
- I have the letters right here.

1286
01:32:58,235 --> 01:33:00,430
When we searched the place,
where were they?

1287
01:33:00,604 --> 01:33:01,764
Sam's piano.

1288
01:33:02,506 --> 01:33:04,440
Serves me right for not being musical.

1289
01:33:04,709 --> 01:33:05,733
Here they are.

1290
01:33:06,243 --> 01:33:07,972
You better wait in my office.

1291
01:33:17,688 --> 01:33:20,282
Victor thinks I'm leaving with him.
Haven't you told him?

1292
01:33:20,458 --> 01:33:22,892
- Not yet.
- But you were able to arrange everything?

1293
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:24,425
Everything is quite all right.

1294
01:33:24,595 --> 01:33:27,621
We'll tell him at the airport.
The less time to think, the easier.

1295
01:33:27,798 --> 01:33:29,629
Please trust me.

1296
01:33:31,669 --> 01:33:32,897
Yes, I will.

1297
01:33:38,109 --> 01:33:42,205
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Save it. We've still lots of things to do.

1298
01:33:44,015 --> 01:33:47,109
- I brought the money.
- Keep it, you'll need it in America.

1299
01:33:47,518 --> 01:33:49,418
- But we made a deal.
- Never mind that.

1300
01:33:49,587 --> 01:33:52,886
- You won't have any trouble in Lisbon?
- No. It's all arranged.

1301
01:33:53,057 --> 01:33:55,389
Good. I've got the letters here,
made out in blank.

1302
01:33:55,559 --> 01:33:57,993
All you have to do is fill
in the signatures.

1303
01:33:58,162 --> 01:33:59,561
Victor Laszlo.

1304
01:34:00,097 --> 01:34:02,827
Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.

1305
01:34:05,436 --> 01:34:09,429
The charge of accessory to the murder of the
couriers from whom the letters were stolen.

1306
01:34:10,041 --> 01:34:13,272
You're surprised about my friend Ricky?
The explanation is simple.

1307
01:34:13,477 --> 01:34:16,446
Love, it seems,
has triumphed over virtue. Thank--

1308
01:34:17,248 --> 01:34:21,685
Not so fast, Louis. Nobody is going
to be arrested. Not for a while yet.

1309
01:34:21,852 --> 01:34:23,843
- Have you lost your mind?
- I have. Sit down.

1310
01:34:24,021 --> 01:34:26,148
- Put that gun down.
- I don't want to shoot you...

1311
01:34:26,323 --> 01:34:28,188
...but I will if you take one more step.

1312
01:34:28,893 --> 01:34:31,123
Under the circumstances,
I will sit down.

1313
01:34:34,365 --> 01:34:37,857
- Keep your hands on the table.
- I wonder if you realize what this means.

1314
01:34:38,035 --> 01:34:40,162
I do. We've got time to discuss that later.

1315
01:34:40,337 --> 01:34:41,929
Call off your watchdogs, you said.

1316
01:34:42,106 --> 01:34:44,734
Just the same, call the airport
and let me hear you tell them.

1317
01:34:44,909 --> 01:34:47,309
And remember,
this gun is pointed right at your heart.

1318
01:34:47,478 --> 01:34:49,571
That is my least vulnerable spot.

1319
01:34:57,121 --> 01:34:59,180
Hello? Is that the airport?

1320
01:35:00,491 --> 01:35:02,152
This is Captain Renault speaking.

1321
01:35:02,359 --> 01:35:04,919
There'll be two letters of transit
for the Lisbon plane.

1322
01:35:05,096 --> 01:35:06,893
There's to be no trouble about them.

1323
01:35:07,331 --> 01:35:08,320
Good.

1324
01:35:08,766 --> 01:35:09,926
Hello?

1325
01:35:15,039 --> 01:35:16,438
My car, quickly!

1326
01:35:18,109 --> 01:35:19,201
This is Major Strasser.

1327
01:35:19,376 --> 01:35:21,844
Have a squad of police meet me
at the airport at once.

1328
01:35:22,012 --> 01:35:23,309
At once, do you hear?

1329
01:35:30,454 --> 01:35:32,479
Hello, radio tower?

1330
01:35:32,656 --> 01:35:35,750
Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes,
east runway.

1331
01:35:36,026 --> 01:35:38,494
Visibility, 1 1/2 miles.

1332
01:35:38,662 --> 01:35:42,598
Light ground fog.
Depth of fog approximately 500.

1333
01:35:42,766 --> 01:35:45,496
Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.

1334
01:35:58,015 --> 01:36:00,745
Have your man go with Laszlo
and take care of his luggage.

1335
01:36:00,918 --> 01:36:02,681
Certainly, Rick, anything you say.

1336
01:36:02,887 --> 01:36:06,288
- Find Laszlo's luggage. Put it on the plane.
- Yes, sir.

1337
01:36:06,457 --> 01:36:07,446
This way, please.

1338
01:36:09,326 --> 01:36:12,454
If you don't mind, fill in the names.
That'll make it more official.

1339
01:36:12,630 --> 01:36:14,655
You think of everything, don't you?

1340
01:36:14,832 --> 01:36:17,266
And the names are
Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

1341
01:36:17,468 --> 01:36:21,029
- But why my name, Richard?
- Because you're getting on that plane.

1342
01:36:21,205 --> 01:36:22,797
I don't understand.
What about you?

1343
01:36:22,973 --> 01:36:25,066
I'm staying with him
till the plane gets away.

1344
01:36:25,242 --> 01:36:27,233
No. What has happened?
Last night you said--

1345
01:36:27,411 --> 01:36:29,208
Last night we said a great many things.

1346
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:31,280
You said I was to do the thinking for us.

1347
01:36:31,448 --> 01:36:34,110
I've done a lot of it since then.
It adds up to one thing:

1348
01:36:34,285 --> 01:36:36,947
You're getting on that plane
with Victor where you belong.

1349
01:36:37,121 --> 01:36:38,952
Now, you've got to listen to me.

1350
01:36:39,123 --> 01:36:42,024
Any idea what you'd have
to look forward to if you stayed here?

1351
01:36:42,193 --> 01:36:45,492
Chances are we'd both wind up
in a concentration camp. True, Louis?

1352
01:36:45,663 --> 01:36:47,927
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

1353
01:36:48,098 --> 01:36:51,534
- You're saying this only to make me go.
- I'm saying it because it's true.

1354
01:36:51,735 --> 01:36:53,965
Inside of us we both know
you belong with Victor.

1355
01:36:54,138 --> 01:36:56,504
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

1356
01:36:56,674 --> 01:36:59,541
If that plane leaves
and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

1357
01:36:59,743 --> 01:37:03,235
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

1358
01:37:04,114 --> 01:37:06,207
But what about us?

1359
01:37:06,383 --> 01:37:07,782
We'll always have Paris.

1360
01:37:07,952 --> 01:37:10,944
We didn't have-- We'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.

1361
01:37:11,355 --> 01:37:13,016
We got it back last night.

1362
01:37:13,924 --> 01:37:17,690
- When I said I would never leave you.
- And you never will.

1363
01:37:18,195 --> 01:37:19,685
But I've got a job to do too.

1364
01:37:19,897 --> 01:37:23,628
Where I'm going, you can't follow.
What I've got to do you can't be any part of.

1365
01:37:24,235 --> 01:37:25,759
Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble.

1366
01:37:25,936 --> 01:37:29,394
But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of three little people...

1367
01:37:29,573 --> 01:37:32,269
...don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

1368
01:37:32,443 --> 01:37:34,968
Someday you'll understand that.

1369
01:37:36,146 --> 01:37:37,909
Now, now.

1370
01:37:39,550 --> 01:37:41,848
Here's looking at you, kid.

1371
01:37:57,001 --> 01:37:59,492
- Everything is in order.
- All except one thing.

1372
01:37:59,737 --> 01:38:01,864
There's something you should know.

1373
01:38:02,106 --> 01:38:03,903
I don't ask you to explain anything.

1374
01:38:04,074 --> 01:38:07,168
I'm going to anyway.
It may make a difference to you later on.

1375
01:38:07,344 --> 01:38:09,209
You said you knew about Ilsa and me.

1376
01:38:09,380 --> 01:38:12,247
You didn't know she was at my place
last night when you were.

1377
01:38:12,416 --> 01:38:15,852
She came there for the letters of transit.
Isn't that true, Ilsa?

1378
01:38:16,287 --> 01:38:17,515
Yes.

1379
01:38:17,688 --> 01:38:19,713
She tried everything to get them.
Nothing worked.

1380
01:38:19,890 --> 01:38:23,417
She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.

1381
01:38:23,594 --> 01:38:26,119
But that was all over long ago.

1382
01:38:26,297 --> 01:38:29,562
For your sake, she pretended it wasn't,
and I let her pretend.

1383
01:38:30,067 --> 01:38:31,694
I understand.

1384
01:38:31,869 --> 01:38:34,064
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

1385
01:38:34,772 --> 01:38:36,569
I appreciate it.

1386
01:38:37,441 --> 01:38:39,204
Welcome back to the fight.

1387
01:38:39,410 --> 01:38:41,935
This time I know our side will win.

1388
01:38:55,659 --> 01:38:57,820
Are you ready, Ilsa?

1389
01:38:59,697 --> 01:39:01,062
Yes, I'm ready.

1390
01:39:04,201 --> 01:39:05,566
Goodbye, Rick.

1391
01:39:06,437 --> 01:39:08,337
God bless you.

1392
01:39:09,673 --> 01:39:12,369
You better hurry.
You'll miss that plane.

1393
01:39:30,427 --> 01:39:32,361
I was right.
You are a sentimentalist.

1394
01:39:32,529 --> 01:39:35,362
Stay where you are.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1395
01:39:35,532 --> 01:39:36,863
What you just did for Laszlo.

1396
01:39:37,034 --> 01:39:39,434
That fairy tale you invented
to send Ilsa away with him.

1397
01:39:39,603 --> 01:39:41,935
I know a little about women, my friend.
She went.

1398
01:39:42,139 --> 01:39:44,164
But she knew you were lying.

1399
01:39:44,341 --> 01:39:46,275
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

1400
01:39:46,443 --> 01:39:50,743
I suppose you know this isn't going to be
pleasant for either of us. Especially for you.

1401
01:39:50,914 --> 01:39:54,406
- I'll have to arrest you, of course.
- As soon as the plane goes, Louis.

1402
01:40:01,458 --> 01:40:05,792
- What was the meaning of that phone call?
- Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

1403
01:40:08,365 --> 01:40:10,458
Why do you stand here?
Why don't you stop him?

1404
01:40:10,634 --> 01:40:12,659
Ask Monsieur Rick.

1405
01:40:14,972 --> 01:40:17,805
- Get away from that phone.
- I advise you not to interfere.

1406
01:40:18,008 --> 01:40:21,273
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault,
and I'm willing to shoot you.

1407
01:40:23,247 --> 01:40:24,805
- Hello!
- Put that phone down.

1408
01:40:24,982 --> 01:40:26,847
- Get me the radio tower.
- Put it down!

1409
01:40:41,899 --> 01:40:43,457
Major Strasser has been shot.

1410
01:40:48,238 --> 01:40:50,866
Round up the usual suspects.

1411
01:41:14,598 --> 01:41:18,261
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist,
but you've become a patriot.

1412
01:41:18,435 --> 01:41:20,596
Maybe, but it seemed
like a good time to start.

1413
01:41:20,771 --> 01:41:23,001
I think perhaps you're right.

1414
01:41:47,798 --> 01:41:51,495
It might be a good idea for you
to disappear from Casablanca for a while.

1415
01:41:51,668 --> 01:41:54,102
There's a Free French garrison
over at Brazzaville.

1416
01:41:54,271 --> 01:41:58,071
- I could be induced to arrange a passage.
- My letter of transit?

1417
01:41:58,308 --> 01:41:59,536
I could use a trip.

1418
01:41:59,743 --> 01:42:03,008
But it doesn't change our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 francs.

1419
01:42:03,247 --> 01:42:06,148
That 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

1420
01:42:06,316 --> 01:42:07,544
"Our" expenses?

1421
01:42:08,385 --> 01:42:12,583
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
