1
00:01:11,736 --> 00:01:14,863
<i>With the coming
of the Second World War...</i>

2
00:01:14,864 --> 00:01:19,201
<i>many eyes in imprisoned Europe
turned hopefully, or desperately...</i>

3
00:01:19,202 --> 00:01:22,120
<i>toward the freedom of the Americas.</i>

4
00:01:22,121 --> 00:01:24,957
<i>Lisbon became
the great embarkation point.</i>

5
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:28,544
<i>But not everybody could get
to Lisbon directly.</i>

6
00:01:28,545 --> 00:01:33,257
<i>And so a torturous, roundabout
refugee trail sprang up.</i>

7
00:01:33,258 --> 00:01:38,258
<i>Paris to Marseilles...</i>

8
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,890
<i>across the Mediterranean to Oran.</i>

9
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,571
<i>Then, by train or auto or foot,
across the rim of Africa...</i>

10
00:01:55,572 --> 00:01:58,323
<i>to Casablanca in French Morocco.</i>

11
00:01:58,324 --> 00:02:03,161
<i>Here, the fortunate ones,
through money or influence or luck...</i>

12
00:02:03,162 --> 00:02:06,873
<i>might obtain exit visas
and scurry to Lisbon.</i>

13
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:09,334
<i>And from Lisbon to the New World.</i>

14
00:02:09,335 --> 00:02:13,171
<i>But the others wait in Casablanca.</i>

15
00:02:13,172 --> 00:02:16,842
<i>And wait and wait...</i>

16
00:02:16,843 --> 00:02:18,844
<i>and wait.</i>

17
00:02:28,313 --> 00:02:30,063
To all Officers:

18
00:02:30,064 --> 00:02:35,064
Two German couriers carrying official
documents murdered on train from Oran.

19
00:02:35,153 --> 00:02:38,363
Murderer and possible accomplices
headed for Casablanca.

20
00:02:38,364 --> 00:02:42,576
Round up all suspicious characters
and search them for stolen document.

21
00:02:42,577 --> 00:02:47,577
Important.

22
00:03:15,693 --> 00:03:17,402
May we see your papers?

23
00:03:17,403 --> 00:03:19,279
I don't think I have them on me.

24
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,741
- In that case, you'll have to come along.
- Wait. It's possible that I...

25
00:03:22,742 --> 00:03:27,742
Yes. Here they are.

26
00:03:27,997 --> 00:03:31,124
These papers expired three weeks ago.
You'll have to come along.

27
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,502
Halt!

28
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:35,337
Halt!

29
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:02,906
- What on earth is going on there?
- I don't know, my dear.

30
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:05,492
Pardon, monsieur. Pardon, madame.
Have you not heard?

31
00:04:05,493 --> 00:04:08,495
We hear very little,
and we understand even less.

32
00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:11,081
Two German couriers
were found murdered in the desert.

33
00:04:11,082 --> 00:04:12,332
The unoccupied desert.

34
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,001
This is the customary roundup
of refugees, liberals...

35
00:04:15,002 --> 00:04:20,002
and, of course, a beautiful young girl
for Renault, the prefect of police.

36
00:04:23,302 --> 00:04:25,470
Along with these unhappy refugees...

37
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,056
the scum of Europe
has gravitated to Casablanca.

38
00:04:28,057 --> 00:04:30,267
Some of them have been waiting
years for a visa.

39
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:33,520
I beg of you, monsieur, watch yourself.
Be on guard.

40
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:35,689
This place is full of vultures.

41
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,608
Vultures everywhere. Everywhere!

42
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:41,528
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Not at all. <i>Au</i> revoir, monsieur.

43
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:43,238
<i>- Au revoir,</i> madame.
<i>- Au revoir.</i>

44
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:45,323
What an amusing little fellow.

45
00:04:45,324 --> 00:04:48,160
Waiter.

46
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:50,162
- Oh, how silly of me.
- What, dear?

47
00:04:50,163 --> 00:04:54,416
I've left my wallet in the hotel.

48
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:13,389
Perhaps tomorrow
we'll be on the plane.

49
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,751
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

50
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:40,003
It is good to see you again,
Major Strasser.

51
00:05:40,004 --> 00:05:41,505
Thank you, thank you.

52
00:05:41,506 --> 00:05:45,801
May I present Captain Renault, police
prefect of Casablanca. Major Strasser.

53
00:05:45,802 --> 00:05:48,178
Unoccupied France welcomes you
to Casablanca.

54
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:50,222
Thank you, Captain.
It's good to be here.

55
00:05:50,223 --> 00:05:53,016
Major Strasser, my aide,
Lieutenant Casselle.

56
00:05:53,017 --> 00:05:55,644
Captain Tonnelli.
The Italian service at your command.

57
00:05:55,645 --> 00:05:57,020
That is kind of you.

58
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:06,321
You may find the climate
of Casablanca a trifle warm.

59
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:10,325
We Germans must get used to all
climates, from Russia to the Sahara.

60
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:12,452
Perhaps you
weren't referring to weather.

61
00:06:12,453 --> 00:06:13,703
What else?

62
00:06:13,704 --> 00:06:15,872
The murder of the couriers.
What has been done?

63
00:06:15,873 --> 00:06:19,835
My men are rounding up
twice the usual number of suspects.

64
00:06:19,836 --> 00:06:21,795
But we know already
who the murderer is.

65
00:06:21,796 --> 00:06:23,088
Good. Is he in custody?

66
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:26,174
No hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's.
Everybody comes to Rick's.

67
00:06:26,175 --> 00:06:30,929
I've already heard about this café.
And also about Mr. Rick himself.

68
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:40,188
<i>It had to be you
it had to be you.</i>

69
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:45,189
<i>I wandered around and finally found
The somebody who.</i>

70
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:50,319
<i>Could make me be true
Could make me be blue.</i>

71
00:06:50,575 --> 00:06:55,575
<i>And even be glad just to be sad
Thinking of you.</i>

72
00:06:55,746 --> 00:07:00,746
<i>Some others I've seen
Might never be mean.</i>

73
00:07:01,002 --> 00:07:06,002
<i>Might never be cross, or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do.</i>

74
00:07:06,215 --> 00:07:08,925
<i>For nobody else gave me</i> a <i>thrill.</i>

75
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:11,845
<i>Honey, with all your faults
I love you still.</i>

76
00:07:11,846 --> 00:07:16,846
<i>Had to be you, wonderful you
Had to be you</i>

77
00:07:18,978 --> 00:07:22,063
'Cause my hair is Curly.

78
00:07:22,064 --> 00:07:25,317
<i>'Cause my teeth are pearly.</i>

79
00:07:25,318 --> 00:07:27,652
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

80
00:07:27,653 --> 00:07:29,988
I'll never get out of here.

81
00:07:29,989 --> 00:07:32,073
I'll die in Casablanca.

82
00:07:32,074 --> 00:07:34,451
But can't you make it
just a little more?

83
00:07:34,452 --> 00:07:35,660
Please?

84
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:39,289
Sorry, but diamonds are a drug on
the market. Everybody sells diamonds.

85
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,708
There are diamonds everywhere. 2400.

86
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:43,043
All right.

87
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:45,962
The trucks are waiting.
The men are waiting. Everything...

88
00:07:49,884 --> 00:07:52,093
It's the fishing Smack Santiago.

89
00:07:52,094 --> 00:07:56,681
It leaves at 1 tomorrow night, here
from the end of La Medina. Third boat.

90
00:07:56,682 --> 00:08:00,185
- Thank you. Thank you.
- And bring 15,000 francs in cash.

91
00:08:00,186 --> 00:08:02,604
Remember, in cash.

92
00:08:09,195 --> 00:08:11,196
Cheerio.

93
00:08:11,197 --> 00:08:16,197
- Open up, Abdul.
- Yes, professor.

94
00:08:23,501 --> 00:08:24,960
- Waiter?
- Yes, madame?

95
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:27,963
Will you ask Rick
if he'll have a drink with us?

96
00:08:27,964 --> 00:08:32,133
He never drinks with customers.
Never. I have never seen it.

97
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:34,552
What makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?

98
00:08:34,553 --> 00:08:35,971
Perhaps if you told him...

99
00:08:35,972 --> 00:08:38,723
I ran the second-largest
banking house in Amsterdam.

100
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:41,393
Second largest?
That wouldn't impress Rick.

101
00:08:41,394 --> 00:08:45,146
The leading banker in Amsterdam
is now the pastry chef in our kitchen.

102
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:48,942
We have something
to look forward to.

103
00:08:48,943 --> 00:08:53,488
And his father is the bellboy.

104
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:54,101
Monsieur.

105
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:24,769
Excuse me.

106
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,272
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a private room.

107
00:09:27,273 --> 00:09:31,443
Of all the nerve. Who do you think...?
I know there is gambling in there.

108
00:09:31,444 --> 00:09:34,279
- You dare not keep me out.
- Yes? What's the trouble?

109
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,490
I have been in every gambling room
between Honolulu and Berlin.

110
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:40,660
And if you think I'm going to be kept out
of a saloon like this...

111
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:41,953
you're much mistaken.

112
00:09:41,954 --> 00:09:46,332
Excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.

113
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,460
Your cash is good at the bar.

114
00:09:48,461 --> 00:09:50,503
What? Do you know who I am?

115
00:09:50,504 --> 00:09:52,672
I do. You're lucky the bar is open to you.

116
00:09:52,673 --> 00:09:57,673
This is outrageous!
I shall report it to The Angriff.

117
00:09:58,471 --> 00:10:03,141
Watching you just now, one would
think you've been doing this all your life.

118
00:10:03,142 --> 00:10:06,186
- What makes you think I haven't?
- Nothing.

119
00:10:06,187 --> 00:10:10,607
- But when you first came, I thought...
- You thought what?

120
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:15,608
What right do I have to think?

121
00:10:17,907 --> 00:10:20,283
May I?

122
00:10:20,284 --> 00:10:22,994
Too bad about those two
German couriers, wasn't it?

123
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:25,830
They got a lucky break.
Yesterday they were just Clerks...

124
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:28,708
today they are the honored dead.

125
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:32,378
You are a very cynical person, Rick,
if you'll forgive me for saying so.

126
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:33,671
I forgive you.

127
00:10:33,672 --> 00:10:35,548
- Will you have a drink with me?
- No.

128
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:39,469
I forgot, you never drink with...
I'll have another, please.

129
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,513
You despise me, don't you?

130
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:43,765
If I gave you any thought,
I probably would.

131
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:45,934
But Why?

132
00:10:45,935 --> 00:10:48,853
Do you object
to the kind of business I do?

133
00:10:48,854 --> 00:10:53,525
But think of all those poor refugees who
must rot here if I didn't help them.

134
00:10:53,526 --> 00:10:58,321
That's not so bad. Through ways of
my own, I provide them with exit visas.

135
00:10:58,322 --> 00:11:02,075
For a price, Ugarte. For a price.

136
00:11:02,076 --> 00:11:05,328
But think of all the poor devils
who can't meet Renault's price.

137
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:08,873
I get it for them for half.
Is that so parasitic?

138
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:13,211
I don't mind a parasite.
I object to a cut-rate one.

139
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:16,214
Well, after tonight I will be through
with the whole business.

140
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:19,092
And I'm leaving, finally,
this Casablanca.

141
00:11:19,093 --> 00:11:22,512
Who did you bribe for your visa?
Renault or yourself?

142
00:11:22,513 --> 00:11:26,349
Myself.
I found myself much more reasonable.

143
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,226
Look, Rick.

144
00:11:28,227 --> 00:11:30,186
Know what this is?

145
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:33,231
Something that even you
have never seen.

146
00:11:33,232 --> 00:11:36,568
Letters of transit signed
by General de Gaulle.

147
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:39,988
Cannot be rescinded.
Not even questioned.

148
00:11:39,989 --> 00:11:41,239
One moment.

149
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,659
Tonight I'll be selling those
for more money than I ever dreamed of.

150
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,912
And then, <i>addio,</i> Casablanca.

151
00:11:47,913 --> 00:11:50,582
I have many a friend in Casablanca,
but somehow...

152
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,918
just because you despise me,
you are the only one I trust.

153
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,920
Will you keep these for me, please?

154
00:11:55,921 --> 00:11:58,840
- For how long?
- Perhaps an hour. Perhaps a little longer.

155
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:01,759
- I don't want them here overnight.
- Don't be afraid of that.

156
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,595
Please keep them for me.

157
00:12:03,596 --> 00:12:06,264
Thank you.
I knew I could trust you.

158
00:12:06,265 --> 00:12:08,433
Waiter. I'll be expecting some people.

159
00:12:08,434 --> 00:12:12,520
If anybody asks for me,
I'll be right here.

160
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:13,771
Rick...

161
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:17,192
I hope you're more impressed
with me now.

162
00:12:17,193 --> 00:12:20,612
If you'll forgive me, I'll share my
good luck with your roulette wheel.

163
00:12:20,613 --> 00:12:23,781
Just a moment.

164
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:28,203
I heard a rumor those two German
couriers were carrying letters of transit.

165
00:12:28,204 --> 00:12:29,787
Huh?

166
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:34,417
Oh. I've heard that
rumor too. Poor devils.

167
00:12:34,418 --> 00:12:39,418
You're right, Ugarte.
I am a little more impressed with you.

168
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:51,851
<i>- Say, Who's got trouble?
- We got trouble.</i>

169
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:53,811
<i>- How much trouble?
- Too much trouble.</i>

170
00:12:53,812 --> 00:12:58,812
<i>Well, now, don't you frown
Just knuckle down and knock on wood.</i>

171
00:12:59,777 --> 00:13:02,111
<i>- Who's unhappy?
- We're unhappy.</i>

172
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:04,405
<i>- How unhappy?
- Too unhappy.</i>

173
00:13:04,406 --> 00:13:09,406
<i>Uh-oh, that won't do
When you are blue just knock on wood.</i>

174
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:12,956
<i>- Who's unlucky?
- We're unlucky.</i>

175
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:15,291
<i>- How unlucky?
- Too unlucky.</i>

176
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:20,292
<i>But your luck will change
If you'll arrange to knock on wood.</i>

177
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:23,591
<i>- Who's got nothing?
- We got nothing.</i>

178
00:13:23,592 --> 00:13:26,135
<i>- How much nothing?
- Too much nothing.</i>

179
00:13:26,136 --> 00:13:31,136
<i>Say, nothing's not an awful lot
But knock on wood.</i>

180
00:13:32,643 --> 00:13:34,602
<i>- Now Who's happy?
- We're happy.</i>

181
00:13:34,603 --> 00:13:37,063
<i>- Just how happy?
- VGW happy.</i>

182
00:13:37,064 --> 00:13:42,064
<i>That's the way we're gonna say
So knock on wood.</i>

183
00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:45,154
<i>- Now Who's lucky?
- We're all lucky.</i>

184
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:47,490
<i>- Just how lucky?
- Very lucky.</i>

185
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:52,491
<i>Well, smile again and once again
Let's knock on wood.</i>

186
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:01,379
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Ferrari.

187
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,214
How's business at the Blue Parrot?

188
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:05,925
- Fine, but I'd like to buy your café.
- It's not for sale.

189
00:14:05,926 --> 00:14:09,304
- You haven't heard my offer.
- It's not for sale at any price.

190
00:14:09,305 --> 00:14:13,057
- What do you want for Sam?
- I don't buy or sell human beings.

191
00:14:13,058 --> 00:14:15,393
Too bad.
That's Casablanca's leading Commodity.

192
00:14:15,394 --> 00:14:17,478
In refugees alone
we could make a fortune...

193
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:19,647
if you'd work with me
in the black market.

194
00:14:19,648 --> 00:14:22,859
Suppose you run your business
and let me run mine.

195
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,486
Suppose we ask Sam.
Maybe he'd like to make a change.

196
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:26,738
Suppose we do.

197
00:14:26,739 --> 00:14:29,282
When will you realize
that in this world today...

198
00:14:29,283 --> 00:14:31,993
isolationism is no longer
a practical policy?

199
00:14:31,994 --> 00:14:34,829
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him
at the Blue Parrot.

200
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,122
Oh, I like it fine here.

201
00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:37,665
He'll double what I pay you.

202
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,835
I ain't got time to spend
what I make here.

203
00:14:40,836 --> 00:14:41,336
Sorry.

204
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:47,800
The boss's private stock...

205
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:50,428
- ...because, Yvonne, I love you.
- Oh, shut up.

206
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:54,599
All right, all right. For you, I shut up,
because, Yvonne, I love you.

207
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,434
Uh-oh.

208
00:14:56,435 --> 00:14:59,103
Oh, Monsieur Rick, Monsieur Rick.

209
00:14:59,104 --> 00:15:04,104
Some Germans gave this check.
Is it all right?

210
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:08,446
Where were you last night?

211
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:11,074
That's so long ago,
I don't remember.

212
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:15,703
- Will I see you tonight?
- I never make plans that far ahead.

213
00:15:15,704 --> 00:15:17,121
Give me another.

214
00:15:17,122 --> 00:15:20,041
- Sascha, She's had enough.
- Don't listen to him. Fill it up.

215
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:22,460
Yvonne, I love you,
but he pays me.

216
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:25,129
- Rick, I'm tired of having you...
- Sascha, call a cab.

217
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,673
- We're gonna get your Coat.
- Take your hands off me.

218
00:15:27,674 --> 00:15:32,674
You're going home.
You've had a little too much to drink.

219
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:35,431
Hey, taxi.

220
00:15:35,432 --> 00:15:37,725
Who do you think you are,
pushing me around?

221
00:15:37,726 --> 00:15:39,644
I was a fool
to fall for a man like you.

222
00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:41,854
Go with her, Sascha.
Be sure she gets home.

223
00:15:41,855 --> 00:15:46,855
- And come right back.
- Yes, boss.

224
00:15:56,328 --> 00:15:58,162
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Louis.

225
00:15:58,163 --> 00:16:00,665
How extravagant you are,
throwing away women.

226
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,834
Someday they may be scarce.

227
00:16:02,835 --> 00:16:05,002
I think now
I shall pay a call on Yvonne.

228
00:16:05,003 --> 00:16:06,754
Maybe get her on the rebound.

229
00:16:06,755 --> 00:16:09,674
When it comes to women,
you're a true democrat.

230
00:16:19,184 --> 00:16:22,395
If he gets a word in,
it'll be a major Italian Victory.

231
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:31,525
The plane to Lisbon.

232
00:16:32,865 --> 00:16:34,866
You would like to be on it?

233
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:36,868
Why? What's in Lisbon?

234
00:16:36,869 --> 00:16:38,953
The clipper to America.

235
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:41,873
I've often speculated on why
you don't return to America.

236
00:16:41,874 --> 00:16:46,210
Did you abscond with the Church funds?
Did you run off with a senator's wife?

237
00:16:46,211 --> 00:16:49,046
I like to think you killed a man.
It's the romantic in me.

238
00:16:49,047 --> 00:16:50,923
It's a combination of all three.

239
00:16:50,924 --> 00:16:53,551
And what in heaven's name
brought you to Casablanca?

240
00:16:53,552 --> 00:16:56,304
My health.
I came to Casablanca for the waters.

241
00:16:56,305 --> 00:17:00,057
The waters? What waters?
We're in the desert.

242
00:17:00,058 --> 00:17:04,479
- I was misinformed.
- Hm.

243
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,980
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick.

244
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:09,192
A gentleman inside
has won 20,000 francs...

245
00:17:09,193 --> 00:17:12,737
and the cashier
would like some money.

246
00:17:12,738 --> 00:17:14,155
I'll get it from the safe.

247
00:17:14,156 --> 00:17:15,907
I'm so upset, Rick. You know I...

248
00:17:15,908 --> 00:17:18,743
Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that
happen all the time.

249
00:17:18,744 --> 00:17:23,744
I'm awfully sorry.

250
00:17:26,084 --> 00:17:29,921
Rick, there will be some excitement
here tonight. An arrest in your café.

251
00:17:29,922 --> 00:17:31,839
- Again?
- This is no ordinary arrest.

252
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,841
A murderer, no less.

253
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:37,637
If you're thinking of warning him, don't
put yourself out. He cannot escape.

254
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:41,682
- I stick my neck out for nobody.
- A Wise foreign policy.

255
00:17:45,187 --> 00:17:47,897
Could have made the arrest earlier,
at the Blue Parrot.

256
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:50,191
Out of my regard for you,
we're staging it here.

257
00:17:50,192 --> 00:17:52,276
It will amuse your customers.

258
00:17:52,277 --> 00:17:54,904
Our entertainment's enough.

259
00:17:54,905 --> 00:17:57,198
We're to have an important guest
here tonight.

260
00:17:57,199 --> 00:17:59,867
Major Strasser
of the Third Reich, no less.

261
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:02,203
We want him to be here
when we make the arrest.

262
00:18:02,204 --> 00:18:04,956
A demonstration of the efficiency
of my administration.

263
00:18:04,957 --> 00:18:07,083
I see.
And what's Strasser doing here?

264
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:11,170
He certainly didn't come here to Witness
a demonstration of your efficiency.

265
00:18:11,171 --> 00:18:12,463
- Perhaps not.
- Here.

266
00:18:12,464 --> 00:18:14,799
- It shall not happen again.
- That's all right.

267
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,802
Louis, you got something on your mind.
Why don't you spill it.

268
00:18:17,803 --> 00:18:19,637
How observant you are.

269
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:22,473
As a matter of fact,
I wanted to give you a word of advice.

270
00:18:22,474 --> 00:18:23,808
Yeah?

271
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:27,228
- Have a brandy?
- Thank you.

272
00:18:27,229 --> 00:18:29,355
There are many exit visas
sold in this café...

273
00:18:29,356 --> 00:18:31,732
but we know
that you've never sold one.

274
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:34,068
That is the reason
we permit you to remain open.

275
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:36,529
I thought it was because
I let you win at roulette.

276
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,989
That is another reason.

277
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,950
There is a man arrived in Casablanca
on his way to America.

278
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:43,995
He will offer a fortune to anyone
who'll furnish an exit visa.

279
00:18:43,996 --> 00:18:46,872
- What's his name?
- Victor Laszlo.

280
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:48,457
Victor Laszlo?

281
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,210
Rick, that is the first time
I've seen you so impressed.

282
00:18:51,211 --> 00:18:53,379
He's succeeded in impressing
half the world.

283
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:57,008
It's my duty to see that
he doesn't impress the other half.

284
00:18:57,009 --> 00:19:00,303
Laszlo must never reach America.
He stays in Casablanca.

285
00:19:00,304 --> 00:19:02,471
It'll be interesting
to see how he manages.

286
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:04,807
- Manages what?
- His escape.

287
00:19:04,808 --> 00:19:06,851
- But I just told you...
- Stop it.

288
00:19:06,852 --> 00:19:08,853
He escaped from
a concentration camp.

289
00:19:08,854 --> 00:19:10,980
The Nazis have chased him
all over Europe.

290
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:15,026
- This is the end of the Chase.
- Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.

291
00:19:15,027 --> 00:19:16,694
Is that a serious offer?

292
00:19:16,695 --> 00:19:19,196
I just paid out 20,
and I'd like to get it back.

293
00:19:19,197 --> 00:19:22,700
Make it 10.
I'm only a poor corrupt official.

294
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:24,076
- Okay.
- Done.

295
00:19:24,077 --> 00:19:28,539
No matter how clever he is, he still
needs an exit visa. Or I should say two.

296
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,791
- Why two?
- He is traveling with a lady.

297
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:33,794
- He'll take one.
- I think not. I've seen the lady.

298
00:19:33,795 --> 00:19:36,964
And if he did not leave her
in Marseilles or Oran...

299
00:19:36,965 --> 00:19:39,258
he certainly won't leave her
in Casablanca.

300
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:41,594
Maybe he's not quite
as romantic as you are.

301
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:45,473
It doesn't matter.
There is no exit visa for him.

302
00:19:45,474 --> 00:19:49,435
Whatever gave you the impression
that I might help Laszlo escape?

303
00:19:49,436 --> 00:19:52,772
Because, my dear Ricky,
I suspect that under that cynical shell...

304
00:19:52,773 --> 00:19:55,149
you are at heart a sentimentalist.

305
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,319
Laugh if you will, but I happen
to be familiar with your record.

306
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,738
Let me point out just two items:

307
00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:04,909
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.

308
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:09,038
In 1936, you fought in Spain
on the Loyalist side.

309
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,540
And got well paid for it
on both occasions.

310
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,210
The winning side would
have paid you much better.

311
00:20:14,211 --> 00:20:16,295
- Maybe.
- Uh-huh.

312
00:20:16,296 --> 00:20:18,714
It seems you're determined
to keep Laszlo here.

313
00:20:18,715 --> 00:20:21,258
I have my orders.

314
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:23,302
I see. Gestapo spank.

315
00:20:23,303 --> 00:20:26,305
My dear Ricky, you overestimate
the influence of the Gestapo.

316
00:20:26,306 --> 00:20:29,850
I don't interfere with them,
and they don't interfere with me.

317
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:32,103
In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.

318
00:20:32,104 --> 00:20:34,438
- I am...
- Major Strasser is here, sir.

319
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:39,439
- You were saying?
- Excuse me.

320
00:20:46,451 --> 00:20:49,870
Carl, see that Major Strasser
gets a good table, close to the ladies.

321
00:20:49,871 --> 00:20:51,872
I have already given him the best...

322
00:20:51,873 --> 00:20:56,627
knowing he is German
and would take it anyway.

323
00:20:56,628 --> 00:20:58,838
Take him quietly.
Two guards at every door.

324
00:20:58,839 --> 00:20:59,451
Yes, sir.

325
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:09,219
- Everything is ready, sir.
- Go ahead.

326
00:21:12,477 --> 00:21:14,979
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, Captain.

327
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,065
- Won't you join us?
- Thank you.

328
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:21,986
- It's a pleasure to have you here, major.
- Champagne and a tin of Caviar.

329
00:21:21,987 --> 00:21:24,822
May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26,
a good French wine.

330
00:21:24,823 --> 00:21:27,825
- Thank you.
- Very well, sir.

331
00:21:27,826 --> 00:21:31,245
- A very interesting club.
- Especially so tonight, major.

332
00:21:31,246 --> 00:21:34,999
In a few minutes you'll see the arrest
of the man who murdered your couriers.

333
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,792
I expected no less, Captain.

334
00:21:36,793 --> 00:21:38,961
Monsieur Ugarte.

335
00:21:38,962 --> 00:21:41,380
Oh. Yes?

336
00:21:41,381 --> 00:21:45,134
- Will you please come with us?
- Certainly.

337
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:47,636
May I first please cash my chips?

338
00:21:54,102 --> 00:21:59,102
Very lucky, huh?
Two thousand, please.

339
00:22:03,987 --> 00:22:08,987
Thank you.

340
00:22:18,668 --> 00:22:20,836
Rick! Rick, help me!

341
00:22:20,837 --> 00:22:25,837
- Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
- But, Rick, hide me. Do something!

342
00:22:32,557 --> 00:22:34,058
Excellent, Captain.

343
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:36,894
When they come for me,
I hope you'll be more of a help.

344
00:22:36,895 --> 00:22:39,230
I stick my neck out for nobody.

345
00:22:39,231 --> 00:22:43,234
I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks,
but it's all over now.

346
00:22:43,235 --> 00:22:46,362
Just sit down and have a good time.
Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.

347
00:22:46,363 --> 00:22:47,988
Okay, boss.

348
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:54,578
Rick.

349
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:58,207
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser
of the Third Reich.

350
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:00,251
- How do you do, Mr. Rick?
- How do you do?

351
00:23:00,252 --> 00:23:02,586
You already know Herr Heinze
of the Third Reich.

352
00:23:02,587 --> 00:23:07,587
Pleasejoin us, Mr. Rick.

353
00:23:08,677 --> 00:23:10,427
We are very honored tonight.

354
00:23:10,428 --> 00:23:14,765
Major Strasser is one of the reasons the
Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.

355
00:23:14,766 --> 00:23:17,935
You repeat Third Reich as though
you expected there to be others.

356
00:23:17,936 --> 00:23:21,647
Well, personally, major,
I will take what comes.

357
00:23:21,648 --> 00:23:23,941
Do you mind
if I ask you a few questions?

358
00:23:23,942 --> 00:23:26,652
- Unofficially, of course.
- Make it official if you like.

359
00:23:26,653 --> 00:23:30,865
- What is your nationality?
- I'm a drunkard.

360
00:23:30,866 --> 00:23:33,200
And that makes Rick a Citizen
of the world.

361
00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:36,287
I was born in New York City,
if that'll help you any.

362
00:23:36,288 --> 00:23:39,623
I understand you came here from Paris
at the time of the occupation.

363
00:23:39,624 --> 00:23:41,584
There seems to be no secret
about that.

364
00:23:41,585 --> 00:23:43,168
Are you one of those people...

365
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:46,130
who cannot imagine the Germans
in their beloved Paris?

366
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:48,340
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

367
00:23:48,341 --> 00:23:51,343
Can you imagine us in London?

368
00:23:51,344 --> 00:23:53,304
When you get there, ask me.

369
00:23:53,305 --> 00:23:54,638
Diplomatist.

370
00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:55,973
How about New York?

371
00:23:55,974 --> 00:23:58,267
Well, there are
sections of New York, major...

372
00:23:58,268 --> 00:24:00,394
that I wouldn't advise
you to try to invade.

373
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:01,604
Uh-huh.

374
00:24:01,605 --> 00:24:04,440
- Who do you think will win the war?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

375
00:24:04,441 --> 00:24:06,859
Rick is completely neutral
about everything.

376
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,320
And that takes in the field
of women too.

377
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:11,655
You were not always
so carefully neutral.

378
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:15,326
We have a complete dossier on you.

379
00:24:15,327 --> 00:24:20,327
"Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37.
Cannot return to his country."

380
00:24:20,332 --> 00:24:23,500
The reason is a little vague.
We also know what you did in Paris.

381
00:24:23,501 --> 00:24:25,252
And also we know why you left Paris.

382
00:24:25,253 --> 00:24:27,421
Don't worry,
we're not going to broadcast it.

383
00:24:27,422 --> 00:24:28,839
Are my eyes really brown?

384
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,217
You will forgive my curiosity,
Mr. Blaine. The point is...

385
00:24:32,218 --> 00:24:34,637
an enemy of the Reich
has come to Casablanca...

386
00:24:34,638 --> 00:24:37,848
and we are checking up on anybody
who can be of any help to us.

387
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:42,686
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo
stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

388
00:24:42,687 --> 00:24:46,023
In this case you have no sympathy
for the fox?

389
00:24:46,024 --> 00:24:49,735
Not particularly. I understand
the point of view of the hound too.

390
00:24:49,736 --> 00:24:52,821
Laszlo published the foulest lies
in the Prague newspapers...

391
00:24:52,822 --> 00:24:54,573
until the day we marched in.

392
00:24:54,574 --> 00:24:59,119
And even after that, he continued
to print scandal Sheets in his cellar.

393
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,206
Of course, one must admit
he has great Courage.

394
00:25:02,207 --> 00:25:05,376
I admit he's clever. Three times
he slipped through our fingers.

395
00:25:05,377 --> 00:25:09,463
In Paris he continued his activities.
We intend not to let it happen again.

396
00:25:09,464 --> 00:25:13,133
Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business
is politics, mine is running a saloon.

397
00:25:13,134 --> 00:25:15,636
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

398
00:25:15,637 --> 00:25:18,806
You see, major?
You have nothing to worry about Rick.

399
00:25:18,807 --> 00:25:19,351
Perhaps.

400
00:25:23,728 --> 00:25:25,104
Yes, monsieur?

401
00:25:25,105 --> 00:25:30,105
- I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
- Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.

402
00:25:56,136 --> 00:25:59,972
Two Cointreaux, please.

403
00:25:59,973 --> 00:26:02,641
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.

404
00:26:02,642 --> 00:26:05,853
Victor, I feel somehow
we shouldn't stay here.

405
00:26:05,854 --> 00:26:08,939
If we would walk out so soon
it would only call attention to us.

406
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,943
Perhaps Ugarte is in
some other part of the café.

407
00:26:12,944 --> 00:26:15,821
Excuse me, but you look like a couple
who are on their way to America.

408
00:26:15,822 --> 00:26:17,072
Well?

409
00:26:17,073 --> 00:26:21,577
You'll find a market there for this ring.
I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.

410
00:26:21,578 --> 00:26:24,288
- Thank you, but I hardly think...
- Perhaps for the lady.

411
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:27,875
The ring is quite unique.

412
00:26:27,876 --> 00:26:32,087
- Yes, I'm very interested.
- Good.

413
00:26:32,088 --> 00:26:33,338
What is your name?

414
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:35,966
Berger, Norwegian.
At your service, sir.

415
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:37,217
Victor.

416
00:26:37,218 --> 00:26:39,595
I'll meet you in a few minutes
at the bar.

417
00:26:39,596 --> 00:26:42,306
We don't want the ring,
but thanks for showing it to us.

418
00:26:42,307 --> 00:26:44,600
Such a bargain.
But that is your decision?

419
00:26:44,601 --> 00:26:48,187
I'm sorry, it is.

420
00:26:48,188 --> 00:26:50,522
- Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
- Yes?

421
00:26:50,523 --> 00:26:52,691
I am Captain Renault,
prefect of police.

422
00:26:52,692 --> 00:26:54,068
Yes, what is it you want?

423
00:26:54,069 --> 00:26:57,362
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca
and wish you a pleasant stay.

424
00:26:57,363 --> 00:27:00,282
It isn't often we have
so distinguished a visitor.

425
00:27:00,283 --> 00:27:02,910
Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me, Captain.

426
00:27:02,911 --> 00:27:06,622
The present French administration
hasn't always been so cordial.

427
00:27:06,623 --> 00:27:10,250
May I present Miss Ilsa Lund.

428
00:27:10,251 --> 00:27:13,337
I was told you were the most beautiful
woman ever to visit Casablanca.

429
00:27:13,338 --> 00:27:15,589
That was a gross understatement.

430
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,840
You're very kind.

431
00:27:16,841 --> 00:27:19,635
- Won't you join us?
- If you will permit me.

432
00:27:19,636 --> 00:27:22,971
Oh, no, Emile, please. A bottle of your
best champagne. And put it on my bill.

433
00:27:22,972 --> 00:27:25,974
- Captain, please.
- It's a game we play.

434
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:29,937
They put it on the bill,
I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.

435
00:27:29,938 --> 00:27:33,398
Captain,
the boy Who's playing the piano...

436
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:35,067
Somewhere I've seen him.

437
00:27:35,068 --> 00:27:36,777
- Sam?
- Yes.

438
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:38,695
He came from Paris with Rick.

439
00:27:38,696 --> 00:27:40,322
Rick? Who is he?

440
00:27:40,323 --> 00:27:43,075
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's.
Rick is...

441
00:27:43,076 --> 00:27:44,785
- Is what?
- Mademoiselle...

442
00:27:44,786 --> 00:27:47,579
he's the kind of man that,
well, if I were a woman...

443
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,290
and I were not around,
I should be in love with Rick.

444
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:55,254
But what a fool I am talking to a
beautiful woman about another man.

445
00:27:55,255 --> 00:27:56,463
Excuse me.

446
00:27:56,464 --> 00:27:59,842
Major.

447
00:27:59,843 --> 00:28:03,137
Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo,
may I present Major Strasser.

448
00:28:03,138 --> 00:28:04,346
How do you do?

449
00:28:04,347 --> 00:28:06,557
This is a pleasure
I have looked forward to.

450
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:09,226
I'm sure you'll excuse me
if I'm not gracious.

451
00:28:09,227 --> 00:28:11,645
You see, Major Strasser,
I am a Czechoslovakian.

452
00:28:11,646 --> 00:28:16,646
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now
you are a subject of the German Reich.

453
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:20,529
I have never accepted that privilege.
And I'm now on French soil.

454
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:24,449
I'd like to discuss some matters arising
from your presence on French soil.

455
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,285
This is hardly the time or place.

456
00:28:26,286 --> 00:28:28,620
Then we shall state
another time and place.

457
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:30,914
Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.

458
00:28:30,915 --> 00:28:33,750
With mademoiselle.

459
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:37,004
Captain, I am under your authority.

460
00:28:37,005 --> 00:28:39,256
Is it your order
that we come to your office?

461
00:28:39,257 --> 00:28:43,343
Let us say it is my request.
That is a much more pleasant word.

462
00:28:43,344 --> 00:28:45,304
- Very well.
- Mademoiselle.

463
00:28:45,305 --> 00:28:48,807
Mademoiselle.

464
00:28:48,808 --> 00:28:52,311
A very clever tactical retreat, major.

465
00:28:52,312 --> 00:28:56,565
- This time they really mean to stop me.
- Victor, I'm afraid for you.

466
00:28:56,566 --> 00:29:00,402
We've been in difficult places before,
haven't we?

467
00:29:32,518 --> 00:29:34,645
I must find out what Berger knows.

468
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:39,646
- Be careful.
- I will. Don't worry.

469
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:58,043
Monsieur Berger, the ring.
Could I see it again?

470
00:29:58,044 --> 00:29:59,253
- Yes.
- Monsieur?

471
00:29:59,254 --> 00:30:01,380
Champagne cocktail, please.

472
00:30:01,381 --> 00:30:04,299
I recognize you from the news
photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.

473
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,427
In a concentration camp,
one is apt to lose a little weight.

474
00:30:07,428 --> 00:30:10,639
We read five times that you were killed
in five different places.

475
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,684
As you see,
it was true every single time.

476
00:30:13,685 --> 00:30:15,352
Thank heaven I found you, Berger.

477
00:30:15,353 --> 00:30:19,564
I'm looking for a man by the name of
Ugarte. He's supposed to help me.

478
00:30:19,565 --> 00:30:22,025
Ugarte cannot even help himself.

479
00:30:22,026 --> 00:30:26,863
He's under arrest for murder.
He was arrested here tonight.

480
00:30:26,864 --> 00:30:28,490
I see.

481
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:32,703
But we who are still free will do
all we can. We are organized.

482
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,122
Underground, like everywhere else.

483
00:30:35,123 --> 00:30:38,292
Tomorrow night there is a meeting
at the Caverne du Bois.

484
00:30:38,293 --> 00:30:39,626
If you will come...

485
00:30:39,627 --> 00:30:44,627
Monsieur.

486
00:30:53,433 --> 00:30:55,934
Will you ask the piano player
to come over here?

487
00:30:55,935 --> 00:31:00,230
Very well, mademoiselle.

488
00:31:00,231 --> 00:31:03,734
- How's the jewelry business, Berger?
- Not so good. Check, please.

489
00:31:03,735 --> 00:31:05,444
Too bad you weren't here earlier.

490
00:31:05,445 --> 00:31:08,155
We had quite a bit of excitement,
didn't we, Berger?

491
00:31:08,156 --> 00:31:09,781
Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.

492
00:31:09,782 --> 00:31:14,782
- My bill.
- No. Two champagne Cocktails. Please.

493
00:31:17,915 --> 00:31:20,417
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Miss Ilsa.

494
00:31:20,418 --> 00:31:23,420
I never expected to see you again.

495
00:31:23,421 --> 00:31:25,422
It's been a long time.

496
00:31:25,423 --> 00:31:30,344
Yes, ma'am.
A lot of water under the bridge.

497
00:31:30,345 --> 00:31:35,345
- Some of the old songs, Sam.
- Yes, ma'am.

498
00:31:43,316 --> 00:31:44,983
Where is Rick?

499
00:31:44,984 --> 00:31:48,445
I don't know.
I ain't seen him all night.

500
00:31:48,446 --> 00:31:51,990
- When will he be back?
- Not tonight no more. He ain't coming...

501
00:31:51,991 --> 00:31:55,285
He went home.

502
00:31:55,286 --> 00:31:58,288
- Does he always leave so early?
- Oh, he never...

503
00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:00,874
Well, he's got a girl
up to the Blue Parrot.

504
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:04,544
Goes up there all the time.

505
00:32:04,545 --> 00:32:08,131
You used to be
a much better liar, Sam.

506
00:32:08,132 --> 00:32:13,132
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa.
You're bad luck to him.

507
00:32:14,305 --> 00:32:17,474
Play it once, Sam.
For old times' sake.

508
00:32:17,475 --> 00:32:20,477
I don't know what you mean,
Miss Ilsa.

509
00:32:20,478 --> 00:32:22,979
Play it, Sam.

510
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,399
Play "As Time Goes By."

511
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,444
I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa.
I'm a little rusty on it.

512
00:32:29,445 --> 00:32:32,197
I'll hum it for you.

513
00:32:43,084 --> 00:32:47,003
Sing it, Sam.

514
00:32:48,381 --> 00:32:50,215
<i>You must remember this.</i>

515
00:32:50,216 --> 00:32:53,260
<i>A kiss is just a kiss.</i>

516
00:32:53,261 --> 00:32:58,261
<i>A sigh is just a sigh.</i>

517
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:03,353
<i>The fundamental things apply.</i>

518
00:33:03,354 --> 00:33:08,354
<i>As time goes by.</i>

519
00:33:10,653 --> 00:33:13,530
<i>And when two lovers WOO.</i>

520
00:33:13,531 --> 00:33:16,450
<i>They still say, "I love you".</i>

521
00:33:16,451 --> 00:33:21,451
<i>On that you can rely.</i>

522
00:33:22,331 --> 00:33:26,835
<i>No matter what the future brings.</i>

523
00:33:26,836 --> 00:33:30,547
<i>As time goes by</i>

524
00:33:30,548 --> 00:33:35,548
Sam, I thought I told you
never to play...

525
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:47,230
Well, you were asking about Rick,
and here he is. May I present...

526
00:33:47,231 --> 00:33:49,733
- Hello, Ilsa.
- Hello, Rick.

527
00:33:49,734 --> 00:33:53,403
Oh, you've already met Rick,
mademoiselle? Then perhaps you also...

528
00:33:53,404 --> 00:33:54,946
This is Mr. Laszlo.

529
00:33:54,947 --> 00:33:56,740
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

530
00:33:56,741 --> 00:33:59,159
One hears a great deal about Rick
in Casablanca.

531
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,161
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.

532
00:34:01,162 --> 00:34:03,455
- Won't you join us for a drink?
- Rick never...

533
00:34:03,456 --> 00:34:05,499
- Thanks, I Will.
- Well...

534
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,252
a precedent is being broken. Emile.

535
00:34:09,253 --> 00:34:12,923
- Interesting café. I congratulate you.
- I congratulate you.

536
00:34:12,924 --> 00:34:14,591
- What for?
- Your work.

537
00:34:14,592 --> 00:34:17,219
Thank you. I try.

538
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,346
We all try. You succeed.

539
00:34:19,347 --> 00:34:21,765
She was asking about you
earlier, Rick...

540
00:34:21,766 --> 00:34:25,060
in a way that made me
extremely jealous.

541
00:34:25,061 --> 00:34:27,312
I wasn't sure you were the same.

542
00:34:27,313 --> 00:34:31,775
- Let's see, the last time we met...
- Was La Belle Aurore.

543
00:34:31,776 --> 00:34:33,860
How nice. You remembered.

544
00:34:33,861 --> 00:34:36,863
But, of course, that was the day
the Germans marched into Paris.

545
00:34:36,864 --> 00:34:39,783
- Not an easy day to forget.
- No.

546
00:34:39,784 --> 00:34:44,784
I remember every detail.
The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.

547
00:34:44,956 --> 00:34:47,749
Yes. I put that dress away.

548
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,293
When the Germans march out
I'll wear it again.

549
00:34:50,294 --> 00:34:54,798
Ricky, you're becoming quite human.
I suppose we have to thank you for that.

550
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:58,218
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one
to say it, but it's late.

551
00:34:58,219 --> 00:35:01,054
So it is.
We have a curfew in Casablanca.

552
00:35:01,055 --> 00:35:04,766
It would never do for the Chief of police
to be found drinking after hours.

553
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:06,560
I hope we didn't
overstay our welcome.

554
00:35:06,561 --> 00:35:07,894
Not at all.

555
00:35:07,895 --> 00:35:09,688
- Your check, sir.
- It's my party.

556
00:35:09,689 --> 00:35:13,483
Another precedent gone.
This has been a very interesting evening.

557
00:35:13,484 --> 00:35:17,571
I'll call you a cab.
Gasoline rationing, time of night.

558
00:35:17,572 --> 00:35:19,489
- We'll come again.
- Anytime.

559
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:22,534
- Say good night to Sam for me.
- I will.

560
00:35:22,535 --> 00:35:27,122
There's still nobody in the world who
can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.

561
00:35:27,123 --> 00:35:31,084
He hasn't played it in a long time.

562
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:33,211
- Good night.
- Good night.

563
00:35:33,212 --> 00:35:33,712
Night.

564
00:35:42,722 --> 00:35:45,432
A very puzzling fellow, this Rick.
What sort is he?

565
00:35:45,433 --> 00:35:48,852
I really can't say,
though I saw him quite often in Paris.

566
00:35:48,853 --> 00:35:51,563
- Tomorrow at 10, at the prefect office.
- We'll be there.

567
00:35:51,564 --> 00:35:56,564
- Good night.
- Good night.

568
00:36:32,104 --> 00:36:32,604
Boss?

569
00:36:37,276 --> 00:36:39,736
- Boss?
- Yeah?

570
00:36:39,737 --> 00:36:42,989
- Boss, ain't you going to bed?
- Not right now.

571
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,949
Ain't you planning to go to bed
in the near future?

572
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,201
No.

573
00:36:46,202 --> 00:36:49,079
- You ever going to bed?
- No.

574
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,081
Well, I ain't sleepy, either.

575
00:36:51,082 --> 00:36:52,457
Good, then have a drink.

576
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:54,584
- Not me, boss.
- Then don't have a drink.

577
00:36:54,585 --> 00:36:56,336
Boss, let's get out of here.

578
00:36:56,337 --> 00:36:59,047
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.

579
00:36:59,048 --> 00:37:01,841
Please, let's go.
Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.

580
00:37:01,842 --> 00:37:03,968
She's coming back.
I know she's coming back.

581
00:37:03,969 --> 00:37:05,887
We'll take the car and drive all night.

582
00:37:05,888 --> 00:37:08,890
We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing,
stay away until she's gone.

583
00:37:08,891 --> 00:37:13,891
- Shut up and go home, will you?
- No, sir, I'm staying right here.

584
00:37:18,776 --> 00:37:21,528
They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.

585
00:37:21,529 --> 00:37:25,115
Well, that's the way it goes.
One in, one out.

586
00:37:26,325 --> 00:37:28,952
Sam. SAM: Yes, boss?

587
00:37:28,953 --> 00:37:33,623
If it's December 1941 in Casablanca,
what time is it in New York?

588
00:37:33,624 --> 00:37:35,083
What?

589
00:37:35,084 --> 00:37:37,377
My watch stopped.

590
00:37:37,378 --> 00:37:39,796
I bet they're asleep in New York.

591
00:37:39,797 --> 00:37:44,797
I bet they're asleep all over America.

592
00:37:49,306 --> 00:37:53,643
Of all the gin joints in all the towns
in all the world...

593
00:37:53,644 --> 00:37:58,644
she walks into mine.

594
00:38:03,112 --> 00:38:06,030
- What's that you're playing?
- A little something of my own.

595
00:38:06,031 --> 00:38:08,992
- Stop it. You know what I want to hear.
- No, I don't.

596
00:38:08,993 --> 00:38:11,327
You played it for her.
You can play it for me.

597
00:38:11,328 --> 00:38:14,706
- I don't think I can remember...
- If she can stand it, I can.

598
00:38:14,707 --> 00:38:16,833
Play it.

599
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:19,878
Yes, boss.

600
00:39:48,008 --> 00:39:51,010
Who are you really?
And what were you before?

601
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:53,596
What did you do,
and what did you think?

602
00:39:53,597 --> 00:39:58,597
We said no questions.

603
00:40:00,229 --> 00:40:05,229
Here's looking at you, kid.

604
00:40:36,223 --> 00:40:38,141
A franc for your thoughts.

605
00:40:38,142 --> 00:40:41,019
In America they'd bring only a penny.

606
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,105
I guess that's about all they're worth.

607
00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:48,610
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.

608
00:40:48,611 --> 00:40:50,778
Well, I was wondering...

609
00:40:50,779 --> 00:40:52,071
Yes?

610
00:40:52,072 --> 00:40:57,072
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should
find you waiting for me to come along.

611
00:40:57,536 --> 00:41:02,081
- Why there is no other man in my life?
- Uh-huh.

612
00:41:02,082 --> 00:41:06,336
That's easy. There was.

613
00:41:06,337 --> 00:41:08,755
He's dead.

614
00:41:08,756 --> 00:41:11,341
I'm sorry for asking.

615
00:41:11,342 --> 00:41:15,762
I forgot we said no questions.

616
00:41:15,763 --> 00:41:20,763
Well, only one answer can
take care of all our questions.

617
00:42:05,938 --> 00:42:10,149
Nothing can stop them now. Wednesday,
Thursday at the latest, they'll be in Paris.

618
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:13,236
Richard, they'll find out your record.
You won't be safe here.

619
00:42:13,237 --> 00:42:18,237
I'm on their blacklist already.
Their roll of honor.

620
00:42:20,703 --> 00:42:23,746
<i>Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date.</i>

621
00:42:23,747 --> 00:42:28,747
<i>Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate.</i>

622
00:42:28,961 --> 00:42:33,961
<i>Woman needs man
And man must have his mate.</i>

623
00:42:34,341 --> 00:42:39,341
<i>That no one can deny.</i>

624
00:42:40,055 --> 00:42:42,849
<i>It's still the same old story.</i>

625
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:45,476
<i>A fight for love and glory.</i>

626
00:42:45,477 --> 00:42:50,477
<i>A case of do or die.</i>

627
00:42:51,066 --> 00:42:56,066
<i>The world will always welcome /overs.</i>

628
00:42:56,864 --> 00:43:01,864
<i>As time goes by</i>

629
00:43:02,286 --> 00:43:05,038
Henri wants us to finish this bottle
and then three more.

630
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:07,123
Says he'll water his garden
with champagne...

631
00:43:07,124 --> 00:43:09,042
before he'll let the Germans drink it.

632
00:43:09,043 --> 00:43:12,545
This sort of takes the sting out
of being occupied, doesn't it?

633
00:43:12,546 --> 00:43:13,963
You said it.

634
00:43:13,964 --> 00:43:18,964
Here's looking at you, kid.

635
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,454
My German's a little rusty.

636
00:43:46,455 --> 00:43:49,999
It's the Gestapo.

637
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,003
They say they expect to be
in Paris tomorrow.

638
00:43:54,004 --> 00:43:59,004
They're telling us how to act
when they come marching in.

639
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:03,930
With the whole world crumbling,
we pick this time to fall in love.

640
00:44:03,931 --> 00:44:05,848
It's pretty bad timing.

641
00:44:05,849 --> 00:44:10,849
- Where were you, say, 10 years ago?
- 10 years ago?

642
00:44:11,146 --> 00:44:12,814
Let's see.

643
00:44:12,815 --> 00:44:17,360
Yes, I was having a brace put
on my teeth. Where were you?

644
00:44:17,361 --> 00:44:20,905
Looking for a job.

645
00:44:25,536 --> 00:44:28,079
Was that Cannon fire?

646
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,705
Or is it my heart pounding?

647
00:44:29,706 --> 00:44:34,706
It's the new German 77th, and judging
by the sound, only about 35 miles away.

648
00:44:36,046 --> 00:44:39,382
And getting closer every minute.

649
00:44:39,383 --> 00:44:41,384
Here, here, drink up.

650
00:44:41,385 --> 00:44:43,302
We'll never finish the other three.

651
00:44:43,303 --> 00:44:46,889
Them Germans will be here pretty soon,
and they'll come looking for you.

652
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,225
And don't forget,
there's a price on your head.

653
00:44:49,226 --> 00:44:52,728
I left a note in my apartment.
They'll know where to find me.

654
00:44:52,729 --> 00:44:54,772
It's strange.

655
00:44:54,773 --> 00:44:58,818
- I know so very little about you.
- I know very little about you.

656
00:44:58,819 --> 00:45:02,488
Just the fact that
you had your teeth straightened.

657
00:45:02,489 --> 00:45:05,575
Be serious, darling. You are in danger.
You must leave Paris.

658
00:45:05,576 --> 00:45:07,618
No, we must leave.

659
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:09,287
Yes, of course. We.

660
00:45:09,288 --> 00:45:13,040
The train for Marseilles leaves at 5:00.
I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.

661
00:45:13,041 --> 00:45:17,295
No, no. Not at my hotel. I...

662
00:45:17,296 --> 00:45:20,590
I have things to do in the city
before I leave.

663
00:45:20,591 --> 00:45:22,508
I'll meet you at the station.

664
00:45:22,509 --> 00:45:24,886
All right, at a quarter to 5.

665
00:45:24,887 --> 00:45:29,887
Why don't we get married
in Marseilles?

666
00:45:31,393 --> 00:45:33,269
That's too far ahead to plan.

667
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:36,272
Yes. I guess it is too far ahead.

668
00:45:36,273 --> 00:45:39,317
Let's seem. What about the engineer?
Why can't he marry us on the train?

669
00:45:39,318 --> 00:45:40,526
Oh, darling...

670
00:45:40,527 --> 00:45:44,780
Why not? The Captain on a ship can.
It doesn't seem fair that...

671
00:45:44,781 --> 00:45:46,407
Hey...

672
00:45:46,408 --> 00:45:51,408
Hey, what's wrong, kid?

673
00:45:54,082 --> 00:45:58,461
I love you so much.

674
00:45:58,462 --> 00:46:02,882
And I hate this war so much.

675
00:46:02,883 --> 00:46:07,261
It's a crazy world.
Anything can happen.

676
00:46:07,262 --> 00:46:09,388
If you shouldn't get away...

677
00:46:09,389 --> 00:46:10,973
I mean if...

678
00:46:10,974 --> 00:46:14,227
If something should keep us apart...

679
00:46:14,228 --> 00:46:16,312
wherever they put you...

680
00:46:16,313 --> 00:46:21,313
and wherever I'll be,
I want you to know that I...

681
00:46:25,155 --> 00:46:26,822
Kiss me.

682
00:46:26,823 --> 00:46:31,823
Kiss me as if it were the last time.

683
00:46:54,726 --> 00:46:59,726
All aboard! The last train
leaving in three minutes.

684
00:47:05,737 --> 00:47:07,363
Where is she? Have you seen her?

685
00:47:07,364 --> 00:47:10,116
I can't find her.
She checked out of the hotel.

686
00:47:10,117 --> 00:47:15,117
But this note came just after you left.

687
00:47:27,342 --> 00:47:29,802
That's the last call, Mr. Richard.

688
00:47:29,803 --> 00:47:32,013
Do you hear me?

689
00:47:32,014 --> 00:47:37,014
Come on, Mr. Richard.
Let's get out of here. Come on.

690
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:29,779
- Rick, I have to talk to you.
- Uh-huh.

691
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:33,783
I saved my first drink
to have with you. Here.

692
00:48:33,784 --> 00:48:37,870
- No, Rick. Not tonight.
- Especially tonight.

693
00:48:37,871 --> 00:48:41,624
Why did you have to come to
Casablanca? There are other places.

694
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:44,710
I wouldn't have come
if I'd known you were here.

695
00:48:44,711 --> 00:48:46,837
Believe me, Rick, it's true.
I didn't know.

696
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:50,424
It's funny about your voice,
how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it.

697
00:48:50,425 --> 00:48:52,968
"Richard, dear,
I'll go with you anyplace.

698
00:48:52,969 --> 00:48:57,264
- "We'll get on a train and never stop."
- Don't, Rick.

699
00:48:57,265 --> 00:48:59,934
I can understand how you feel.

700
00:48:59,935 --> 00:49:02,812
You understand how I feel.

701
00:49:02,813 --> 00:49:05,481
How long was it we had, honey?

702
00:49:05,482 --> 00:49:07,983
- I didn't count the days.
- Well, I did.

703
00:49:07,984 --> 00:49:10,069
Every one of them.

704
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:12,988
Mostly I remember the last one.

705
00:49:12,989 --> 00:49:16,909
The wild finish. A guy standing
on a station platform in the rain...

706
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:18,828
with a comical look on his face...

707
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:22,832
because his insides
have been kicked out.

708
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:25,167
Can I tell you a story, Rick?

709
00:49:25,168 --> 00:49:27,837
Does it got a wild finish?

710
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:30,172
I don't know the finish yet.

711
00:49:30,173 --> 00:49:35,173
Go on, tell it. Maybe one'll come
to you as you go along.

712
00:49:36,054 --> 00:49:40,015
It's about a girl who had just come
to Paris from her home in Oslo.

713
00:49:40,016 --> 00:49:41,892
At the house of some friends...

714
00:49:41,893 --> 00:49:44,937
she met a man about whom
she'd heard her whole life.

715
00:49:44,938 --> 00:49:48,524
A very great and courageous man.

716
00:49:48,525 --> 00:49:50,985
He opened up for her a whole
beautiful world...

717
00:49:50,986 --> 00:49:53,988
full of knowledge
and thoughts and ideals.

718
00:49:53,989 --> 00:49:58,033
Everything she knew
or ever became was because of him.

719
00:49:58,034 --> 00:50:00,035
And she looked up to him...

720
00:50:00,036 --> 00:50:01,704
and worshiped him...

721
00:50:01,705 --> 00:50:04,707
with a feeling
she supposed was love.

722
00:50:04,708 --> 00:50:07,001
Yes, that's very pretty.

723
00:50:07,002 --> 00:50:10,880
I heard a story once. In fact,
I've heard a lot of stories in my time.

724
00:50:10,881 --> 00:50:13,841
They went along with the sound
of a tinny piano...

725
00:50:13,842 --> 00:50:16,635
playing in the parlor downstairs.

726
00:50:16,636 --> 00:50:21,636
"Mister, I met a man once
when I was a kid," they'd always begin.

727
00:50:23,977 --> 00:50:27,897
I guess neither one of our stories
is very funny.

728
00:50:27,898 --> 00:50:29,940
Tell me...

729
00:50:29,941 --> 00:50:32,234
who was it you left me for?

730
00:50:32,235 --> 00:50:35,779
Was it Laszlo,
or were there others in between...

731
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:40,780
or aren't you the kind that tells?

732
00:51:03,433 --> 00:51:07,186
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the
letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.

733
00:51:07,187 --> 00:51:09,730
I would suggest you search
the café immediately.

734
00:51:09,731 --> 00:51:13,025
If Rick has the letters, he's too smart
to let you find them there.

735
00:51:13,026 --> 00:51:15,236
You give him credit
for too much cleverness.

736
00:51:15,237 --> 00:51:17,988
My impression was he's just
another blundering American.

737
00:51:17,989 --> 00:51:20,241
We mustn't underestimate
American blundering.

738
00:51:20,242 --> 00:51:24,328
I was with them when they blundered
into Berlin in 1918.

739
00:51:24,329 --> 00:51:27,414
As to Laszlo,
we want him watched 24 hours a day.

740
00:51:27,415 --> 00:51:32,415
It may interest you to know that at
this very moment he's on his way here.

741
00:51:36,299 --> 00:51:39,969
There is nothing we can do.

742
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:42,763
I'm delighted to see you.
Did you have a good night's rest?

743
00:51:42,764 --> 00:51:43,973
I slept very well.

744
00:51:43,974 --> 00:51:47,851
Strange. Nobody's supposed
to sleep well in Casablanca.

745
00:51:47,852 --> 00:51:50,312
- May we proceed?
- With pleasure. Won't you sit down?

746
00:51:50,313 --> 00:51:53,941
Thank you.

747
00:51:53,942 --> 00:51:57,486
Laszlo, we will not mince words.
You're an escaped prisoner of the Reich.

748
00:51:57,487 --> 00:52:00,281
So far you have been fortunate
in eluding us.

749
00:52:00,282 --> 00:52:02,032
You have reached Casablanca.

750
00:52:02,033 --> 00:52:04,994
It is my duty to see
that you stay in Casablanca.

751
00:52:04,995 --> 00:52:07,246
Whether or not you will succeed
is problematic.

752
00:52:07,247 --> 00:52:10,165
Not at all. Renault's signature
is necessary on every visa.

753
00:52:10,166 --> 00:52:13,043
Captain, is it possible that Laszlo
will receive a visa?

754
00:52:13,044 --> 00:52:15,629
I'm afraid not. My regrets, monsieur.

755
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:18,257
Well, perhaps I shall like it
in Casablanca.

756
00:52:18,258 --> 00:52:20,134
And mademoiselle?

757
00:52:20,135 --> 00:52:23,846
- You needn't be concerned about me.
- Is that all you wish to tell us?

758
00:52:23,847 --> 00:52:26,932
Don't be in such a hurry.
You have all the time in the world.

759
00:52:26,933 --> 00:52:29,768
You may be
in Casablanca indefinitely.

760
00:52:29,769 --> 00:52:31,854
Or you may leave
for Lisbon tomorrow.

761
00:52:31,855 --> 00:52:34,356
- On one condition.
- And that is?

762
00:52:34,357 --> 00:52:37,735
You know the leader of the Underground
movement in Paris, in Prague...

763
00:52:37,736 --> 00:52:39,278
Brussels, Amsterdam...

764
00:52:39,279 --> 00:52:41,739
Oslo, Belgrade, Athens...

765
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:44,491
- Even Berlin.
- Yes, even in Berlin.

766
00:52:44,492 --> 00:52:47,286
If you will furnish me with their names
and whereabouts...

767
00:52:47,287 --> 00:52:49,330
you'll have your visa in the morning.

768
00:52:49,331 --> 00:52:52,708
And the honor of having served
the Third Reich.

769
00:52:52,709 --> 00:52:55,377
I was in a German concentration camp
for a year.

770
00:52:55,378 --> 00:53:00,378
- That's honor enough for a lifetime.
- You will give us the names?

771
00:53:00,383 --> 00:53:03,093
If I didn't give them to you
in a concentration camp...

772
00:53:03,094 --> 00:53:06,221
where you had more persuasive
methods at your disposal...

773
00:53:06,222 --> 00:53:09,266
I certainly won't
give them to you now.

774
00:53:09,267 --> 00:53:11,852
And what if you track down
these men and kill them?

775
00:53:11,853 --> 00:53:13,562
What if you murdered all of us?

776
00:53:13,563 --> 00:53:18,067
From every corner of Europe, hundreds,
thousands would rise to take our places.

777
00:53:18,068 --> 00:53:20,569
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.

778
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:24,281
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for
eloquence which I can now understand.

779
00:53:24,282 --> 00:53:26,075
But in one aspect you are mistaken.

780
00:53:26,076 --> 00:53:28,786
You said the enemies
of the Reich could all be replaced.

781
00:53:28,787 --> 00:53:30,537
But there is one exception.

782
00:53:30,538 --> 00:53:33,290
No one could take your place
if anything unfortunate...

783
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:36,585
should occur to you
while you were trying to escape.

784
00:53:36,586 --> 00:53:39,088
You won't dare
to interfere with me here.

785
00:53:39,089 --> 00:53:41,090
This is still unoccupied France.

786
00:53:41,091 --> 00:53:44,093
Any violation of neutrality
would reflect on Captain Renault.

787
00:53:44,094 --> 00:53:46,970
- Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power.
- Thank you.

788
00:53:46,971 --> 00:53:51,517
By the way, monsieur, last night
you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.

789
00:53:51,518 --> 00:53:55,771
- Yes?
- I believe you have a message for him?

790
00:53:55,772 --> 00:53:58,565
Nothing important.
But may I speak to him now?

791
00:53:58,566 --> 00:54:01,777
You would find the conversation
a trifle one-sided.

792
00:54:01,778 --> 00:54:06,778
Signor Ugarte is dead.

793
00:54:10,245 --> 00:54:11,912
I'm making out the report now.

794
00:54:11,913 --> 00:54:15,165
We haven't quite decided
whether he committed suicide...

795
00:54:15,166 --> 00:54:18,669
or died trying to escape.

796
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:21,588
- Are you quite finished with us?
- For the time being.

797
00:54:21,589 --> 00:54:22,201
Good day.

798
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:30,264
Undoubtedly, their next step will
be to the black market.

799
00:54:30,265 --> 00:54:31,515
Excuse me, Captain.

800
00:54:31,516 --> 00:54:34,977
Another visa problem has come up.

801
00:54:34,978 --> 00:54:39,978
- Show her in.
- Yes, sir.

802
00:54:46,573 --> 00:54:49,783
Sorry, monsieur, we were never
to handle the police.

803
00:54:49,784 --> 00:54:52,703
- This is a job for Signor Ferrari.
- Ferrari?

804
00:54:52,704 --> 00:54:55,080
It can be most helpful
to know Signor Ferrari.

805
00:54:55,081 --> 00:54:57,916
He pretty near has a monopoly
on the black market here.

806
00:54:57,917 --> 00:55:00,669
You will find him at the Blue Parrot.

807
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:05,670
Thanks.

808
00:55:14,184 --> 00:55:15,768
Don't be too downhearted.

809
00:55:15,769 --> 00:55:18,020
Perhaps you can
come to terms with Renault.

810
00:55:18,021 --> 00:55:19,521
Thank you very much, signor.

811
00:55:19,522 --> 00:55:22,107
- Hello, Ferrari.
- Good morning, Rick.

812
00:55:22,108 --> 00:55:24,485
The bus is in.
I'll take my shipment with me.

813
00:55:24,486 --> 00:55:26,695
I'll have it sent over.
Have a drink with me.

814
00:55:26,696 --> 00:55:28,155
I never drink in the morning.

815
00:55:28,156 --> 00:55:31,074
And every time you send my
shipment over it's a little short.

816
00:55:31,075 --> 00:55:33,202
Carrying Charges, my boy.
Carrying Charges.

817
00:55:33,203 --> 00:55:34,703
Here, sit down.

818
00:55:34,704 --> 00:55:37,539
There is something I want
to talk over with you, anyhow.

819
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,416
Bourbon.

820
00:55:39,417 --> 00:55:41,543
The news about Ugarte
upsets me very much.

821
00:55:41,544 --> 00:55:45,130
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel
any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.

822
00:55:45,131 --> 00:55:48,091
Of course not. What upsets me
is that Ugarte is dead...

823
00:55:48,092 --> 00:55:50,302
and no one knows where
those letters are.

824
00:55:50,303 --> 00:55:51,804
Practically no one.

825
00:55:51,805 --> 00:55:54,348
If I had those letters,
I could make a fortune.

826
00:55:54,349 --> 00:55:56,600
So could I,
and I'm a poor businessman.

827
00:55:56,601 --> 00:55:59,061
I have a proposition
for whoever has those letters.

828
00:55:59,062 --> 00:56:00,771
I'll handle the entire transaction.

829
00:56:00,772 --> 00:56:03,690
Get rid of the letters, take all the risk,
for a small percentage.

830
00:56:03,691 --> 00:56:05,359
And the carrying Charges?

831
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,821
Naturally there will be a few
incidental expenses.

832
00:56:08,822 --> 00:56:11,406
That's my proposition
for whoever has those letters.

833
00:56:11,407 --> 00:56:13,116
I'll tell him when he comes in.

834
00:56:13,117 --> 00:56:16,036
Rick, I think you know
where those letters are.

835
00:56:16,037 --> 00:56:21,037
You're in good company. Renault
and Strasser probably think so too.

836
00:56:24,921 --> 00:56:28,131
That's why I came here. To give
them a Chance to ransack my place.

837
00:56:28,132 --> 00:56:31,635
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into
your confidence. You need a partner.

838
00:56:31,636 --> 00:56:36,636
Excuse me, I'll be getting back.

839
00:56:37,141 --> 00:56:38,350
Morning.

840
00:56:38,351 --> 00:56:43,351
Signor Ferrari
is the fat gent at the table.

841
00:56:45,608 --> 00:56:48,443
You will not find a treasure
like this in all Morocco.

842
00:56:48,444 --> 00:56:49,945
Only 700 francs.

843
00:56:49,946 --> 00:56:53,282
- You're being cheated.
- Doesn't matter, thank you.

844
00:56:53,283 --> 00:56:56,618
For friends of Rick's
we have a small discount.

845
00:56:56,619 --> 00:56:59,288
Did I say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.

846
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:03,083
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive
you when you called on me last night.

847
00:57:03,084 --> 00:57:04,293
Doesn't matter.

848
00:57:04,294 --> 00:57:08,422
For special friends of Rick's
we have a special discount. 100 francs.

849
00:57:08,423 --> 00:57:11,633
Your story had me a little Confused.
Or maybe it was the bourbon.

850
00:57:11,634 --> 00:57:13,427
I have some tablecloths, napkins...

851
00:57:13,428 --> 00:57:16,305
- Thank you. I'm really not interested.
- Please, one minute.

852
00:57:16,306 --> 00:57:20,100
Why did you come back? To tell me why
you ran out on me at the railway station?

853
00:57:20,101 --> 00:57:21,310
Yes.

854
00:57:21,311 --> 00:57:23,896
Well, you can tell me now.
I'm reasonably sober.

855
00:57:23,897 --> 00:57:25,606
I don't think I Will, Rick.

856
00:57:25,607 --> 00:57:28,317
Why not? After all, I got stuck with
a railway ticket.

857
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:30,068
I think I'm entitled to know.

858
00:57:30,069 --> 00:57:32,946
Last night I saw
what has happened to you.

859
00:57:32,947 --> 00:57:36,325
The Rick I knew in Paris,
I could tell him, he'd understand.

860
00:57:36,326 --> 00:57:40,454
But the one who looked at me
with such hatred...

861
00:57:40,455 --> 00:57:44,625
I'll be leaving Casablanca soon.
We'll never see each other again.

862
00:57:44,626 --> 00:57:48,837
We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris.

863
00:57:48,838 --> 00:57:50,297
If we leave it that way...

864
00:57:50,298 --> 00:57:54,134
maybe we'll remember
those days and not Casablanca.

865
00:57:54,135 --> 00:57:55,928
Not last night.

866
00:57:55,929 --> 00:57:59,348
Did you run out on me because
you knew what it would be like?

867
00:57:59,349 --> 00:58:02,392
Hiding from the police,
running away all the time?

868
00:58:02,393 --> 00:58:04,311
You can believe that if you want to.

869
00:58:04,312 --> 00:58:07,189
Well, I'm not running away anymore.
I'm settled now.

870
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:09,191
Above a saloon, it's true...

871
00:58:09,192 --> 00:58:10,817
but walk up a flight...

872
00:58:10,818 --> 00:58:14,613
I'll be expecting you.

873
00:58:14,614 --> 00:58:17,574
All the same,
someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

874
00:58:17,575 --> 00:58:20,827
You'll be there.

875
00:58:20,828 --> 00:58:23,288
No, Rick.

876
00:58:23,289 --> 00:58:26,583
No. You see, Victor Laszlo
is my husband.

877
00:58:26,584 --> 00:58:31,584
And was,
even when I knew you in Paris.

878
00:58:34,717 --> 00:58:39,471
I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo that
Unfortunately I'm not able to help him.

879
00:58:39,472 --> 00:58:41,556
You see, my dear,
word has gone around.

880
00:58:41,557 --> 00:58:44,476
As leader of all illegal activities in
Casablanca...

881
00:58:44,477 --> 00:58:46,311
I am influential and respected.

882
00:58:46,312 --> 00:58:49,898
But it would not be worth my life
to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.

883
00:58:49,899 --> 00:58:52,192
You, however, are a different matter.

884
00:58:52,193 --> 00:58:56,989
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be
possible to get an exit visa for you.

885
00:58:56,990 --> 00:59:00,325
- You mean for me to go on alone?
- And only alone.

886
00:59:00,326 --> 00:59:03,745
I'll stay here and keep on trying.
I'm sure in a little while...

887
00:59:03,746 --> 00:59:05,747
Might as well be frank, monsieur.

888
00:59:05,748 --> 00:59:09,668
It would take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

889
00:59:09,669 --> 00:59:11,962
We are only interested in two visas.

890
00:59:11,963 --> 00:59:14,589
- Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
- No, Victor.

891
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:16,842
You two will want to discuss this.

892
00:59:16,843 --> 00:59:21,843
Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.

893
00:59:22,682 --> 00:59:24,641
No, Ilsa.
I won't let you stay here.

894
00:59:24,642 --> 00:59:28,270
You must get to America. Believe me,
somehow I will get out and join you.

895
00:59:28,271 --> 00:59:30,230
But if the situation were different...

896
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:32,941
if I had to stay
and there were only visa for one...

897
00:59:32,942 --> 00:59:35,444
would you take it?

898
00:59:35,445 --> 00:59:37,779
Yes, I would.

899
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:40,115
Yes, I see.

900
00:59:40,116 --> 00:59:44,202
When I had trouble getting out of Lille,
why didn't you leave me there?

901
00:59:44,203 --> 00:59:46,538
When I was sick
in Marseilles for two weeks...

902
00:59:46,539 --> 00:59:51,539
and you were in danger every minute,
why didn't you leave me then?

903
00:59:51,544 --> 00:59:56,506
I meant to,
but something always held me up.

904
00:59:56,507 --> 00:59:59,176
I love you very much, Ilsa.

905
00:59:59,177 --> 01:00:02,345
Your secret will be safe with me.

906
01:00:02,346 --> 01:00:04,639
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

907
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:09,640
Not more than 50 francs.

908
01:00:11,689 --> 01:00:13,648
We've decided, Signor Ferrari.

909
01:00:13,649 --> 01:00:17,194
For the present we will go on looking
for two visas. Thank you very much.

910
01:00:17,195 --> 01:00:19,321
Well, good luck, but be careful.

911
01:00:19,322 --> 01:00:22,491
- You know you're being shadowed?
- Of course. It becomes an instinct.

912
01:00:22,492 --> 01:00:25,744
I observe that you, in one respect,
are a very fortunate man.

913
01:00:25,745 --> 01:00:28,622
I am moved to make one more
suggestion. Why, I do not know.

914
01:00:28,623 --> 01:00:30,707
Because it cannot possibly profit me.

915
01:00:30,708 --> 01:00:34,002
Have you heard about Ugarte
and the letters of transit?

916
01:00:34,003 --> 01:00:35,212
Yes, something.

917
01:00:35,213 --> 01:00:38,590
Those letters were not found on Ugarte
when they arrested him.

918
01:00:38,591 --> 01:00:40,801
- You know where they are?
- Not for sure.

919
01:00:40,802 --> 01:00:44,513
But I'd guess that Ugarte
left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

920
01:00:44,514 --> 01:00:45,722
Rick?

921
01:00:45,723 --> 01:00:49,142
A difficult Customer, that Rick.
One never knows what he'll do or why.

922
01:00:49,143 --> 01:00:51,353
But it is worth a Chance.

923
01:00:51,354 --> 01:00:54,356
Thank you very much. Good day.

924
01:00:54,357 --> 01:00:56,733
Goodbye. Thank you for your coffee.

925
01:00:56,734 --> 01:00:58,735
I shall miss that
when we leave Casablanca.

926
01:00:58,736 --> 01:01:01,363
Gracious of you to share it with me.
Good day, mademoiselle.

927
01:01:01,364 --> 01:01:06,364
- Monsieur.
- Good day.

928
01:01:13,126 --> 01:01:15,252
- Here's to you, sir.
- Good luck.

929
01:01:15,253 --> 01:01:17,295
- I'd better be going.
- My check, please.

930
01:01:17,296 --> 01:01:21,216
I have to warn you, sir. This is
a dangerous place. Full of vultures.

931
01:01:21,217 --> 01:01:23,677
Vultures everywhere.
Thanks for everything.

932
01:01:23,678 --> 01:01:26,054
- Goodbye.
- It has been a pleasure to meet you.

933
01:01:26,055 --> 01:01:31,055
I'm sorry.

934
01:01:43,573 --> 01:01:48,573
Monsieur Rick, you are getting
to be your best Customer.

935
01:01:49,287 --> 01:01:51,830
Well, drinking.
I'm very pleased with you.

936
01:01:51,831 --> 01:01:53,915
You're beginning
to live like a Frenchman.

937
01:01:53,916 --> 01:01:56,418
That was some going-over
your men gave my place.

938
01:01:56,419 --> 01:01:58,587
We barely got cleaned up
in time to open.

939
01:01:58,588 --> 01:02:01,047
I told Strasser he wouldn't
find the letters here.

940
01:02:01,048 --> 01:02:03,341
But I told my men
to be especially destructive.

941
01:02:03,342 --> 01:02:06,595
You know how
that impresses Germans.

942
01:02:06,596 --> 01:02:09,264
Rick, have you got
those letters of transit?

943
01:02:09,265 --> 01:02:12,017
Louis, are you Pro-Vichy
or Free French?

944
01:02:12,018 --> 01:02:16,646
Serves me right for asking a direct
question. The subject is closed.

945
01:02:16,647 --> 01:02:21,647
- It looks like you're a little late.
- Huh?

946
01:02:26,574 --> 01:02:28,408
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

947
01:02:28,409 --> 01:02:32,579
Who knows? In her own way, she
may constitute an entire second front.

948
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:36,917
I think it's time for me to flatter
Strasser a little. I'll see you later.

949
01:02:36,918 --> 01:02:38,501
Sascha!

950
01:02:38,502 --> 01:02:39,753
French 75s.

951
01:02:39,754 --> 01:02:43,590
Put up a whole row of them, Sascha.
Starting here and ending here.

952
01:02:43,591 --> 01:02:45,133
We will begin with two.

953
01:02:53,976 --> 01:02:56,394
What did you say?
Would you kindly repeat it?

954
01:02:56,395 --> 01:03:01,395
- What I said is none of your business.
- I'll make it my business.

955
01:03:05,947 --> 01:03:10,947
I don't like disturbances in my place.
Either lay off politics or get out.

956
01:03:13,996 --> 01:03:15,789
You see, Captain?

957
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:18,375
The situation is not as under control
as you believe.

958
01:03:18,376 --> 01:03:20,460
We try to cooperate
with your government.

959
01:03:20,461 --> 01:03:22,879
But we cannot regulate
the feelings of our people.

960
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,340
Captain, are you certain
which side you're on?

961
01:03:25,341 --> 01:03:27,717
I have no conviction,
if that's what you mean.

962
01:03:27,718 --> 01:03:29,177
I blow With the Wind...

963
01:03:29,178 --> 01:03:31,805
and the prevailing wind
happens to be from Vichy.

964
01:03:31,806 --> 01:03:33,765
And if it should change?

965
01:03:33,766 --> 01:03:36,101
Surely the Reich doesn't admit
that possibility?

966
01:03:36,102 --> 01:03:38,395
We are concerned
about more than Casablanca.

967
01:03:38,396 --> 01:03:42,315
We know that every French province
in Africa is honeycombed with traitors.

968
01:03:42,316 --> 01:03:45,193
Waiting for their Chance.
Waiting perhaps for a leader.

969
01:03:45,194 --> 01:03:46,569
A leader? Like Laszlo?

970
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:49,030
Mm-hm. I have been thinking.

971
01:03:49,031 --> 01:03:52,534
It's too dangerous to let him go,
it may be too dangerous to let him stay.

972
01:03:52,535 --> 01:03:54,536
I see what you mean.

973
01:03:59,417 --> 01:04:01,501
Thank you, Carl.

974
01:04:01,502 --> 01:04:03,920
Thank you, Carl.

975
01:04:03,921 --> 01:04:06,214
Sit down. Have a brandy with us.

976
01:04:06,215 --> 01:04:08,800
To celebrate our leaving
for America tomorrow.

977
01:04:08,801 --> 01:04:10,093
Thank you very much.

978
01:04:10,094 --> 01:04:13,054
I thought you would ask me,
so I brought the good brandy...

979
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:15,056
and a third glass.

980
01:04:15,057 --> 01:04:17,225
At last the day's came!

981
01:04:17,226 --> 01:04:20,228
Frau Leuchtag and I
are speaking nothing but English now.

982
01:04:20,229 --> 01:04:23,231
So we should feel at home
when we get to America.

983
01:04:23,232 --> 01:04:25,233
A very nice idea.

984
01:04:25,234 --> 01:04:28,820
- To America.
- To America.

985
01:04:28,821 --> 01:04:33,241
To America.

986
01:04:35,828 --> 01:04:38,079
What watch?

987
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:42,751
- Ten watch.
- Such much?

988
01:04:42,752 --> 01:04:46,087
You will get along beautifully
in America.

989
01:04:46,088 --> 01:04:48,048
How is lady luck treating you?

990
01:04:48,049 --> 01:04:50,216
Oh, too bad.

991
01:04:50,217 --> 01:04:55,217
You'll find him over there.

992
01:04:58,309 --> 01:05:00,018
- Monsieur Rick?
- Yes?

993
01:05:00,019 --> 01:05:03,480
- Could I speak to you, please?
- How'd you get in? You're underage.

994
01:05:03,481 --> 01:05:05,940
- I came with Captain Renault.
- I should have known.

995
01:05:05,941 --> 01:05:07,442
My husband is with me too.

996
01:05:07,443 --> 01:05:10,320
He is? Captain Renault's getting
broad-minded. Sit down.

997
01:05:10,321 --> 01:05:11,529
Have a drink?

998
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:14,824
- No, of course not. You mind if I do?
- Oh, no.

999
01:05:14,825 --> 01:05:18,620
Monsieur Rick,
what kind of a man is Captain Renault?

1000
01:05:18,621 --> 01:05:20,330
Like any other man, only more so.

1001
01:05:20,331 --> 01:05:21,706
No, I mean...

1002
01:05:21,707 --> 01:05:23,750
is he trustworthy?
Is his word...?

1003
01:05:23,751 --> 01:05:26,211
Just a minute.
Who told you to ask me that?

1004
01:05:26,212 --> 01:05:27,837
He did. Captain Renault did.

1005
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:30,173
I thought so. Where's your husband?

1006
01:05:30,174 --> 01:05:34,636
At the roulette table,
trying to win enough for our exit visas.

1007
01:05:34,637 --> 01:05:36,638
Oh, of course he's losing.

1008
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:40,600
- How long have you been married?
- Eight weeks.

1009
01:05:40,601 --> 01:05:42,811
We come from Bulgaria.

1010
01:05:42,812 --> 01:05:45,230
Things are very bad there.

1011
01:05:45,231 --> 01:05:47,816
The devil has the people
by the throat.

1012
01:05:47,817 --> 01:05:50,527
So Jan and I, we...

1013
01:05:50,528 --> 01:05:53,446
We do not want our children
to grow up in such a country.

1014
01:05:53,447 --> 01:05:55,990
- So you decided to go to America.
- Yes.

1015
01:05:55,991 --> 01:05:58,535
But we haven't much money...

1016
01:05:58,536 --> 01:06:01,413
and traveling is so expensive
and difficult.

1017
01:06:01,414 --> 01:06:04,124
It was much more than we thought
to get here.

1018
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:08,420
And then Captain Renault sees us,
and he is so kind, he wants to help us.

1019
01:06:08,421 --> 01:06:09,921
Yes, I'll bet.

1020
01:06:09,922 --> 01:06:12,924
He tells me he can give us an exit visa.

1021
01:06:12,925 --> 01:06:14,634
But we have no money.

1022
01:06:14,635 --> 01:06:16,386
- Does he know that?
- Yes.

1023
01:06:16,387 --> 01:06:18,888
- And he's still willing to give you a visa?
- Yes.

1024
01:06:18,889 --> 01:06:22,976
- And you want to know...?
- Will he keep his word?

1025
01:06:22,977 --> 01:06:24,978
He always has.

1026
01:06:24,979 --> 01:06:27,522
Oh...

1027
01:06:27,523 --> 01:06:29,232
Monsieur...

1028
01:06:29,233 --> 01:06:31,443
you are a man.

1029
01:06:31,444 --> 01:06:34,320
If someone loved you very much...

1030
01:06:34,321 --> 01:06:39,117
so that your happiness was the only
thing that she wanted in the world...

1031
01:06:39,118 --> 01:06:42,495
and she did a bad thing
to make certain of it...

1032
01:06:42,496 --> 01:06:45,748
- ...could you forgive her?
- Nobody ever loved me that much.

1033
01:06:45,749 --> 01:06:49,752
And he never knew, and the girl kept
this bad thing locked in her heart...

1034
01:06:49,753 --> 01:06:51,713
that would be all right,
wouldn't it?

1035
01:06:51,714 --> 01:06:54,382
- You want my advice?
- Yes, please.

1036
01:06:54,383 --> 01:06:55,717
Go back to Bulgaria.

1037
01:06:55,718 --> 01:07:00,718
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us
to leave Europe, to get to America...

1038
01:07:01,182 --> 01:07:05,435
Oh, but if Jan should find out.
He is such a boy.

1039
01:07:05,436 --> 01:07:09,063
In many ways
I am so much older than he is.

1040
01:07:09,064 --> 01:07:11,649
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca
has problems.

1041
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:16,650
- Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
- Thank you, monsieur.

1042
01:07:23,496 --> 01:07:24,954
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1043
01:07:24,955 --> 01:07:26,414
You see? Here we are again.

1044
01:07:26,415 --> 01:07:28,666
I take that
as a great compliment to Sam.

1045
01:07:28,667 --> 01:07:32,462
I suppose he means to you
Paris of happier days.

1046
01:07:32,463 --> 01:07:35,840
He does. Could we
have a table close to him?

1047
01:07:35,841 --> 01:07:38,510
And as far away
from Major Strasser as possible.

1048
01:07:38,511 --> 01:07:41,179
The geography may be
a little difficult to arrange.

1049
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:43,097
- Paul, table 30.
- Yes, sir.

1050
01:07:43,098 --> 01:07:45,099
Right this way, if you please.

1051
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:49,103
I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By."
I believe that's your favorite tune.

1052
01:07:49,104 --> 01:07:54,104
Thank you.

1053
01:07:59,782 --> 01:08:04,782
- Two cognacs, please.
- Cognac.

1054
01:08:25,474 --> 01:08:28,601
Do you wish to place another bet, sir?

1055
01:08:28,602 --> 01:08:30,478
No. No, I guess not.

1056
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:33,940
Have you tried 22 tonight?

1057
01:08:33,941 --> 01:08:37,026
I said 22.

1058
01:08:51,667 --> 01:08:56,667
Leave it there.

1059
01:09:08,017 --> 01:09:12,645
Cash it in and don't come back.

1060
01:09:12,646 --> 01:09:15,189
Are you sure this place is honest?

1061
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:20,190
Honest? As honest as the day is long.

1062
01:09:21,989 --> 01:09:23,656
How are we doing tonight?

1063
01:09:23,657 --> 01:09:28,657
A couple of thousand less
than I thought there would be.

1064
01:09:30,039 --> 01:09:32,498
Monsieur Rick...

1065
01:09:32,499 --> 01:09:37,045
I... Oh...

1066
01:09:37,046 --> 01:09:41,382
He's just a lucky guy.

1067
01:09:41,383 --> 01:09:44,427
Monsieur Rick,
may I get you a cup of coffee?

1068
01:09:44,428 --> 01:09:49,428
- No, thanks, Carl.
- Monsieur Rick...

1069
01:09:50,017 --> 01:09:51,684
Captain Renault, may I...?

1070
01:09:51,685 --> 01:09:54,187
Not here.
Come to my office in the morning.

1071
01:09:54,188 --> 01:09:56,022
We'll do everything businesslike.

1072
01:09:56,023 --> 01:09:58,733
- We'll be there at 6.
- I'll be there at 10.

1073
01:09:58,734 --> 01:10:00,735
I'm very happy for both of you.

1074
01:10:00,736 --> 01:10:03,029
Still, it's very strange that you won.

1075
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:05,448
Well, maybe not so strange.

1076
01:10:05,449 --> 01:10:08,701
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Thank you, Captain Renault.

1077
01:10:08,702 --> 01:10:12,580
No!

1078
01:10:16,001 --> 01:10:19,671
Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.

1079
01:10:19,672 --> 01:10:24,672
Go away, you crazy Russian.

1080
01:10:32,059 --> 01:10:35,103
As I suspected.
You're a rank sentimentalist.

1081
01:10:35,104 --> 01:10:36,312
Yeah? Why?

1082
01:10:36,313 --> 01:10:38,398
Why do you interfere
with my little romances?

1083
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:40,400
Put it down as a gesture to love.

1084
01:10:40,401 --> 01:10:42,110
Well, I'll forgive you this time.

1085
01:10:42,111 --> 01:10:45,113
But I'll be in tomorrow night
with a breathtaking blond.

1086
01:10:45,114 --> 01:10:47,990
And it'll make me very happy
if she loses.

1087
01:10:47,991 --> 01:10:51,411
Mm-hm.

1088
01:10:51,412 --> 01:10:53,830
Mr. Blaine,
I wonder if I could talk to you.

1089
01:10:53,831 --> 01:10:56,541
- Go ahead.
- Well, isn't there some other place?

1090
01:10:56,542 --> 01:11:01,003
It's rather Confidential,
what I have to say.

1091
01:11:01,004 --> 01:11:04,298
- In my office.
- Right.

1092
01:11:04,299 --> 01:11:07,135
You must know it's very important
I get out of Casablanca.

1093
01:11:07,136 --> 01:11:10,304
It's my privilege to be one of the leaders
of a great movement.

1094
01:11:10,305 --> 01:11:12,265
You know what I've been doing.

1095
01:11:12,266 --> 01:11:16,352
You know what it means to the work,
to the lives of thousands of people...

1096
01:11:16,353 --> 01:11:18,813
that I reach America
and continue my work.

1097
01:11:18,814 --> 01:11:20,398
I'm not interested in politics.

1098
01:11:20,399 --> 01:11:23,151
The problems of the world
are not in my department.

1099
01:11:23,152 --> 01:11:24,610
I'm a saloonkeeper.

1100
01:11:24,611 --> 01:11:28,322
My friends in the Underground tell me
that you have quite a record.

1101
01:11:28,323 --> 01:11:30,032
You ran guns to Ethiopia.

1102
01:11:30,033 --> 01:11:31,868
You fought against
the fascists in Spain.

1103
01:11:31,869 --> 01:11:33,077
What of it?

1104
01:11:33,078 --> 01:11:36,456
Isn't it strange you're always
fighting on the side of the underdog?

1105
01:11:36,457 --> 01:11:38,583
Yes, I found that
a very expensive hobby.

1106
01:11:38,584 --> 01:11:41,002
But then I never was
much of a businessman.

1107
01:11:41,003 --> 01:11:44,505
Are you enough of a businessman to
appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs?

1108
01:11:44,506 --> 01:11:47,759
- I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
- 200,000.

1109
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,511
My friend, you could make it
a million francs or three.

1110
01:11:50,512 --> 01:11:52,472
My answer would still be the same.

1111
01:11:52,473 --> 01:11:54,849
There must be some reason
why you won't let me.

1112
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:56,434
There is.

1113
01:11:56,435 --> 01:11:58,853
I Suggest that you ask your wife.

1114
01:11:58,854 --> 01:12:01,856
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, ask your wife.

1115
01:12:01,857 --> 01:12:04,567
- My wife?
- Yes.

1116
01:12:44,691 --> 01:12:49,691
Play "La Marseillaise." Play it!

1117
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:51,920
<i>Vive la France!</i>

1118
01:14:02,728 --> 01:14:06,898
See what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in
a café can inspire this demonstration...

1119
01:14:06,899 --> 01:14:09,525
what more will his presence
in Casablanca bring on?

1120
01:14:09,526 --> 01:14:11,819
I advise that this place
be shut up at once.

1121
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:14,947
- But everybody's having a good time.
- Yes, much too good a time.

1122
01:14:14,948 --> 01:14:16,324
The place is to be closed.

1123
01:14:16,325 --> 01:14:21,325
- But I have no excuse to close it.
- Find one.

1124
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:26,167
Everybody is to leave immediately.

1125
01:14:26,168 --> 01:14:28,628
This café is closed until further notice.

1126
01:14:28,629 --> 01:14:33,629
Clear the room at once.

1127
01:14:33,675 --> 01:14:35,217
How can you close me up?

1128
01:14:35,218 --> 01:14:38,846
I'm shocked, shocked to find that
gambling is going on in here.

1129
01:14:38,847 --> 01:14:40,932
- Your winnings, sir.
- Thank you.

1130
01:14:40,933 --> 01:14:45,933
Everybody out at once.

1131
01:14:46,647 --> 01:14:50,733
After this disturbance it is not safe
for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

1132
01:14:50,734 --> 01:14:53,694
This morning you implied it wasn't safe
to leave Casablanca.

1133
01:14:53,695 --> 01:14:56,864
That is also true, except for one
destination: Occupied France.

1134
01:14:56,865 --> 01:14:59,951
- Occupied France?
- Under safe conduct from me.

1135
01:14:59,952 --> 01:15:01,160
Of what value is that?

1136
01:15:01,161 --> 01:15:04,372
You may recall what German guarantees
have been worth in the past.

1137
01:15:04,373 --> 01:15:07,792
- There are two other alternatives for him.
- What are they?

1138
01:15:07,793 --> 01:15:09,919
The French authorities
may find a reason...

1139
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,254
to put him
in the concentration camp here.

1140
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:13,547
The other alternative?

1141
01:15:13,548 --> 01:15:16,008
My dear,
perhaps you have already observed...

1142
01:15:16,009 --> 01:15:18,469
that in Casablanca
human life is cheap.

1143
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:23,470
Good night, mademoiselle.

1144
01:15:30,524 --> 01:15:35,524
- What happened with Rick?
- We'll discuss it later.

1145
01:15:56,925 --> 01:15:59,468
Our faithful friend is still there.

1146
01:15:59,469 --> 01:16:02,263
Please don't go
to the Underground meeting tonight.

1147
01:16:02,264 --> 01:16:03,514
I must.

1148
01:16:03,515 --> 01:16:07,143
Besides, it isn't often that a man gets
to display heroics before his wife.

1149
01:16:07,144 --> 01:16:10,688
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's
warning tonight, I'm frightened.

1150
01:16:10,689 --> 01:16:12,690
Tell you the truth,
I'm frightened too.

1151
01:16:12,691 --> 01:16:15,317
Shall I remain here
in a hotel room, hiding?

1152
01:16:15,318 --> 01:16:17,361
Or shall I carry on the best I can?

1153
01:16:17,362 --> 01:16:20,906
Whatever I'd say,
you would carry on.

1154
01:16:20,907 --> 01:16:23,993
Victor, why don't you tell me
about Rick? What did you find out?

1155
01:16:23,994 --> 01:16:26,537
- Apparently he has the letters.
- Yes?

1156
01:16:26,538 --> 01:16:28,289
But no intention of selling them.

1157
01:16:28,290 --> 01:16:32,126
You'd think if sentiment
wouldn't persuade him, money would.

1158
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:33,919
Did he give any reason?

1159
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:37,381
- He suggested I ask you.
- Ask me?

1160
01:16:37,382 --> 01:16:40,509
Yes, he said, "Ask your wife."

1161
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:45,510
I don't know why he said that.

1162
01:16:54,816 --> 01:16:58,944
Well, our friend outside will think
we've retired by now.

1163
01:16:58,945 --> 01:17:02,823
I'll be going in a few minutes.

1164
01:17:02,824 --> 01:17:06,619
- Ilsa, I...
- Yes?

1165
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:09,455
When I was
in the concentration camp...

1166
01:17:09,456 --> 01:17:13,459
were you lonely in Paris?

1167
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:16,420
Yes, Victor, I was.

1168
01:17:16,421 --> 01:17:20,466
I know how it is to be lonely.

1169
01:17:20,467 --> 01:17:24,804
Is there anything you wish to tell me?

1170
01:17:24,805 --> 01:17:29,805
No, Victor, there isn't.

1171
01:17:31,436 --> 01:17:35,314
I love you very much, my dear.

1172
01:17:35,315 --> 01:17:37,316
Yes.

1173
01:17:37,317 --> 01:17:40,152
Yes, I know.

1174
01:17:40,153 --> 01:17:42,738
Victor, whatever I do,
will you believe that I...?

1175
01:17:42,739 --> 01:17:45,616
You don't even have to say it.

1176
01:17:45,617 --> 01:17:49,495
IllbeHeve.

1177
01:17:49,496 --> 01:17:52,832
Good night, dear.

1178
01:17:52,833 --> 01:17:57,833
Good night.

1179
01:18:01,216 --> 01:18:06,216
- Victor.
- Yes, dear?

1180
01:18:09,182 --> 01:18:12,143
Be careful.

1181
01:18:12,144 --> 01:18:17,144
Of course I'll be careful.

1182
01:18:57,063 --> 01:19:00,441
Well, you are in
pretty good shape, Herr Rick.

1183
01:19:00,442 --> 01:19:02,902
How long can I afford to stay closed?

1184
01:19:02,903 --> 01:19:04,403
Two weeks, maybe three.

1185
01:19:04,404 --> 01:19:06,822
Maybe I won't have to.
A bribe has worked before.

1186
01:19:06,823 --> 01:19:09,241
In the meantime,
everybody stays on salary.

1187
01:19:09,242 --> 01:19:10,784
Thank you, Herr Rick.

1188
01:19:10,785 --> 01:19:14,705
Sascha will be happy to hear it.
I owe him money.

1189
01:19:14,706 --> 01:19:17,708
- You finish locking up, will you, Carl?
- I will.

1190
01:19:17,709 --> 01:19:21,003
- Then I am going to the meeting...
- Don't tell me where you're going.

1191
01:19:21,004 --> 01:19:23,380
I won't.

1192
01:19:23,381 --> 01:19:25,591
Good night.

1193
01:19:25,592 --> 01:19:30,592
Good night, Mr. Rick.

1194
01:19:43,818 --> 01:19:47,404
- How did you get in?
- The stairs from the street.

1195
01:19:47,405 --> 01:19:50,908
I told you this morning you'd come
around, but this is ahead of schedule.

1196
01:19:50,909 --> 01:19:52,326
Well, won't you sit down?

1197
01:19:52,327 --> 01:19:56,413
- Richard, I had to see you.
- "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.

1198
01:19:56,414 --> 01:19:59,917
Your visit isn't connected
by any Chance with the letters of transit?

1199
01:19:59,918 --> 01:20:02,795
Seems as long as I have those letters
I'll never be lonely.

1200
01:20:02,796 --> 01:20:05,589
Ask any price you want,
but you must give me the letters.

1201
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:08,717
I went all through that
with your husband. It's no deal.

1202
01:20:08,718 --> 01:20:10,636
I know how you feel about me...

1203
01:20:10,637 --> 01:20:13,555
but put your feelings aside
for something more important.

1204
01:20:13,556 --> 01:20:16,183
I have to hear again
what a great man your husband is...

1205
01:20:16,184 --> 01:20:18,352
what an important cause
he's fighting for?

1206
01:20:18,353 --> 01:20:19,895
It was your cause too.

1207
01:20:19,896 --> 01:20:22,815
In your own way, you were fighting
for the same thing.

1208
01:20:22,816 --> 01:20:25,734
I'm not fighting for anything
anymore except myself.

1209
01:20:25,735 --> 01:20:30,735
I'm the only cause I'm interested in.

1210
01:20:32,826 --> 01:20:34,326
Richard.

1211
01:20:34,327 --> 01:20:38,038
We loved each other once. If those
days meant anything at all to you...

1212
01:20:38,039 --> 01:20:41,125
I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you.
It's poor salesmanship.

1213
01:20:41,126 --> 01:20:44,753
Listen to me. If you knew what really
happened, if you only knew the truth...

1214
01:20:44,754 --> 01:20:47,006
I wouldn't believe you
no matter what you said.

1215
01:20:47,007 --> 01:20:52,007
You'd say anything now
to get what you want.

1216
01:20:54,264 --> 01:20:57,182
You want to feel sorry for yourself,
don't you?

1217
01:20:57,183 --> 01:21:00,561
With so much at stake
all you can think of is your feelings.

1218
01:21:00,562 --> 01:21:01,937
One woman has hurt you...

1219
01:21:01,938 --> 01:21:04,857
and you take your revenge
on the rest of the world.

1220
01:21:04,858 --> 01:21:09,858
You're a coward and a weakling.

1221
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:14,742
No. Oh, Richard. I'm sorry.

1222
01:21:14,743 --> 01:21:17,870
I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.

1223
01:21:17,871 --> 01:21:20,748
If you don't help us,
Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

1224
01:21:20,749 --> 01:21:21,957
What of it?

1225
01:21:21,958 --> 01:21:26,958
I'm going to die in Casablanca.
It's a good spot for it.

1226
01:21:31,468 --> 01:21:35,679
Now, if you'll...

1227
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:37,139
All right.

1228
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:39,350
I tried to reason with you.

1229
01:21:39,351 --> 01:21:41,977
I tried everything.
Now, I want those letters.

1230
01:21:41,978 --> 01:21:46,690
- Get them for me.
- I don't have to. I got them right here.

1231
01:21:46,691 --> 01:21:50,402
Put them on the table.

1232
01:21:50,403 --> 01:21:52,571
No.

1233
01:21:52,572 --> 01:21:55,949
For the last time,
put them on the table.

1234
01:21:55,950 --> 01:22:00,950
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you, you won't stop at anything.

1235
01:22:01,373 --> 01:22:05,793
All right,
I'll make it easier for you.

1236
01:22:05,794 --> 01:22:10,794
Go ahead and shoot.
You'll be doing me a favor.

1237
01:22:14,427 --> 01:22:16,470
Richard...

1238
01:22:16,471 --> 01:22:19,223
I tried to stay away.

1239
01:22:19,224 --> 01:22:23,018
I thought I would never see you again.

1240
01:22:23,019 --> 01:22:28,019
That you were out of my life.

1241
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:49,336
The day you left Paris...

1242
01:22:49,337 --> 01:22:53,006
if you knew what I went through.

1243
01:22:53,007 --> 01:22:56,677
If you knew how much I loved you.

1244
01:22:56,678 --> 01:23:01,678
How much I still love you.

1245
01:23:13,403 --> 01:23:16,488
And then?

1246
01:23:16,489 --> 01:23:20,993
It wasn't long after we were married
that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

1247
01:23:20,994 --> 01:23:24,705
They needed him in Prague, but there
the Gestapo were waiting for him.

1248
01:23:24,706 --> 01:23:26,582
Just a two-line item in the paper:

1249
01:23:26,583 --> 01:23:30,377
"Victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp."

1250
01:23:30,378 --> 01:23:33,005
I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word.

1251
01:23:33,006 --> 01:23:34,423
Then it came.

1252
01:23:34,424 --> 01:23:37,885
He was dead.
Shot trying to escape.

1253
01:23:37,886 --> 01:23:41,805
I was lonely.
I had nothing, not even hope.

1254
01:23:41,806 --> 01:23:43,557
Then I met you.

1255
01:23:43,558 --> 01:23:47,102
Why weren't you honest with me?
Why'd you keep your marriage a secret?

1256
01:23:47,103 --> 01:23:50,397
It wasn't my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.

1257
01:23:50,398 --> 01:23:53,358
Not even our closest friends
knew about our marriage.

1258
01:23:53,359 --> 01:23:56,528
That was his way of protecting me.
I knew so much about his work.

1259
01:23:56,529 --> 01:23:59,990
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife
it would be dangerous for me...

1260
01:23:59,991 --> 01:24:02,159
and for those working with us.

1261
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:05,537
And when did you first find out
he was alive?

1262
01:24:05,538 --> 01:24:08,248
Just before you and I
were to leave Paris together.

1263
01:24:08,249 --> 01:24:10,834
A friend came and told me
that Victor was alive.

1264
01:24:10,835 --> 01:24:14,296
They were hiding him in a freight car
on the outskirts of Paris.

1265
01:24:14,297 --> 01:24:17,883
He was sick. He needed me.

1266
01:24:17,884 --> 01:24:20,677
I wanted to tell you,
but I didn't dare.

1267
01:24:20,678 --> 01:24:25,678
I knew you wouldn't have left Paris,
and the Gestapo would have caught you.

1268
01:24:25,683 --> 01:24:27,768
Well...

1269
01:24:27,769 --> 01:24:32,397
well, you know the rest.

1270
01:24:32,398 --> 01:24:35,609
Well, it's still a story
without an ending.

1271
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:37,945
What about now?

1272
01:24:37,946 --> 01:24:39,780
N OW?

1273
01:24:39,781 --> 01:24:41,990
I don't know.

1274
01:24:41,991 --> 01:24:46,245
I know that I'll never have the strength
to leave you again.

1275
01:24:46,246 --> 01:24:47,663
And Laszlo?

1276
01:24:47,664 --> 01:24:51,083
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.

1277
01:24:51,084 --> 01:24:54,586
Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.

1278
01:24:54,587 --> 01:24:57,548
All except one.

1279
01:24:57,549 --> 01:25:01,134
He won't have you.

1280
01:25:01,135 --> 01:25:04,638
I can't fight it anymore.

1281
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:09,639
I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.

1282
01:25:09,978 --> 01:25:13,188
Oh, I don't know
what's right any longer.

1283
01:25:13,189 --> 01:25:16,275
You have to think for both of us.

1284
01:25:16,276 --> 01:25:21,276
For all of us.

1285
01:25:21,281 --> 01:25:26,281
All right. I Will.

1286
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:31,582
Here's looking at you, kid.

1287
01:25:31,583 --> 01:25:36,583
I wish I didn't love you so much.

1288
01:25:47,056 --> 01:25:49,308
- I think we lost them.
- Yes.

1289
01:25:49,309 --> 01:25:51,435
I'm afraid they caught
some of the others.

1290
01:25:51,436 --> 01:25:56,436
Come inside.

1291
01:25:56,774 --> 01:26:01,774
Come, Mr. Laszlo,
I will help you immediately.

1292
01:26:01,863 --> 01:26:06,863
Thank you.

1293
01:26:21,090 --> 01:26:23,425
Carl, what happened?

1294
01:26:23,426 --> 01:26:25,594
The police break up our meeting,
Herr Rick.

1295
01:26:25,595 --> 01:26:27,262
We escaped at the last moment.

1296
01:26:27,263 --> 01:26:29,723
- Come up here a minute.
- Yes, I come.

1297
01:26:29,724 --> 01:26:33,226
Turn out the light in the rear entrance.
It might attract the police.

1298
01:26:33,227 --> 01:26:36,647
- But Sascha always puts out that light.
- Tonight he forgot.

1299
01:26:36,648 --> 01:26:41,648
Yes, I come. I will do it.

1300
01:26:46,574 --> 01:26:51,574
- I want you to take Miss Lund home.
- Yes, sir.

1301
01:27:01,047 --> 01:27:04,341
It's nothing, just a little cut.
We had to get through a window.

1302
01:27:04,342 --> 01:27:06,301
This might come in handy.

1303
01:27:06,302 --> 01:27:07,636
Thank you.

1304
01:27:07,637 --> 01:27:12,265
- Had a close one, eh?
- Yes, rather.

1305
01:27:12,266 --> 01:27:15,185
Don't you sometimes wonder
if it's worth all this?

1306
01:27:15,186 --> 01:27:18,105
I mean, what you're fighting for.

1307
01:27:18,106 --> 01:27:20,399
We might as well question
why we breathe.

1308
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,109
If we stop breathing, we'll die.

1309
01:27:22,110 --> 01:27:24,736
If we stop fighting our enemies,
the world will die.

1310
01:27:24,737 --> 01:27:27,155
What of it?
Then it'll be out of its misery.

1311
01:27:27,156 --> 01:27:29,491
You know how you sound,
Monsieur Blaine?

1312
01:27:29,492 --> 01:27:31,868
Like a man
Who's trying to convince himself...

1313
01:27:31,869 --> 01:27:34,287
of something
he doesn't believe in his heart.

1314
01:27:34,288 --> 01:27:37,958
Each of us has a destiny.
For good, or for evil.

1315
01:27:37,959 --> 01:27:40,836
- I get the point.
- I wonder if you do.

1316
01:27:40,837 --> 01:27:44,131
I wonder if you know that you're trying
to escape from yourself...

1317
01:27:44,132 --> 01:27:45,882
and that you'll never succeed.

1318
01:27:45,883 --> 01:27:49,928
You seem to know
all about my destiny.

1319
01:27:49,929 --> 01:27:52,889
I know a good deal more
about you than you suspect.

1320
01:27:52,890 --> 01:27:55,308
I know that you're in love
with a woman.

1321
01:27:55,309 --> 01:27:57,227
It's perhaps a strange circumstance...

1322
01:27:57,228 --> 01:28:00,313
that we both should be in love
with the same woman.

1323
01:28:00,314 --> 01:28:02,649
The first evening
I came into this café...

1324
01:28:02,650 --> 01:28:05,819
I knew there was something
between you and Ilsa.

1325
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:07,904
Since no one is to blame...

1326
01:28:07,905 --> 01:28:10,073
I demand no explanation.

1327
01:28:10,074 --> 01:28:13,535
I ask only one thing.
You won't give me the letters of transit.

1328
01:28:13,536 --> 01:28:15,287
All right.

1329
01:28:15,288 --> 01:28:17,497
But I want my wife to be safe.

1330
01:28:17,498 --> 01:28:19,082
I ask you as a favor...

1331
01:28:19,083 --> 01:28:22,169
to use the letters
to take her away from Casablanca.

1332
01:28:22,170 --> 01:28:23,503
You love her that much?

1333
01:28:23,504 --> 01:28:26,882
Apparently you think of me only
as the leader of a cause.

1334
01:28:26,883 --> 01:28:30,260
Well, I am also a human being.

1335
01:28:30,261 --> 01:28:32,012
Yes, I love herthat much.

1336
01:28:39,562 --> 01:28:41,021
- Monsieur Laszlo?
- Yes?

1337
01:28:41,022 --> 01:28:43,690
You'll come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1338
01:28:43,691 --> 01:28:44,900
On what Charge?

1339
01:28:44,901 --> 01:28:47,277
Captain Renault will discuss that
with you later.

1340
01:28:47,278 --> 01:28:52,278
It seems that destiny
has taken a hand.

1341
01:29:01,793 --> 01:29:06,129
You haven't any proof, and you know it.
This isn't Germany or occupied France.

1342
01:29:06,130 --> 01:29:08,590
All you can do is fine him
and give him 30 days.

1343
01:29:08,591 --> 01:29:10,383
You might as well let him go now.

1344
01:29:10,384 --> 01:29:13,553
I'd advise you not to be too interested
in what happens to Laszlo.

1345
01:29:13,554 --> 01:29:15,222
If you were to help him escape...

1346
01:29:15,223 --> 01:29:17,808
What makes you think
I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?

1347
01:29:17,809 --> 01:29:20,435
Because, one,
you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.

1348
01:29:20,436 --> 01:29:23,730
Two, you've got the letters of transit.
Don't bother to deny it.

1349
01:29:23,731 --> 01:29:26,983
And you might do it simply
because you don't like Strasser's looks.

1350
01:29:26,984 --> 01:29:29,027
As a matter of fact,
I don't either.

1351
01:29:29,028 --> 01:29:30,570
They're all excellent reasons.

1352
01:29:30,571 --> 01:29:32,697
Don't count too much
on my friendship.

1353
01:29:32,698 --> 01:29:36,493
In this matter I'm powerless.
Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.

1354
01:29:36,494 --> 01:29:41,248
You're not very subtle,
but you are effective. I get the point.

1355
01:29:41,249 --> 01:29:42,916
Yes, I have the letters.

1356
01:29:42,917 --> 01:29:45,126
But I intend using them myself.

1357
01:29:45,127 --> 01:29:48,839
I'm leaving Casablanca
on tonight's plane. The last plane.

1358
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:52,092
And I'm taking a friend with me.
One you'll appreciate.

1359
01:29:52,093 --> 01:29:54,219
- What friend?
- Ilsa Lund.

1360
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:57,973
That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape.

1361
01:29:57,974 --> 01:30:00,267
The last man I want to see in America.

1362
01:30:00,268 --> 01:30:03,603
You didn't come here to tell me this.
You have the letters of transit.

1363
01:30:03,604 --> 01:30:06,940
You can fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please.

1364
01:30:06,941 --> 01:30:09,776
Why are you still interested
in what happens to Laszlo?

1365
01:30:09,777 --> 01:30:14,239
I'm not. But I am interested
in what happens to Ilsa and me.

1366
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:16,366
We have a legal right to go,
that's true...

1367
01:30:16,367 --> 01:30:18,618
but people have been held
in Casablanca...

1368
01:30:18,619 --> 01:30:20,412
in spite of their legal rights.

1369
01:30:20,413 --> 01:30:22,414
What makes you think
we want to hold you?

1370
01:30:22,415 --> 01:30:23,623
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife.

1371
01:30:23,624 --> 01:30:26,459
She probably knows things
that Strasser would like to know.

1372
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:28,169
Louis, I'll make a deal with you.

1373
01:30:28,170 --> 01:30:31,882
Instead of this petty Charge against him,
you could get something big...

1374
01:30:31,883 --> 01:30:35,302
something that would Chuck him
in a concentration camp for years...

1375
01:30:35,303 --> 01:30:38,096
- Be quite a feather in your cap, right?
- Certainly.

1376
01:30:38,097 --> 01:30:40,432
Germany...
Vichy would be very grateful.

1377
01:30:40,433 --> 01:30:41,641
Then release him.

1378
01:30:41,642 --> 01:30:44,477
You be at my place a half-hour
before the plane leaves.

1379
01:30:44,478 --> 01:30:47,188
I'll have Laszlo come there
to pick up the letters...

1380
01:30:47,189 --> 01:30:50,066
and that'll give you grounds
to make the arrest.

1381
01:30:50,067 --> 01:30:52,527
You get him, and we get away.

1382
01:30:52,528 --> 01:30:55,655
To the Germans,
that last will be just a minor annoyance.

1383
01:30:55,656 --> 01:30:58,658
There's still something about this
I don't quite understand.

1384
01:30:58,659 --> 01:31:01,494
Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes...

1385
01:31:01,495 --> 01:31:03,997
but you were never interested
in any woman.

1386
01:31:03,998 --> 01:31:07,250
- She isn't just any woman.
- I see.

1387
01:31:07,251 --> 01:31:09,836
How do I know you'll keep
your end of the bargain?

1388
01:31:09,837 --> 01:31:12,839
I'll make the arrangements now
with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

1389
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:14,215
I'm gonna miss you.

1390
01:31:14,216 --> 01:31:17,594
You're the only one in Casablanca
who has less scruples than I.

1391
01:31:17,595 --> 01:31:19,512
Oh, thanks.

1392
01:31:19,513 --> 01:31:20,805
Go ahead, Ricky.

1393
01:31:20,806 --> 01:31:23,642
Call off your watchdogs
when you let him go.

1394
01:31:23,643 --> 01:31:25,685
I don't want them around
this afternoon.

1395
01:31:25,686 --> 01:31:30,686
I'm taking no chances, Louis,
not even with you.

1396
01:31:35,196 --> 01:31:38,031
Should we draw up papers,
or is a handshake good enough?

1397
01:31:38,032 --> 01:31:41,576
Certainly not good enough.
But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.

1398
01:31:41,577 --> 01:31:45,121
To get out of Casablanca and
go to America... You're a lucky man.

1399
01:31:45,122 --> 01:31:50,122
My agreement with Sam is that he gets
25 percent of the profits. That still goes.

1400
01:31:50,711 --> 01:31:53,672
I happen to know he gets 10 percent.
But he's worth 25.

1401
01:31:53,673 --> 01:31:56,841
Abdul, Carl and Sascha,
they stay with the place or I don't sell.

1402
01:31:56,842 --> 01:31:59,427
Of course.
Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.

1403
01:31:59,428 --> 01:32:00,929
Well, so long.

1404
01:32:00,930 --> 01:32:04,140
Don't forget you owe Rick's
100 cartons of American cigarettes.

1405
01:32:04,141 --> 01:32:09,141
I shall remember to pay it to myself.

1406
01:32:41,429 --> 01:32:42,637
You're late.

1407
01:32:42,638 --> 01:32:45,974
I was informed when Laszlo
left the hotel so I knew I'd be on time.

1408
01:32:45,975 --> 01:32:49,185
- I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
- He won't be followed here.

1409
01:32:49,186 --> 01:32:51,479
This place will never be
the same without you.

1410
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:55,191
I know what you mean. But I've Spoken
to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.

1411
01:32:55,192 --> 01:32:58,111
- Is everything ready?
- I have the letters right here.

1412
01:32:58,112 --> 01:33:00,447
When we searched the place,
where were they?

1413
01:33:00,448 --> 01:33:02,365
Sam's piano.

1414
01:33:02,366 --> 01:33:04,576
Serves me right for not being musical.

1415
01:33:04,577 --> 01:33:06,119
Here they are.

1416
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:11,120
You better wait in my office.

1417
01:33:16,047 --> 01:33:17,547
Here.

1418
01:33:17,548 --> 01:33:20,258
Victor thinks I'm leaving with him.
Haven't you told him?

1419
01:33:20,259 --> 01:33:21,468
Not yet.

1420
01:33:21,469 --> 01:33:23,219
But you were able to
arrange everything?

1421
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:24,471
Everything is quite all right.

1422
01:33:24,472 --> 01:33:27,640
We'll tell him at the airport.
The less time to think, the easier.

1423
01:33:27,641 --> 01:33:31,519
Please trust me.

1424
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:36,520
Yes, I will.

1425
01:33:37,985 --> 01:33:42,985
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Save it. We've still lots of things to do.

1426
01:33:43,866 --> 01:33:47,368
- I brought the money.
- Keep it, you'll need it in America.

1427
01:33:47,369 --> 01:33:49,454
- But we made a deal.
- Never mind that.

1428
01:33:49,455 --> 01:33:52,916
- You won't have any trouble in Lisbon?
- No. It's all arranged.

1429
01:33:52,917 --> 01:33:55,418
Good. I've got the letters here,
made out in blank.

1430
01:33:55,419 --> 01:33:58,004
All you have to do is fill
in the signatures.

1431
01:33:58,005 --> 01:33:59,964
Victor Laszlo.

1432
01:33:59,965 --> 01:34:04,965
Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.

1433
01:34:05,304 --> 01:34:07,138
The Charge of
accessory to the murder...

1434
01:34:07,139 --> 01:34:09,891
of the couriers
from whom the letters were stolen.

1435
01:34:09,892 --> 01:34:13,353
You're surprised about my friend Ricky?
The explanation is simple.

1436
01:34:13,354 --> 01:34:17,107
Love, it seems,
has triumphed over virtue. Thank...

1437
01:34:17,108 --> 01:34:21,694
Not so fast, Louis. Nobody is going
to be arrested. Not for a while yet.

1438
01:34:21,695 --> 01:34:23,863
- Have you lost your mind?
- I have. Sit down.

1439
01:34:23,864 --> 01:34:26,199
- Put that gun down.
- I don't want to shoot you...

1440
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:28,743
but I will if you take one more step.

1441
01:34:28,744 --> 01:34:33,744
Under the circumstances,
I will sit down.

1442
01:34:34,208 --> 01:34:37,877
- Keep your hands on the table.
- I wonder if you realize what this means.

1443
01:34:37,878 --> 01:34:40,213
I do. We've got time
to discuss that later.

1444
01:34:40,214 --> 01:34:41,965
Call off your watchdogs, you said.

1445
01:34:41,966 --> 01:34:44,759
Just the same, call the airport
and let me hear you tell them.

1446
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:47,345
And remember,
this gun is pointed right at your heart.

1447
01:34:47,346 --> 01:34:52,346
That is my least vulnerable spot.

1448
01:34:56,981 --> 01:35:00,358
- Hello? Is that the airport?
- Huh?

1449
01:35:00,359 --> 01:35:02,235
This is Captain Renault speaking.

1450
01:35:02,236 --> 01:35:04,946
There'll be two letters of transit
for the Lisbon plane.

1451
01:35:04,947 --> 01:35:07,157
There's to be no trouble about them.

1452
01:35:07,158 --> 01:35:08,616
Good.

1453
01:35:08,617 --> 01:35:12,370
Hello? Hello?

1454
01:35:14,915 --> 01:35:16,124
My car, quickly!

1455
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:19,252
This is Major Strasser.

1456
01:35:19,253 --> 01:35:21,880
Have a squad of police meet me
at the airport at once.

1457
01:35:21,881 --> 01:35:26,881
At once, do you hear?

1458
01:35:30,306 --> 01:35:32,515
Hello, radio tower?

1459
01:35:32,516 --> 01:35:35,894
Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes,
east runway.

1460
01:35:35,895 --> 01:35:38,521
Visibility, 1 ½ miles.

1461
01:35:38,522 --> 01:35:42,609
Light ground fog.
Depth of fog approximately 500.

1462
01:35:42,610 --> 01:35:47,610
Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.

1463
01:35:57,875 --> 01:36:00,793
Have your man go with Laszlo
and take care of his luggage.

1464
01:36:00,794 --> 01:36:02,754
Certainly, Rick, anything you say.

1465
01:36:02,755 --> 01:36:05,048
Find Laszlo's luggage.
Put it on the plane.

1466
01:36:05,049 --> 01:36:06,257
Yes, sir.

1467
01:36:06,258 --> 01:36:09,177
This way, please.

1468
01:36:09,178 --> 01:36:12,472
If you don't mind, fill in the names.
That'll make it more official.

1469
01:36:12,473 --> 01:36:14,682
You think of everything, don't you?

1470
01:36:14,683 --> 01:36:17,310
And the names are
Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

1471
01:36:17,311 --> 01:36:21,064
- But why my name, Richard?
- Because you're getting on that plane.

1472
01:36:21,065 --> 01:36:22,815
I don't understand.
What about you?

1473
01:36:22,816 --> 01:36:25,109
I'm staying with him
till the plane gets away.

1474
01:36:25,110 --> 01:36:27,278
No. What has happened?
Last night you said...

1475
01:36:27,279 --> 01:36:29,239
Last night
we said a great many things.

1476
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:31,324
You said
I was to do the thinking for us.

1477
01:36:31,325 --> 01:36:33,826
I've done a lot of it since then.
It adds up to one thing:

1478
01:36:33,827 --> 01:36:36,287
You're getting on that plane
with Victor where you belong.

1479
01:36:36,288 --> 01:36:38,998
- Richard, no...
- Now, you've got to listen to me.

1480
01:36:38,999 --> 01:36:42,043
Any idea what you'd have
to look forward to if you stayed here?

1481
01:36:42,044 --> 01:36:45,505
Chances are we'd both wind up
in a concentration camp. True, Louis?

1482
01:36:45,506 --> 01:36:47,966
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

1483
01:36:47,967 --> 01:36:51,594
- You're saying this only to make me go.
- I'm saying it because it's true.

1484
01:36:51,595 --> 01:36:54,013
Inside of us we both know
you belong with Victor.

1485
01:36:54,014 --> 01:36:56,516
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

1486
01:36:56,517 --> 01:36:59,602
If that plane leaves
and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

1487
01:36:59,603 --> 01:37:03,982
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

1488
01:37:03,983 --> 01:37:06,234
But what about us?

1489
01:37:06,235 --> 01:37:07,819
We'll always have Paris.

1490
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:11,197
We didn't have... We'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.

1491
01:37:11,198 --> 01:37:13,783
We got it back last night.

1492
01:37:13,784 --> 01:37:18,037
- When I said I would never leave you.
- And you never will.

1493
01:37:18,038 --> 01:37:19,747
But I've got a job to do too.

1494
01:37:19,748 --> 01:37:21,374
Where I'm going, you can't follow.

1495
01:37:21,375 --> 01:37:24,085
What I've got to do
you can't be any part of.

1496
01:37:24,086 --> 01:37:25,795
Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble.

1497
01:37:25,796 --> 01:37:29,424
But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of three little people...

1498
01:37:29,425 --> 01:37:32,302
don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

1499
01:37:32,303 --> 01:37:36,014
Someday you'll understand that.

1500
01:37:36,015 --> 01:37:39,392
Now, now.

1501
01:37:39,393 --> 01:37:44,393
Here's looking at you, kid.

1502
01:37:56,869 --> 01:37:59,579
- Everything is in order.
- All except one thing.

1503
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:01,956
There's something you should know.

1504
01:38:01,957 --> 01:38:03,916
I don't ask you to explain anything.

1505
01:38:03,917 --> 01:38:07,211
I'm going to anyway.
It may make a difference to you later on.

1506
01:38:07,212 --> 01:38:09,255
- You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
- Yes.

1507
01:38:09,256 --> 01:38:12,258
You didn't know she was at my place
last night when you were.

1508
01:38:12,259 --> 01:38:16,137
She came there for the letters of transit.
Isn't that true, Ilsa?

1509
01:38:16,138 --> 01:38:17,555
Yes.

1510
01:38:17,556 --> 01:38:19,766
She tried everything to get them.
Nothing worked.

1511
01:38:19,767 --> 01:38:23,436
She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.

1512
01:38:23,437 --> 01:38:26,147
But that was all over long ago.

1513
01:38:26,148 --> 01:38:29,942
For your sake, she pretended it wasn't,
and I let her pretend.

1514
01:38:29,943 --> 01:38:31,736
I understand.

1515
01:38:31,737 --> 01:38:34,614
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

1516
01:38:34,615 --> 01:38:37,283
I appreciate it.

1517
01:38:37,284 --> 01:38:39,285
Welcome back to the fight.

1518
01:38:39,286 --> 01:38:44,286
This time I know our side will win.

1519
01:38:55,511 --> 01:38:59,555
Are you ready, llsa?

1520
01:38:59,556 --> 01:39:04,060
Yes, I'm ready.

1521
01:39:04,061 --> 01:39:06,312
Goodbye, Rick.

1522
01:39:06,313 --> 01:39:09,524
God bless you.

1523
01:39:09,525 --> 01:39:14,525
You better hurry.
You'll miss that plane.

1524
01:39:30,295 --> 01:39:32,380
I was right.
You are a sentimentalist.

1525
01:39:32,381 --> 01:39:35,383
Stay where you are.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1526
01:39:35,384 --> 01:39:36,884
What you just did for Laszlo.

1527
01:39:36,885 --> 01:39:39,470
That fairy tale you invented
to send Ilsa away with him.

1528
01:39:39,471 --> 01:39:42,014
I know a little about women, my friend.
She went.

1529
01:39:42,015 --> 01:39:44,183
But she knew you were lying.

1530
01:39:44,184 --> 01:39:46,310
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

1531
01:39:46,311 --> 01:39:49,730
I suppose you know this isn't
going to be pleasant for either of us.

1532
01:39:49,731 --> 01:39:51,065
Especially for you.

1533
01:39:51,066 --> 01:39:56,066
- I'll have to arrest you, of course.
- As soon as the plane goes, Louis.

1534
01:40:01,326 --> 01:40:03,369
What was the meaning
of that phone call?

1535
01:40:03,370 --> 01:40:08,207
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

1536
01:40:08,208 --> 01:40:10,501
Why do you stand here?
Why don't you stop him?

1537
01:40:10,502 --> 01:40:14,839
Ask Monsieur Rick.

1538
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:17,884
- Get away from that phone.
- I advise you not to interfere.

1539
01:40:17,885 --> 01:40:22,885
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault,
and I'm willing to shoot you.

1540
01:40:23,098 --> 01:40:24,849
- Hello!
- Put that phone down.

1541
01:40:24,850 --> 01:40:29,850
- Get me the radio tower.
- Put it down!

1542
01:40:41,742 --> 01:40:46,742
Major Strasser has been shot.

1543
01:40:48,081 --> 01:40:53,081
Round up the usual suspects.

1544
01:41:14,441 --> 01:41:16,734
Well, Rick,
you're not only a sentimentalist...

1545
01:41:16,735 --> 01:41:18,528
but you've become a patriot.

1546
01:41:18,529 --> 01:41:20,863
Maybe, but it seemed
like a good time to start.

1547
01:41:20,864 --> 01:41:25,864
I think perhaps you're right.

1548
01:41:47,641 --> 01:41:51,519
It might be a good idea for you to
disappear from Casablanca for a while.

1549
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:54,146
There's a Free French garrison
over at Brazzaville.

1550
01:41:54,147 --> 01:41:58,150
- I could be induced to arrange a passage.
- My letter of transit?

1551
01:41:58,151 --> 01:41:59,610
I could use a trip.

1552
01:41:59,611 --> 01:42:03,114
But it doesn't change our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 francs.

1553
01:42:03,115 --> 01:42:06,158
That 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

1554
01:42:06,159 --> 01:42:08,244
- "Our" expenses?
- Mm-hm.

1555
01:42:08,245 --> 01:42:13,245
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
