00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,668
With the coming
of the Second World War...

2
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:17,000
...many eyes in imprisoned Europe
turned hopefully, or desperately...

3
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:20,007
...toward the freedom of the Americas.

4
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,875
Lisbon became
the great embarkation point.

5
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:26,247
But not everybody could get
to Lisbon directly.

6
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:30,350
And so a torturous, roundabout
refugee trail sprang up.

7
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,019
Paris to Marseilles...

8
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:41,695
...across the Mediterranean to Oran.

9
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:53,503
Then, by train or auto or foot,
across the rim of Africa...

10
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:56,205
...to Casablanca in French Morocco.

11
00:01:56,484 --> 00:02:00,978
Here, the fortunate ones,
through money or influence or luck...

12
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:04,655
...might obtain exit visas
and scurry to Lisbon.

13
00:02:05,026 --> 00:02:07,256
And from Lisbon to the New World.

14
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,658
But the others wait in Casablanca.

15
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:14,824
And wait and wait...

16
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,799
...and wait.

17
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:28,039
To all officers:

18
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:33,084
Two German couriers carrying official
documents murdered on train from Oran.

19
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:36,279
Murderer and possible accomplices
headed for Casablanca.

20
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,290
Round up all suspicious characters
and search them for stolen document.

21
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:42,059
Important.

22
00:03:13,828 --> 00:03:15,227
May we see your papers?

23
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:17,224
I don't think I have them on me.

24
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:20,730
- In that case, you'll have to come along.
- Wait. It's possible that I...

25
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,994
Yes. Here they are.

26
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,075
These papers expired three weeks ago.
You'll have to come along.

27
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,903
Halt!

28
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,169
Halt!

29
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,802
- What on earth is going on there?
- I don't know, my dear.

30
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,475
Pardon, monsieur. Pardon, madame.
Have you not heard?

31
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:06,442
We hear very little,
and we understand even less.

32
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:10,276
Two German couriers were found murdered
in the desert. The unoccupied desert.

33
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,975
This is the customary roundup
of refugees, liberals...

34
00:04:13,154 --> 00:04:16,783
...and, of course, a beautiful young girl
for Renault, the prefect of police.

35
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:25,421
Along with these unhappy refugees, the scum
of Europe has gravitated to Casablanca.

36
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,999
Some of them have been waiting
years for a visa.

37
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:31,467
I beg of you, monsieur, watch yourself.
Be on guard.

38
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,663
This place is full of vultures.

39
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:36,571
Vultures everywhere. Everywhere!

40
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:39,212
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Not at all.

41
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:43,247
What an amusing little fellow.

42
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,747
Waiter.

43
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,152
- Oh, how silly of me.
- What, dear?

44
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:50,688
I've left my wallet in the hotel.

45
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,508
Perhaps tomorrow
we'll be on the plane.

46
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:37,928
It is good to see you again,
Major Strasser.

47
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:39,298
Thank you, thank you.

48
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,770
May I present Captain Renault,
police prefect of Casablanca. Major Strasser.

49
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,969
Unoccupied France welcomes you
to Casablanca.

50
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:48,144
Thank you, captain.
It's good to be here.

51
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,977
Major Strasser, my aide,
Lieutenant Casselle.

52
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,619
Captain Tonnelli.
The Italian service at your command.

53
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:54,981
That is kind of you.

54
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:04,295
You may find the climate
of Casablanca a trifle warm.

55
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:08,128
We Germans must get used to all climates,
from Russia to the Sahara.

56
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:11,404
- Perhaps you weren't referring to weather.
- What else?

57
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,836
The murder of the couriers.
What has been done?

58
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:17,808
My men are rounding up
twice the usual number of suspects.

59
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:21,004
- But we know already who the murderer is.
- Good. Is he in custody?

60
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:24,150
No hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's.
Everybody comes to Rick's.

61
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:27,810
I've already heard about this café.
And also about Mr. Rick himself.

62
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:25,570
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

63
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,770
I'll never get out of here.

64
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,015
I'll die in Casablanca.

65
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,447
But can't you make it just a little more?

66
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,608
Please?

67
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:37,222
Sorry, but diamonds are a drug
on the market. Everybody sells diamonds.

68
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,654
There are diamonds everywhere. 2400.

69
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,986
All right.

70
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:44,130
The trucks are waiting.
The men are waiting. Everything--

71
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:50,060
It's the fishing smack Santiago.

72
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:54,640
It leaves at 1 tomorrow night,
here from the end of La Medina. Third boat.

73
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:58,107
- Thank you. Thank you.
- And bring 15,000 francs in cash.

74
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,576
Remember, in cash.

75
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,447
Cheerio.

76
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:12,154
- Open up, Abdul.
- Yes, professor.

77
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:22,897
- Waiter?
- Yes, madame?

78
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,765
Will you ask Rick
if he'll have a drink with us?

79
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:29,439
Madame, he never drinks with customers.
Never. I have never seen it.

80
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:32,472
What makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?

81
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,513
Perhaps if you told him I ran the
second-largest banking house in Amsterdam.

82
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:39,345
Second largest?
That wouldn't impress Rick.

83
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,081
The leading banker in Amsterdam
is now the pastry chef in our kitchen.

84
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,781
We have something
to look forward to.

85
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:49,289
And his father is the bellboy.

86
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,492
Excuse me.

87
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,125
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a private room.

88
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:28,924
Of all the nerve. Who do you think--?
I know there is gambling in there.

89
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:32,231
- You dare not keep me out.
- Yes? What's the trouble?

90
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:35,431
I have been in every gambling room
between Honolulu and Berlin.

91
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:39,669
And if you think I'm going to be kept out
of a saloon like this, you're much mistaken.

92
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,814
Excuse me, please.
Hello, Rick.

93
00:09:44,485 --> 00:09:46,282
Your cash is good at the bar.

94
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,451
What? Do you know who I am?

95
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,623
I do. You're lucky the bar is open to you.

96
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:53,793
This is outrageous!
I shall report it to The Angriff.

97
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:01,124
You know, watching you just now, one would
think you've been doing this all your life.

98
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:04,134
- What makes you think I haven't?
- Nothing.

99
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:08,297
- But when you first came, I thought--
- You thought what?

100
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,972
What right do I have to think?

101
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,277
May I?

102
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,978
Too bad about those two
German couriers, wasn't it?

103
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:23,817
They got a lucky break.
Yesterday they were just clerks...

104
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,255
...today they are the honored dead.

105
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,318
You are a very cynical person, Rick,
if you'll forgive me for saying so.

106
00:10:30,531 --> 00:10:31,623
I forgive you.

107
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,493
- Will you have a drink with me?
- No.

108
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,669
I forgot, you never drink with--
I'll have another, please.

109
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,333
You despise me, don't you?

110
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,698
If I gave you any thought,
I probably would.

111
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,206
But why?

112
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,307
Do you object to the kind of business I do?

113
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:51,474
But think of all those poor refugees who
must rot in this place if I didn't help them.

114
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:56,247
That's not so bad. Through ways of my own,
I provide them with exit visas.

115
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:58,686
For a price, Ugarte. For a price.

116
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:03,253
But think of all the poor devils
who can't meet Renault's price.

117
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:06,864
I get it for them for half.
Is that so parasitic?

118
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:10,629
I don't mind a parasite.
I object to a cut-rate one.

119
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,205
Well, after tonight I will be through
with the whole business.

120
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:17,070
And I'm leaving, finally,
this Casablanca.

121
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:20,304
Who did you bribe for your visa?
Renault or yourself?

122
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:23,980
Myself.
I found myself much more reasonable.

123
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:25,508
Look, Rick.

124
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:27,853
Know what this is?

125
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:31,155
Something that even you have never seen.

126
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,486
Letters of transit signed
by General de Gaulle.

127
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:37,993
Cannot be rescinded.
Not even questioned.

128
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:39,154
One moment.

129
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:42,631
Tonight I'll be selling those
for more money than I ever dreamed of.

130
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:45,636
And then, addio, Casablanca.

131
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,135
I have many a friend in Casablanca,
but somehow, just because you despise me...

132
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,777
...you are the only one I trust.

133
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,842
Will you keep these for me, please?

134
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,811
- For how long?
- Perhaps an hour. Perhaps a little longer.

135
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:59,748
- I don't want them here overnight.
- Don't be afraid of that.

136
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,512
Please keep them for me.

137
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,883
Thank you.
I knew I could trust you.

138
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,392
Waiter. I'll be expecting some people.

139
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,461
If anybody asks for me,
I'll be right here.

140
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:11,686
Rick...

141
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,991
...I hope you're more impressed
with me now.

142
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:18,600
If you'll forgive me, I'll share my good luck
with your roulette wheel.

143
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:19,864
Just a moment.

144
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:26,072
I heard a rumor those two German couriers
were carrying letters of transit.

145
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:32,348
I've heard that rumor too. Poor devils.

146
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:36,511
You're right, Ugarte.
I am a little more impressed with you.

147
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,371
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Ferrari.

148
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,166
How's business at the Blue Parrot?

149
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,866
- Fine, but I'd like to buy your café.
- It's not for sale.

150
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:07,274
- You haven't heard my offer.
- It's not for sale at any price.

151
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:11,008
- What do you want for Sam?
- I don't buy or sell human beings.

152
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:13,345
Too bad.
That's Casablanca's leading commodity.

153
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:17,614
In refugees alone we could make a fortune,
if you'd work with me in the black market.

154
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,191
Suppose you run your business
and let me run mine.

155
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:23,462
Suppose we ask Sam.
Maybe he'd like to make a change.

156
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,722
Suppose we do.

157
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:29,858
When will you realize that in this world today
isolationism is no longer a practical policy?

158
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:32,799
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him
at the Blue Parrot.

159
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:34,065
Oh, I like it fine here.

160
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:38,142
- He'll double what I pay you.
- I ain't got time to spend what I make here.

161
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,606
Sorry.

162
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,781
The boss's private stock...

163
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:48,386
- ...because, Yvonne, I love you.
- Oh, shut up.

164
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:52,581
All right, all right. For you, I shut up,
because, Yvonne, I love you.

165
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:59,926
Some Germans gave this check.
Is it all right?

166
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:06,434
Where were you last night?

167
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,870
That's so long ago,
I don't remember.

168
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:12,542
- Will I see you tonight?
- I never make plans that far ahead.

169
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:15,075
Give me another.

170
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,012
- Sascha, she's had enough.
- Don't listen to him. Fill it up.

171
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:20,380
Yvonne, I love you,
but he pays me.

172
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,078
- Rick, I'm tired of having you--
- Sascha, call a cab.

173
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,656
- We're gonna get your coat.
- Take your hands off me.

174
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:28,386
You're going home.
You've had a little too much to drink.

175
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:32,832
Hey, taxi.

176
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:35,694
Who do you think you are,
pushing me around?

177
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:37,632
I was a fool
to fall for a man like you.

178
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,829
Go with her, Sascha.
Be sure she gets home.

179
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:40,995
And come right back.

180
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,675
Yes, boss.

181
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:56,115
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Louis.

182
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:58,587
How extravagant you are,
throwing away women.

183
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,487
Someday they may be scarce.

184
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:02,928
I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne.

185
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,721
Maybe get her on the rebound.

186
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:07,025
When it comes to women,
you're a true democrat.

187
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,302
If he gets a word in,
it'll be a major Italian victory.

188
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,312
The plane to Lisbon.

189
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,788
You would like to be on it?

190
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,654
Why? What's in Lisbon?

191
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,895
The clipper to America.

192
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:39,793
I've often speculated on why
you don't return to America.

193
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,936
Did you abscond with the church funds?
Did you run off with a senator's wife?

194
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,999
I like to think you killed a man.
It's the romantic in me.

195
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,868
It's a combination of all three.

196
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,509
And what in heaven's name
brought you to Casablanca?

197
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,146
My health.
I came to Casablanca for the waters.

198
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:57,610
The waters? What waters?
We're in the desert.

199
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,015
I was misinformed.

200
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:03,953
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick.

201
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:06,957
A gentleman inside
has won 20,000 francs...

202
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,522
...and the cashier
would like some money.

203
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,126
I'll get it from the safe.

204
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:13,857
I'm so upset, Rick. You know I--

205
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:16,661
Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that
happen all the time.

206
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,633
I'm awfully sorry.

207
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,873
Rick, there will be some excitement
here tonight. An arrest in your café.

208
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,777
- Again?
- This is no ordinary arrest.

209
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:31,348
A murderer, no less.

210
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:35,580
If you're thinking of warning him,
don't put yourself out. He cannot escape.

211
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:39,589
- I stick my neck out for nobody.
- A wise foreign policy.

212
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,855
Could have made the arrest earlier,
at the Blue Parrot.

213
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:48,159
Out of my regard for you,
we're staging it here.

214
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:49,825
It will amuse your customers.

215
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:52,496
Our entertainment's enough.

216
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,132
We're to have an important guest
here tonight.

217
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:57,833
Major Strasser of the Third Reich, no less.

218
00:17:58,011 --> 00:18:00,172
We want him to be here
when we make the arrest.

219
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:02,907
A demonstration of the efficiency
of my administration.

220
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,017
I see.
And what's Strasser doing here?

221
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:09,120
He certainly didn't come here to witness
a demonstration of your efficiency.

222
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:10,414
- Perhaps not.
- Here.

223
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:12,717
- It shall not happen again.
- That's all right.

224
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,759
Louis, you got something on your mind.
Why don't you spill it.

225
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,452
How observant you are.

226
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,493
As a matter of fact,
I wanted to give you a word of advice.

227
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:21,656
Yeah?

228
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:24,232
- Have a brandy?
- Thank you.

229
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:29,365
There are many exit visas sold in this café,
but we know that you've never sold one.

230
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:32,037
That is the reason
we permit you to remain open.

231
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:34,510
I thought it was because
I let you win at roulette.

232
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:35,909
That is another reason.

233
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,880
There is a man arrived in Casablanca
on his way to America.

234
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,952
He will offer a fortune to anyone
who'll furnish an exit visa.

235
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:44,646
- What's his name?
- Victor Laszlo.

236
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:46,424
Victor Laszlo?

237
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:49,187
Rick, that is the first time
I've seen you so impressed.

238
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:51,353
He's succeeded in impressing
half the world.

239
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:54,989
It's my duty to see that
he doesn't impress the other half.

240
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:58,137
Laszlo must never reach America.
He stays in Casablanca.

241
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,406
It'll be interesting
to see how he manages.

242
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:02,734
- Manages what?
- His escape.

243
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,807
- But I just told you--
- Stop it.

244
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:08,641
He escaped from a concentration camp.
The Nazis have chased him all over Europe.

245
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,146
This is the end of the chase.

246
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,944
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.

247
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:14,483
Is that a serious offer?

248
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:17,015
I just paid out 20,
and I'd like to get it back.

249
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:20,019
Make it 10.
I'm only a poor corrupt official.

250
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,021
- Okay.
- Done.

251
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:26,221
No matter how clever he is, he still
needs an exit visa. Or I should say two.

252
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,725
- Why two?
- He is traveling with a lady.

253
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:31,631
- He'll take one.
- I think not. I've seen the lady.

254
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:34,566
And if he did not leave her
in Marseilles or Oran...

255
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:37,201
...he certainly won't leave her
in Casablanca.

256
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,537
Maybe he's not quite
as romantic as you are.

257
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:42,977
It doesn't matter.
There is no exit visa for him.

258
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:47,211
What ever gave you the impression
that I might help Laszlo escape?

259
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:50,750
Because, my dear Ricky,
I suspect that under that cynical shell...

260
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:52,653
...you are at heart a sentimentalist.

261
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:56,228
Laugh if you will,
but I happen to be familiar with your record.

262
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:58,556
Let me point out just two items:

263
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:02,891
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.

264
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:06,971
In 1936, you fought in Spain
on the Loyalist side.

265
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,471
And got well paid for it on both occasions.

266
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,974
The winning side would
have paid you much better.

267
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:13,401
Maybe.

268
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:16,642
It seems you're determined
to keep Laszlo here.

269
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,613
I have my orders.

270
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,250
I see. Gestapo spank.

271
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:24,252
My dear Ricky, you overestimate
the influence of the Gestapo.

272
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,790
I don't interfere with them,
and they don't interfere with me.

273
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:30,087
In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.

274
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:32,390
- I am--
- Major Strasser is here, sir.

275
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,795
- You were saying?
- Excuse me.

276
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:47,808
Carl, see that Major Strasser
gets a good table, close to the ladies.

277
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:52,610
I have already given him the best, knowing
he is German and would take it anyway.

278
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,951
Take him quietly.
Two guards at every door.

279
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:04,887
- Everything is ready, sir.
- Go ahead.

280
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,935
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, captain.

281
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,131
- Won't you join us?
- Thank you.

282
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:19,940
- It's a pleasure to have you here, major.
- Champagne and a tin of caviar.

283
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:23,513
May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26,
a good French wine.

284
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:25,674
Very well, sir.

285
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:29,183
- A very interesting club.
- Especially so tonight, major.

286
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:32,984
In a few minutes you'll see the arrest
of the man who murdered your couriers.

287
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:34,683
I expected no less, captain.

288
00:21:34,928 --> 00:21:36,486
Monsieur Ugarte.

289
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:41,898
- Will you please come with us?
- Certainly.

290
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:45,134
May I first please cash my chips?

291
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:54,907
Very lucky, huh? Two thousand, please.

292
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:18,737
Rick! Rick, help me!

293
00:22:18,972 --> 00:22:23,033
- Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
- But, Rick, hide me. Do something!

294
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:32,014
Excellent, captain.

295
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,846
When they come for me,
I hope you'll be more of a help.

296
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:37,114
I stick my neck out for nobody.

297
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:41,156
I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks,
but it's all over now.

298
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:44,888
Just sit down and have a good time.
Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.

299
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:56,163
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser
of the Third Reich.

300
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:58,242
- How do you do, Mr. Rick?
- How do you do?

301
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:00,538
You already know Herr Heinze
of the Third Reich.

302
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:03,215
Please join us, Mr. Rick.

303
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,377
We are very honored tonight.

304
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:12,718
Major Strasser is one of the reasons
the Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.

305
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,861
You repeat Third Reich
as though you expected there to be others.

306
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,656
Well, personally, major,
I will take what comes.

307
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,858
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

308
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,628
- Unofficially, of course.
- Make it official if you like.

309
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:27,398
- What is your nationality?
- I'm a drunkard.

310
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:31,033
And that makes Rick a citizen
of the world.

311
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:33,869
I was born in New York City,
if that'll help you any.

312
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:37,577
I understand you came here from Paris
at the time of the occupation.

313
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,513
There seems to be no secret about that.

314
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:43,883
Are you one of those people who cannot
imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?

315
00:23:44,057 --> 00:23:46,287
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

316
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:48,357
Can you imagine us in London?

317
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:50,985
When you get there, ask me.

318
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:52,624
Diplomatist.

319
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,959
How about New York?

320
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:59,002
Well, there are sections of New York, major,
that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.

321
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:02,406
- Who do you think will win the war?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

322
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:07,239
Rick is completely neutral about everything.
And that takes in the field of women too.

323
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:11,713
You were not always so carefully neutral.
We have a complete dossier on you.

324
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:17,719
"Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37.
Cannot return to his country."

325
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:21,483
The reason is a little vague.
We also know what you did in Paris.

326
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:25,392
And also we know why you left Paris.
Don't worry, we're not going to broadcast it.

327
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:26,793
Are my eyes really brown?

328
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,197
You will forgive my curiosity,
Mr. Blaine. The point is...

329
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,600
...an enemy of the Reich
has come to Casablanca...

330
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:35,764
...and we are checking up on anybody
who can be of any help to us.

331
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:40,002
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo
stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

332
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:43,941
In this case you have no sympathy
for the fox?

333
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,608
Not particularly. I understand
the point of view of the hound too.

334
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:50,788
Laszlo published the foulest lies
in the Prague newspapers...

335
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:52,549
...until the day we marched in.

336
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:57,059
And even after that, he continued
to print scandal sheets in his cellar.

337
00:24:57,263 --> 00:24:59,925
Of course, one must admit
he has great courage.

338
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,325
I admit he's clever.
Three times he slipped through our fingers.

339
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:07,439
In Paris he continued his activities.
We intend not to let it happen again.

340
00:25:07,607 --> 00:25:11,065
Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business
is politics, mine is running a saloon.

341
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:13,108
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

342
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,271
You see, major?
You have nothing to worry about Rick.

343
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,015
Perhaps.

344
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:27,124
- I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
- Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.

345
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:56,016
Two Cointreaux, please.

346
00:25:58,124 --> 00:26:00,524
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.

347
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:03,819
Victor, I feel somehow
we shouldn't stay here.

348
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:06,931
If we would walk out so soon
it would only call attention to us.

349
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,297
Perhaps Ugarte is in
some other part of the café.

350
00:26:11,104 --> 00:26:14,801
Excuse me, but you look like a couple
who are on their way to America.

351
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:19,508
You'll find a market there for this ring.
I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.

352
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:22,203
- Thank you, but I hardly think...
- Perhaps for the lady.

353
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:23,882
The ring is quite unique.

354
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:29,681
- Yes, I'm very interested.
- Good.

355
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,280
What is your name?

356
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:33,755
Berger, Norwegian.
At your service, sir.

357
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:37,522
I'll meet you in a few minutes
at the bar.

358
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,290
We don't want the ring,
but thanks for showing it to us.

359
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:43,526
- Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
- I'm sorry, it is.

360
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:48,466
- Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
- Yes?

361
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:50,665
I am Captain Renault,
prefect of police.

362
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:52,003
Yes, what is it you want?

363
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:55,305
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca
and wish you a pleasant stay.

364
00:26:55,515 --> 00:26:58,211
It isn't often we have
so distinguished a visitor.

365
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,851
Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me, captain.

366
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:04,545
The present French administration
hasn't always been so cordial.

367
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:06,622
May I present Miss Ilsa Lund.

368
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:11,295
I was told you were the most
beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca.

369
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,261
That was a gross understatement.

370
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:14,757
You're very kind.

371
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,458
- Won't you join us?
- If you will permit me.

372
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:22,398
Oh, no, Emile, please. A bottle of your
best champagne. And put it on my bill.

373
00:27:22,575 --> 00:27:26,944
It's a game we play. They put it on the bill,
I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.

374
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,878
Captain,
the boy who's playing the piano...

375
00:27:31,551 --> 00:27:33,018
Somewhere I've seen him.

376
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:34,743
- Sam?
- Yes.

377
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:36,650
He came from Paris with Rick.

378
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,289
Rick? Who is he?

379
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:41,858
- Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's. Rick is...
- Is what?

380
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:45,326
Mademoiselle, he's the kind of man that,
well, if I were a woman...

381
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:48,227
...and I were not around,
I should be in love with Rick.

382
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:51,961
But what a fool I am talking
to a beautiful woman about another man.

383
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:54,430
Excuse me.

384
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:56,438
Major.

385
00:27:57,977 --> 00:28:01,105
Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo,
may I present Major Strasser.

386
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,304
How do you do?

387
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,472
This is a pleasure
I have looked forward to.

388
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:07,209
I'm sure you'll excuse me
if I'm not gracious.

389
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:09,513
You see, Major Strasser,
I am a Czechoslovakian.

390
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:13,816
You were a Czechoslovakian.
Now you are a subject of the German Reich.

391
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:18,452
I have never accepted that privilege.
And I'm now on French soil.

392
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:22,430
I should like to discuss some matters arising
from your presence on French soil.

393
00:28:22,602 --> 00:28:24,229
This is hardly the time or place.

394
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:28,840
Then we shall state another time and place.
Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.

395
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,269
With mademoiselle.

396
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:34,971
Captain, I am under your authority.

397
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:37,206
Is it your order
that we come to your office?

398
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:41,284
Let us say it is my request.
That is a much more pleasant word.

399
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:42,784
Very well.

400
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:50,019
A very clever tactical retreat, major.

401
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:54,297
- This time they really mean to stop me.
- Victor, I'm afraid for you.

402
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,362
We've been in difficult places before,
haven't we?

403
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,604
I must find out what Berger knows.

404
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:36,002
- Be careful.
- I will. Don't worry.

405
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:56,521
Monsieur Berger, the ring.
Could I see it again?

406
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,687
Champagne cocktail, please.

407
00:29:59,532 --> 00:30:02,262
I recognize you from the news photographs,
Monsieur Laszlo.

408
00:30:02,435 --> 00:30:05,404
In a concentration camp,
one is apt to lose a little weight.

409
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:08,563
We read five times that you were killed
in five different places.

410
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:11,607
As you see,
it was true every single time.

411
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:13,335
Thank heaven I found you, Berger.

412
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:17,039
I'm looking for a man by the name of Ugarte.
He's supposed to help me.

413
00:30:17,717 --> 00:30:19,981
Ugarte cannot even help himself.

414
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:24,384
He's under arrest for murder.
He was arrested here tonight.

415
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,116
I see.

416
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:30,652
But we who are still free will do
all we can. We are organized.

417
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:33,058
Underground, like everywhere else.

418
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:36,063
Tomorrow night there is a meeting
at the Caverne du Bois.

419
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:38,062
If you will come--

420
00:30:51,584 --> 00:30:53,916
Will you ask the piano player
to come over here?

421
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:56,213
Very well, mademoiselle.

422
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:01,690
- How's the jewelry business, Berger?
- Not so good. Check, please.

423
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:06,025
Too bad you weren't here earlier. We had
quite a bit of excitement, didn't we, Berger?

424
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:07,765
Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.

425
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:11,369
- My bill.
- No. Two champagne cocktails. Please.

426
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,339
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Miss Ilsa.

427
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:21,035
I never expected to see you again.

428
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,344
It's been a long time.

429
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:26,541
Yes, ma'am.
A lot of water under the bridge.

430
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:31,388
- Some of the old songs, Sam.
- Yes, ma'am.

431
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,489
Where is Rick?

432
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:45,569
I don't know.
I ain't seen him all night.

433
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:49,972
- When will he be back?
- Not tonight no more. He ain't coming--

434
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:51,871
He went home.

435
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,245
- Does he always leave so early?
- He never--

436
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:58,815
Well, he's got a girl up to the Blue Parrot.

437
00:31:59,018 --> 00:32:01,111
Goes up there all the time.

438
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:05,350
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.

439
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:09,523
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa.
You're bad luck to him.

440
00:32:12,465 --> 00:32:15,457
Play it once, Sam.
For old times' sake.

441
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:18,000
I don't know what you mean,
Miss Ilsa.

442
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:20,128
Play it, Sam.

443
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,131
Play "As Time Goes By."

444
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:26,670
I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa.
I'm a little rusty on it.

445
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,571
I'll hum it for you.

446
00:32:41,227 --> 00:32:42,626
Sing it, Sam.

447
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:31,538
Sam, I thought I told you never to play--

448
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:45,156
Well, you were asking about Rick,
and here he is. May I present--

449
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,655
- Hello, Ilsa.
- Hello, Rick.

450
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,352
Oh, you've already met Rick, mademoiselle?
Then perhaps you also--

451
00:33:51,564 --> 00:33:52,895
This is Mr. Laszlo.

452
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:54,463
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

453
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,926
One hears a great deal about Rick
in Casablanca.

454
00:33:57,303 --> 00:33:59,100
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.

455
00:33:59,305 --> 00:34:01,432
- Won't you join us for a drink?
- Rick never--

456
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:03,472
- Thanks, I will.
- Well...

457
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:06,577
...a precedent is being broken. Emile.

458
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:10,871
- Interesting café. I congratulate you.
- I congratulate you.

459
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,574
- What for?
- Your work.

460
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:14,446
Thank you. I try.

461
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:17,254
We all try. You succeed.

462
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:22,324
She was asking about you earlier, Rick,
in a way that made me extremely jealous.

463
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:24,719
I wasn't sure you were the same.

464
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:28,331
- Let's see, the last time we met--
- Was La Belle Aurore.

465
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:31,836
How nice. You remembered.

466
00:34:32,004 --> 00:34:34,802
But, of course, that was the day
the Germans marched into Paris.

467
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:37,168
Not an easy day to forget.

468
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:41,674
I remember every detail.
The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.

469
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:45,676
Yes. I put that dress away.

470
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:48,216
When the Germans march out
I'll wear it again.

471
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:52,516
Ricky, you're becoming quite human.
I suppose we have to thank you for that.

472
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:56,156
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one
to say it, but it's late.

473
00:34:56,362 --> 00:35:00,423
So it is. We have a curfew in Casablanca.
It would never do for the chief of police...

474
00:35:00,633 --> 00:35:02,624
...to be found drinking after hours.

475
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:05,734
- I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
- Not at all.

476
00:35:06,038 --> 00:35:07,630
- Your check, sir.
- It's my party.

477
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,401
Another precedent gone.
This has been a very interesting evening.

478
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:15,546
I'll call you a cab.
Gasoline rationing, time of night.

479
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:17,443
- We'll come again.
- Anytime.

480
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,709
- Say good night to Sam for me.
- I will.

481
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:24,713
There's still nobody in the world
who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.

482
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,725
He hasn't played it in a long time.

483
00:35:29,228 --> 00:35:31,196
- Good night.
- Good night.

484
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:32,990
Night.

485
00:35:40,873 --> 00:35:43,364
A very puzzling fellow, this Rick.
What sort is he?

486
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:46,772
I really can't say,
though I saw him quite often in Paris.

487
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:49,539
- Tomorrow at 10, at the prefect office.
- We'll be there.

488
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:51,410
- Good night.
- Good night.

489
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:31,779
Boss?

490
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:37,361
- Boss?
- Yeah?

491
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:40,923
- Boss, ain't you going to bed?
- Not right now.

492
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:44,068
Ain't you planning on going to bed
in the near future?

493
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:46,395
- You ever going to bed?
- No.

494
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:49,037
Well, I ain't sleepy, either.

495
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:50,401
Good, then have a drink.

496
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:52,543
- Not me, boss.
- Then don't have a drink.

497
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,269
Boss, let's get out of here.

498
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,005
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.

499
00:36:57,182 --> 00:36:59,776
Please, let's go.
Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.

500
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:01,953
She's coming back.
I know she's coming back.

501
00:37:02,121 --> 00:37:03,816
We'll take the car and drive all night.

502
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:06,855
We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing,
stay away until she's gone.

503
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:11,394
- Shut up and go home, will you?
- No, sir, I'm staying right here.

504
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:19,427
They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.

505
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,333
That's the way it goes.
One in, one out.

506
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:26,569
- Sam.
- Yes, boss?

507
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:31,209
If it's December 1941 in Casablanca,
what time is it in New York?

508
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,842
What?

509
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:34,708
My watch stopped.

510
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:37,716
I bet they're asleep in New York.

511
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:40,653
I bet they're asleep all over America.

512
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:51,630
Of all the gin joints in all the towns
in all the world...

513
00:37:51,804 --> 00:37:53,829
...she walks into mine.

514
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:04,010
- What's that you're playing?
- A little something of my own.

515
00:38:04,183 --> 00:38:06,981
- Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
- No, I don't.

516
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:09,279
You played it for her.
You can play it for me.

517
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:12,651
- I don't think I can remember--
- If she can stand it, I can.

518
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:13,882
Play it.

519
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:16,358
Yes, boss.

520
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:48,847
Who are you really?
And what were you before?

521
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:51,179
What did you do,
and what did you think?

522
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:53,691
We said no questions.

523
00:39:58,363 --> 00:40:00,388
Here's looking at you, kid.

524
00:40:34,366 --> 00:40:36,095
A franc for your thoughts.

525
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:38,701
In America they'd bring only a penny.

526
00:40:39,171 --> 00:40:41,105
I guess that's about all they're worth.

527
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,937
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.

528
00:40:46,745 --> 00:40:48,372
Well, I was wondering...

529
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:54,584
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should
find you waiting for me to come along.

530
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:57,882
Why there is no other man in my life?

531
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:02,455
That's easy.
There was.

532
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:05,987
He's dead.

533
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:08,798
I'm sorry for asking.

534
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:11,868
I forgot we said no questions.

535
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:19,373
Only one answer can take care
of all our questions.

536
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:08,116
Nothing can stop them now. Wednesday,
Thursday at the latest, they'll be in Paris.

537
00:42:08,293 --> 00:42:11,228
Richard, they'll find out your record.
You won't be safe here.

538
00:42:11,396 --> 00:42:14,854
I'm on their blacklist already.
Their roll of honor.

539
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:03,006
Henri wants us to finish this bottle
and then three more.

540
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:06,981
Says he'll water his garden with champagne
before he'll let the Germans drink it.

541
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:10,450
This sort of takes the sting out
of being occupied, doesn't it?

542
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:11,883
You said it.

543
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,024
Here's looking at you, kid.

544
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:43,311
My German's a little rusty.

545
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:46,181
It's the Gestapo.

546
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,924
They say they expect to be
in Paris tomorrow.

547
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,588
They're telling us how to act
when they come marching in.

548
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,862
With the whole world crumbling,
we pick this time to fall in love.

549
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:03,700
It's pretty bad timing.

550
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:07,638
- Where were you, say, 10 years ago?
- 10 years ago?

551
00:44:09,281 --> 00:44:10,714
Let's see.

552
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:14,851
Yes, I was having a brace put on my teeth.
Where were you?

553
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,011
Looking for a job.

554
00:44:23,662 --> 00:44:25,220
Was that cannon fire?

555
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:27,630
Or is it my heart pounding?

556
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:31,893
It's the new German 77th, and judging
by the sound, only about 35 miles away.

557
00:44:34,206 --> 00:44:36,367
And getting closer every minute.

558
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:38,668
Here, here, drink up.

559
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:41,240
We'll never finish the other three.

560
00:44:41,446 --> 00:44:44,882
Them Germans will be here pretty soon,
and they'll come looking for you.

561
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:47,177
And don't forget,
there's a price on your head.

562
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:50,378
I left a note in my apartment.
They'll know where to find me.

563
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,186
It's strange.

564
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:56,792
- I know so very little about you.
- I know very little about you.

565
00:44:56,962 --> 00:44:59,328
Just the fact that
you had your teeth straightened.

566
00:45:00,632 --> 00:45:03,499
Be serious, darling. You are in danger.
You must leave Paris.

567
00:45:03,702 --> 00:45:04,828
No, we must leave.

568
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,237
Yes, of course. We.

569
00:45:07,439 --> 00:45:11,170
The train for Marseilles leaves at 5:00.
I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.

570
00:45:12,577 --> 00:45:14,374
Not at my hotel. I...

571
00:45:15,447 --> 00:45:18,143
I have things to do in the city
before I leave.

572
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,377
I'll meet you at the station.

573
00:45:20,652 --> 00:45:22,779
All right, at a quarter to 5.

574
00:45:23,021 --> 00:45:24,852
Why don't we get married
in Marseilles?

575
00:45:29,527 --> 00:45:31,222
That's too far ahead to plan.

576
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:33,193
Yes. I guess it is too far ahead.

577
00:45:34,499 --> 00:45:38,060
Let's see... What about the engineer?
Why can't he marry us on the train?

578
00:45:38,536 --> 00:45:42,233
Why not? The captain on a ship can.
It doesn't seem fair that--

579
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:45,668
Hey, what's wrong, kid?

580
00:45:52,217 --> 00:45:53,912
I love you so much.

581
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:59,079
And I hate this war so much.

582
00:46:01,026 --> 00:46:03,756
It's a crazy world.
Anything can happen.

583
00:46:05,397 --> 00:46:07,365
If you shouldn't get away...

584
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,466
If something should keep us apart...

585
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:14,270
...wherever they put you...

586
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:17,704
...and wherever I'll be,
I want you to know that I...

587
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:24,543
Kiss me.

588
00:46:24,983 --> 00:46:27,884
Kiss me as if it were the last time.

589
00:47:03,888 --> 00:47:05,355
Where is she?
Have you seen her?

590
00:47:05,523 --> 00:47:08,048
I can't find her.
She checked out of the hotel.

591
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:10,352
But this note came just after you left.

592
00:47:25,477 --> 00:47:27,172
That's the last call, Mr. Richard.

593
00:47:27,946 --> 00:47:29,436
Do you hear me?

594
00:47:30,148 --> 00:47:33,083
Come on, Mr. Richard.
Let's get out of here. Come on.

595
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:26,532
Rick, I have to talk to you.

596
00:48:27,939 --> 00:48:31,238
I saved my first drink
to have with you. Here.

597
00:48:31,943 --> 00:48:34,537
- No, Rick. Not tonight.
- Especially tonight.

598
00:48:36,014 --> 00:48:39,541
Why did you have to come to Casablanca?
There are other places.

599
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:42,117
I wouldn't have come
if I'd known you were here.

600
00:48:42,854 --> 00:48:44,822
Believe me, Rick, it's true.
I didn't know.

601
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:48,390
It's funny about your voice,
how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it.

602
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,653
"Richard, dear,
I'll go with you anyplace.

603
00:48:51,129 --> 00:48:54,496
- We'll get on a train and never stop."
- Don't, Rick.

604
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,197
I can understand how you feel.

605
00:48:58,069 --> 00:49:00,196
You understand how I feel.

606
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:02,668
How long was it we had, honey?

607
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:05,802
- I didn't count the days.
- Well, I did.

608
00:49:06,144 --> 00:49:07,543
Every one of them.

609
00:49:08,213 --> 00:49:10,113
Mostly I remember the last one.

610
00:49:11,149 --> 00:49:14,880
The wild finish. A guy standing
on a station platform in the rain...

611
00:49:15,053 --> 00:49:16,782
...with a comical look on his face...

612
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:18,946
...because his insides
have been kicked out.

613
00:49:20,992 --> 00:49:23,119
Can I tell you a story, Rick?

614
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,819
Does it got a wild finish?

615
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:28,124
I don't know the finish yet.

616
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:31,735
Go on, tell it. Maybe one'll come
to you as you go along.

617
00:49:34,205 --> 00:49:37,971
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris
from her home in Oslo.

618
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:39,871
At the house of some friends...

619
00:49:40,044 --> 00:49:42,911
...she met a man about whom
she'd heard her whole life.

620
00:49:43,081 --> 00:49:46,278
A very great and courageous man.

621
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:48,949
He opened up for her a whole
beautiful world...

622
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,714
...full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals.

623
00:49:52,123 --> 00:49:55,991
Everything she knew
or ever became was because of him.

624
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,923
And she looked up to him...

625
00:49:58,196 --> 00:49:59,663
...and worshiped him...

626
00:49:59,864 --> 00:50:02,662
...with a feeling she supposed was love.

627
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:04,961
Yes, that's very pretty.

628
00:50:05,136 --> 00:50:08,833
I heard a story once. In fact,
I've heard a lot of stories in my time.

629
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:11,805
They went along with the sound
of a tinny piano...

630
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:14,308
...playing in the parlor downstairs.

631
00:50:14,779 --> 00:50:19,807
"Mister, I met a man once
when I was a kid," they'd always begin.

632
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,886
I guess neither one of our stories
is very funny.

633
00:50:26,057 --> 00:50:27,149
Tell me...

634
00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:30,185
...who was it you left me for?

635
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:33,194
Was it Laszlo,
or were there others in between...

636
00:50:33,932 --> 00:50:36,264
...or aren't you the kind that tells?

637
00:51:01,593 --> 00:51:05,154
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the
letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.

638
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,696
I would suggest you search
the café immediately.

639
00:51:07,865 --> 00:51:10,925
If Rick has the letters, he's too smart
to let you find them there.

640
00:51:11,169 --> 00:51:13,194
You give him credit
for too much cleverness.

641
00:51:13,371 --> 00:51:15,965
My impression was he's just
another blundering American.

642
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,199
We mustn't underestimate
American blundering.

643
00:51:18,376 --> 00:51:22,312
I was with them when they blundered
into Berlin in 1918.

644
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,381
As to Laszlo,
we want him watched 24 hours a day.

645
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:29,384
It may interest you to know that
at this very moment he's on his way here.

646
00:51:34,459 --> 00:51:37,087
There is nothing we can do.

647
00:51:38,096 --> 00:51:40,792
I'm delighted to see you.
Did you have a good night's rest?

648
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:41,954
I slept very well.

649
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:44,727
Strange. Nobody's supposed
to sleep well in Casablanca.

650
00:51:46,004 --> 00:51:49,872
- May we proceed with the business?
- With pleasure. Won't you sit down?

651
00:51:52,076 --> 00:51:55,443
Laszlo, we will not mince words.
You're an escaped prisoner of the Reich.

652
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,945
So far you have been fortunate
in eluding us.

653
00:51:58,416 --> 00:51:59,940
You have reached Casablanca.

654
00:52:00,184 --> 00:52:02,880
It is my duty to see
that you stay in Casablanca.

655
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:05,214
Whether or not you will succeed
is problematic.

656
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:08,154
Not at all. Renault's signature
is necessary on every visa.

657
00:52:08,326 --> 00:52:11,022
Captain, is it possible that Laszlo
will receive a visa?

658
00:52:11,195 --> 00:52:13,527
I'm afraid not. My regrets, monsieur.

659
00:52:13,765 --> 00:52:15,790
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.

660
00:52:16,401 --> 00:52:18,096
And mademoiselle?

661
00:52:18,269 --> 00:52:21,796
- You needn't be concerned about me.
- Is that all you wish to tell us?

662
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:24,907
Don't be in such a hurry.
You have all the time in the world.

663
00:52:25,076 --> 00:52:27,738
You may be in Casablanca indefinitely.

664
00:52:27,912 --> 00:52:29,846
Or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow.

665
00:52:30,014 --> 00:52:32,209
- On one condition.
- And that is?

666
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:35,680
You know the leader of the underground
movement in Paris, in Prague...

667
00:52:35,887 --> 00:52:37,218
...Brussels, Amsterdam...

668
00:52:37,422 --> 00:52:39,686
...Oslo, Belgrade, Athens...

669
00:52:39,891 --> 00:52:42,451
- Even Berlin.
- Yes, even in Berlin.

670
00:52:42,627 --> 00:52:45,255
If you will furnish me with their names
and whereabouts...

671
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:47,193
...you'll have your visa in the morning.

672
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:50,127
And the honor of having served
the Third Reich.

673
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:53,030
I was in a German concentration camp
for a year.

674
00:52:53,538 --> 00:52:56,974
- That's honor enough for a lifetime.
- You will give us the names?

675
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:01,034
If I didn't give them to you
in a concentration camp...

676
00:53:01,245 --> 00:53:04,146
...where you had more persuasive methods
at your disposal...

677
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:06,942
...I certainly won't give them to you now.

678
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:09,784
And what if you track down
these men and kill them?

679
00:53:09,987 --> 00:53:11,511
What if you murdered all of us?

680
00:53:11,723 --> 00:53:16,057
From every corner of Europe, hundreds,
thousands would rise to take our places.

681
00:53:16,227 --> 00:53:18,559
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.

682
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:22,257
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for
eloquence which I can now understand.

683
00:53:22,433 --> 00:53:24,025
But in one aspect you are mistaken.

684
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:26,762
You said the enemies
of the Reich could all be replaced.

685
00:53:26,938 --> 00:53:28,462
But there is one exception.

686
00:53:28,673 --> 00:53:31,267
No one could take your place
if anything unfortunate...

687
00:53:31,442 --> 00:53:34,343
...should occur to you
while you were trying to escape.

688
00:53:34,746 --> 00:53:37,044
You won't dare to interfere with me here.

689
00:53:37,215 --> 00:53:38,773
This is still unoccupied France.

690
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:42,083
Any violation of neutrality
would reflect on Captain Renault.

691
00:53:42,253 --> 00:53:44,949
- Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power.
- Thank you.

692
00:53:45,123 --> 00:53:49,219
By the way, monsieur, last night
you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.

693
00:53:50,862 --> 00:53:53,729
I believe you have a message for him?

694
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:56,162
Nothing important.
But may I speak to him now?

695
00:53:56,701 --> 00:53:59,727
You would find the conversation
a trifle one-sided.

696
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:01,769
Signor Ugarte is dead.

697
00:54:08,377 --> 00:54:09,867
I'm making out the report now.

698
00:54:10,045 --> 00:54:12,639
We haven't quite decided
whether he committed suicide...

699
00:54:13,315 --> 00:54:15,180
...or died trying to escape.

700
00:54:16,818 --> 00:54:19,514
- Are you quite finished with us?
- For the time being.

701
00:54:19,721 --> 00:54:21,211
Good day.

702
00:54:25,627 --> 00:54:28,255
Undoubtedly, their next step will
be to the black market.

703
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:29,454
Excuse me, captain.

704
00:54:29,665 --> 00:54:32,657
Another visa problem has come up.

705
00:54:33,135 --> 00:54:36,036
- Show her in.
- Yes, sir.

706
00:54:44,713 --> 00:54:47,739
Sorry, monsieur, we were never
to handle the police.

707
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:50,680
- This is a job for Signor Ferrari.
- Ferrari?

708
00:54:50,852 --> 00:54:53,047
It can be most helpful
to know Signor Ferrari.

709
00:54:53,221 --> 00:54:55,849
He pretty near has a monopoly
on the black market here.

710
00:54:56,058 --> 00:54:58,117
You will find him at the Blue Parrot.

711
00:54:58,827 --> 00:55:00,454
Thanks.

712
00:55:12,307 --> 00:55:13,706
Don't be too downhearted.

713
00:55:13,909 --> 00:55:15,968
Perhaps you can come to terms with Renault.

714
00:55:16,144 --> 00:55:17,475
Thank you very much, signor.

715
00:55:17,646 --> 00:55:20,080
- Hello, Ferrari.
- Good morning, Rick.

716
00:55:20,248 --> 00:55:22,409
The bus is in.
I'll take my shipment with me.

717
00:55:22,617 --> 00:55:24,642
I'll have it sent over.
Have a drink with me.

718
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:29,052
I never drink in the morning. And every time
you send my shipment over it's a little short.

719
00:55:29,224 --> 00:55:31,192
Carrying charges, my boy.
Carrying charges.

720
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:32,656
Here, sit down.

721
00:55:32,861 --> 00:55:35,489
There is something I want
to talk over with you, anyhow.

722
00:55:35,664 --> 00:55:37,291
Bourbon.

723
00:55:37,566 --> 00:55:39,500
The news about Ugarte
upsets me very much.

724
00:55:39,668 --> 00:55:42,865
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel
any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.

725
00:55:43,271 --> 00:55:46,069
Of course not. What upsets me
is that Ugarte is dead...

726
00:55:46,241 --> 00:55:48,266
...and no one knows where
those letters are.

727
00:55:48,443 --> 00:55:49,740
Practically no one.

728
00:55:49,945 --> 00:55:52,209
If I had those letters,
I could make a fortune.

729
00:55:52,481 --> 00:55:54,540
So could I,
and I'm a poor businessman.

730
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:58,584
I have a proposition for whoever has those
letters. I'll handle the entire transaction.

731
00:55:58,754 --> 00:56:01,621
Get rid of the letters, take all the risk,
for a small percentage.

732
00:56:01,823 --> 00:56:03,313
And the carrying charges?

733
00:56:03,492 --> 00:56:06,256
Naturally there will be a few
incidental expenses.

734
00:56:06,962 --> 00:56:09,362
That's my proposition
for whoever has those letters.

735
00:56:09,531 --> 00:56:11,089
I'll tell him when he comes in.

736
00:56:11,266 --> 00:56:13,894
Rick, I think you know
where those letters are.

737
00:56:14,169 --> 00:56:17,366
You're in good company.
Renault and Strasser probably think so too.

738
00:56:23,078 --> 00:56:26,104
That's why I came here. To give
them a chance to ransack my place.

739
00:56:26,281 --> 00:56:29,614
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into
your confidence. You need a partner.

740
00:56:29,785 --> 00:56:31,719
Excuse me, I'll be getting back.

741
00:56:35,323 --> 00:56:39,054
- Morning.
- Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.

742
00:56:43,732 --> 00:56:46,360
You will not find a treasure like this
in all Morocco.

743
00:56:46,568 --> 00:56:47,865
Only 700 francs.

744
00:56:48,069 --> 00:56:51,232
- You're being cheated.
- Doesn't matter, thank you.

745
00:56:51,406 --> 00:56:54,534
For friends of Rick's
we have a small discount.

746
00:56:54,743 --> 00:56:57,268
Did I say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.

747
00:56:57,445 --> 00:57:01,108
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you
when you called on me last night.

748
00:57:01,283 --> 00:57:02,272
Doesn't matter.

749
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:06,386
For special friends of Rick's
we have a special discount. 100 francs.

750
00:57:06,555 --> 00:57:09,581
Your story had me a little confused.
Or maybe it was the bourbon.

751
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:11,383
I have some tablecloths, napkins--

752
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,256
- Thank you. I'm really not interested.
- Please, one minute.

753
00:57:14,429 --> 00:57:18,058
Why did you come back? To tell me why you
ran out on me at the railway station?

754
00:57:18,233 --> 00:57:19,257
Yes.

755
00:57:19,434 --> 00:57:21,800
Well, you can tell me now.
I'm reasonably sober.

756
00:57:22,037 --> 00:57:23,561
I don't think I will, Rick.

757
00:57:23,738 --> 00:57:28,038
Why not? After all, I got stuck with
a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.

758
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:30,405
Last night I saw
what has happened to you.

759
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:34,310
The Rick I knew in Paris,
I could tell him, he'd understand.

760
00:57:34,482 --> 00:57:37,042
But the one who looked at me
with such hatred...

761
00:57:38,587 --> 00:57:41,613
I'll be leaving Casablanca soon.
We'll never see each other again.

762
00:57:42,757 --> 00:57:46,818
We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris.

763
00:57:46,995 --> 00:57:51,796
If we leave it that way, maybe we'll
remember those days and not Casablanca.

764
00:57:52,267 --> 00:57:53,393
Not last night.

765
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:57,300
Did you run out on me because
you knew what it would be like?

766
00:57:57,472 --> 00:58:00,373
Hiding from the police,
running away all the time?

767
00:58:00,542 --> 00:58:02,237
You can believe that if you want to.

768
00:58:02,444 --> 00:58:05,174
Well, I'm not running away anymore.
I'm settled now.

769
00:58:05,347 --> 00:58:07,144
Above a saloon, it's true...

770
00:58:07,349 --> 00:58:08,782
...but walk up a flight...

771
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:10,679
...I'll be expecting you.

772
00:58:12,754 --> 00:58:15,552
All the same,
someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

773
00:58:15,724 --> 00:58:17,453
You'll be there.

774
00:58:18,994 --> 00:58:20,018
No, Rick.

775
00:58:21,429 --> 00:58:23,693
No. You see, Victor Laszlo
is my husband.

776
00:58:24,733 --> 00:58:28,294
And was,
even when I knew you in Paris.

777
00:58:32,874 --> 00:58:37,436
I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo
that unfortunately I'm not able to help him.

778
00:58:37,612 --> 00:58:39,512
You see, my dear, word has gone around.

779
00:58:39,714 --> 00:58:44,276
As leader of all illegal activities in
Casablanca, I am influential and respected.

780
00:58:44,452 --> 00:58:47,888
But it would not be worth my life
to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.

781
00:58:48,056 --> 00:58:49,887
You, however, are a different matter.

782
00:58:50,325 --> 00:58:54,694
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible
to get an exit visa for you.

783
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:58,258
- You mean for me to go on alone?
- And only alone.

784
00:58:58,466 --> 00:59:01,731
I'll stay here and keep on trying.
I'm sure in a little while--

785
00:59:01,903 --> 00:59:03,700
Might as well be frank, monsieur.

786
00:59:03,872 --> 00:59:07,330
It would take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

787
00:59:07,809 --> 00:59:09,936
We are only interested in two visas.

788
00:59:10,111 --> 00:59:12,375
- Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
- No, Victor.

789
00:59:12,714 --> 00:59:14,807
You two will want to discuss this.

790
00:59:14,983 --> 00:59:16,951
Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.

791
00:59:20,822 --> 00:59:22,619
No, Ilsa.
I won't let you stay here.

792
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:26,158
You must get to America. Believe me,
somehow I will get out and join you.

793
00:59:26,394 --> 00:59:28,191
But if the situation were different...

794
00:59:28,363 --> 00:59:30,923
...if I had to stay
and there were only visa for one...

795
00:59:31,099 --> 00:59:32,396
...would you take it?

796
00:59:33,601 --> 00:59:34,693
Yes, I would.

797
00:59:35,904 --> 00:59:37,098
Yes, I see.

798
00:59:38,273 --> 00:59:42,175
When I had trouble getting out of Lille,
why didn't you leave me there?

799
00:59:42,344 --> 00:59:46,405
When I was sick in Marseilles for two weeks
and you were in danger every minute...

800
00:59:46,581 --> 00:59:48,378
...why didn't you leave me then?

801
00:59:49,684 --> 00:59:52,175
I meant to,
but something always held me up.

802
00:59:54,656 --> 00:59:56,123
I love you very much, Ilsa.

803
00:59:57,325 --> 00:59:59,418
Your secret will be safe with me.

804
01:00:00,495 --> 01:00:02,588
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

805
01:00:02,764 --> 01:00:05,096
Not more than 50 francs.

806
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:11,635
We've decided, Signor Ferrari.

807
01:00:11,806 --> 01:00:15,173
For the present we will go on looking
for two visas. Thank you very much.

808
01:00:15,343 --> 01:00:17,311
Well, good luck, but be careful.

809
01:00:17,479 --> 01:00:20,312
- You know you're being shadowed?
- Of course. It becomes an instinct.

810
01:00:20,648 --> 01:00:23,674
I observe that you, in one respect,
are a very fortunate man.

811
01:00:23,885 --> 01:00:26,581
I am moved to make one more suggestion.
Why, I do not know.

812
01:00:26,755 --> 01:00:28,655
Because it cannot possibly profit me.

813
01:00:28,857 --> 01:00:32,020
Have you heard about Ugarte
and the letters of transit?

814
01:00:32,193 --> 01:00:33,182
Yes, something.

815
01:00:33,361 --> 01:00:36,558
Those letters were not found on Ugarte
when they arrested him.

816
01:00:36,731 --> 01:00:38,722
- You know where they are?
- Not for sure.

817
01:00:38,933 --> 01:00:41,959
But I'd guess that Ugarte
left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

818
01:00:43,872 --> 01:00:47,069
A difficult customer, that Rick.
One never knows what he'll do or why.

819
01:00:47,275 --> 01:00:48,902
But it is worth a chance.

820
01:00:49,477 --> 01:00:52,275
Thank you very much.
Good day.

821
01:00:52,514 --> 01:00:56,211
Goodbye. Thank you for your coffee.
I shall miss that when we leave Casablanca.

822
01:00:56,384 --> 01:00:59,251
Gracious of you to share it with me.
Good day, mademoiselle.

823
01:00:59,421 --> 01:01:01,855
- Monsieur.
- Good day.

824
01:01:11,266 --> 01:01:12,893
- Here's to you, sir.
- Good luck.

825
01:01:13,401 --> 01:01:15,232
- I'd better be going.
- My check, please.

826
01:01:15,437 --> 01:01:19,168
I have to warn you, sir.
This is a dangerous place. Full of vultures.

827
01:01:19,374 --> 01:01:22,207
- Vultures everywhere. Thanks for everything.
- Goodbye.

828
01:01:22,377 --> 01:01:24,004
It has been a pleasure to meet you.

829
01:01:24,179 --> 01:01:25,840
I'm sorry.

830
01:01:41,696 --> 01:01:45,393
Monsieur Rick,
you are getting to be your best customer.

831
01:01:47,435 --> 01:01:49,801
Well, drinking.
I'm very pleased with you.

832
01:01:49,971 --> 01:01:51,871
You're beginning
to live like a Frenchman.

833
01:01:52,073 --> 01:01:54,405
That was some going-over
your men gave my place.

834
01:01:54,576 --> 01:01:56,567
We barely got cleaned up
in time to open.

835
01:01:56,744 --> 01:01:59,008
I told Strasser he wouldn't
find the letters here.

836
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:01,307
But I told my men
to be especially destructive.

837
01:02:01,483 --> 01:02:03,417
You know how
that impresses Germans.

838
01:02:04,752 --> 01:02:07,050
Rick, have you got
those letters of transit?

839
01:02:07,422 --> 01:02:09,515
Louis, are you Pro-Vichy
or Free French?

840
01:02:10,158 --> 01:02:14,618
Serves me right for asking a direct question.
The subject is closed.

841
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:17,394
It looks like you're a little late.

842
01:02:24,706 --> 01:02:26,367
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

843
01:02:26,541 --> 01:02:30,307
Who knows? In her own way,
she may constitute an entire second front.

844
01:02:30,712 --> 01:02:34,204
I think it's time for me to flatter
Strasser a little. I'll see you later.

845
01:02:35,049 --> 01:02:36,482
Sascha!

846
01:02:36,651 --> 01:02:37,675
French 75s.

847
01:02:37,886 --> 01:02:41,549
Put up a whole row of them, Sascha.
Starting here and ending here.

848
01:02:41,723 --> 01:02:43,054
We will begin with two.

849
01:02:52,133 --> 01:02:54,328
What did you say?
Would you kindly repeat it?

850
01:02:54,536 --> 01:02:57,903
- What I said is none of your business.
- I'll make it my business.

851
01:03:04,078 --> 01:03:07,741
I don't like disturbances in my place.
Either lay off politics or get out.

852
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:13,678
You see, captain?

853
01:03:13,922 --> 01:03:16,322
The situation is not as under control
as you believe.

854
01:03:16,524 --> 01:03:18,389
We try to cooperate
with your government.

855
01:03:18,593 --> 01:03:20,857
But we cannot regulate
the feelings of our people.

856
01:03:21,029 --> 01:03:23,190
Captain, are you certain
which side you're on?

857
01:03:23,498 --> 01:03:25,659
I have no conviction,
if that's what you mean.

858
01:03:25,867 --> 01:03:27,164
I blow with the wind...

859
01:03:27,335 --> 01:03:29,735
...and the prevailing wind
happens to be from Vichy.

860
01:03:29,938 --> 01:03:31,633
And if it should change?

861
01:03:31,906 --> 01:03:34,067
Surely the Reich doesn't admit
that possibility?

862
01:03:34,242 --> 01:03:36,335
We are concerned
about more than Casablanca.

863
01:03:36,544 --> 01:03:39,945
We know that every French province
in Africa is honeycombed with traitors.

864
01:03:40,448 --> 01:03:43,144
Waiting for their chance.
Waiting perhaps for a leader.

865
01:03:43,318 --> 01:03:44,876
A leader? Like Laszlo?

866
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,851
I have been thinking.

867
01:03:47,188 --> 01:03:50,487
It's too dangerous to let him go,
it may be too dangerous to let him stay.

868
01:03:50,658 --> 01:03:51,647
I see what you mean.

869
01:03:57,565 --> 01:03:59,430
Thank you, Carl.

870
01:03:59,634 --> 01:04:01,864
Thank you, Carl.

871
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:04,004
Sit down. Have a brandy with us.

872
01:04:04,339 --> 01:04:06,773
To celebrate our leaving
for America tomorrow.

873
01:04:06,941 --> 01:04:08,033
Thank you very much.

874
01:04:08,243 --> 01:04:10,973
I thought you would ask me,
so I brought the good brandy...

875
01:04:11,179 --> 01:04:13,010
...and a third glass.

876
01:04:13,181 --> 01:04:15,172
At last the day's came!

877
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:18,183
Frau Leuchtag and I
are speaking nothing but English now.

878
01:04:18,353 --> 01:04:21,220
So we should feel at home
when we get to America.

879
01:04:21,389 --> 01:04:23,050
A very nice idea.

880
01:04:23,391 --> 01:04:24,619
To America.

881
01:04:25,393 --> 01:04:26,382
To America.

882
01:04:33,968 --> 01:04:35,367
What watch?

883
01:04:36,237 --> 01:04:39,229
- Ten watch.
- Such much?

884
01:04:40,875 --> 01:04:43,207
You will get along beautifully in America.

885
01:04:44,212 --> 01:04:45,975
How is lady luck treating you?

886
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:48,011
Oh, too bad.

887
01:04:48,349 --> 01:04:50,214
You'll find him over there.

888
01:04:56,457 --> 01:04:57,981
- Monsieur Rick?
- Yes?

889
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:01,390
- Could I speak to you, please?
- How'd you get in here? You're underage.

890
01:05:01,562 --> 01:05:03,894
- I came with Captain Renault.
- I should have known.

891
01:05:04,065 --> 01:05:05,396
My husband is with me too.

892
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,330
He is? Captain Renault's getting
broad-minded. Sit down.

893
01:05:08,503 --> 01:05:09,492
Have a drink?

894
01:05:09,671 --> 01:05:12,367
No, of course not. You mind if I do?

895
01:05:12,974 --> 01:05:14,032
Monsieur Rick...

896
01:05:14,742 --> 01:05:18,337
- ...what kind of a man is Captain Renault?
- Like any other man, only more so.

897
01:05:18,513 --> 01:05:19,502
No, I mean...

898
01:05:19,847 --> 01:05:21,508
...is he trustworthy?
Is his word--?

899
01:05:21,883 --> 01:05:25,819
- Just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
- He did. Captain Renault did.

900
01:05:25,987 --> 01:05:28,046
I thought so. Where's your husband?

901
01:05:28,323 --> 01:05:32,589
At the roulette table,
trying to win enough for our exit visas.

902
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,557
Oh, of course he's losing.

903
01:05:34,796 --> 01:05:37,697
- How long have you been married?
- Eight weeks.

904
01:05:38,733 --> 01:05:40,360
We come from Bulgaria.

905
01:05:40,968 --> 01:05:43,198
Things are very bad there.

906
01:05:43,371 --> 01:05:45,566
The devil has the people
by the throat.

907
01:05:45,973 --> 01:05:48,498
So Jan and I, we...

908
01:05:48,676 --> 01:05:51,372
We do not want our children
to grow up in such a country.

909
01:05:51,579 --> 01:05:53,945
- So you decided to go to America.
- Yes.

910
01:05:54,115 --> 01:05:56,515
But we haven't much money...

911
01:05:56,684 --> 01:05:59,152
...and traveling is so expensive
and difficult.

912
01:05:59,554 --> 01:06:01,579
It was much more than we thought
to get here.

913
01:06:02,256 --> 01:06:04,121
And then Captain Renault sees us...

914
01:06:04,325 --> 01:06:07,294
- ...and he is so kind, he wants to help us.
- Yes, I'll bet.

915
01:06:07,595 --> 01:06:10,655
He tells me he can give us an exit visa.

916
01:06:11,065 --> 01:06:12,464
But we have no money.

917
01:06:12,767 --> 01:06:14,359
- Does he know that?
- Yes.

918
01:06:14,535 --> 01:06:16,867
- And he's still willing to give you a visa?
- Yes.

919
01:06:17,038 --> 01:06:20,007
- And you want to know...?
- Will he keep his word?

920
01:06:21,109 --> 01:06:22,201
He always has.

921
01:06:27,382 --> 01:06:29,407
You are a man.

922
01:06:29,584 --> 01:06:32,246
If someone loved you very much...

923
01:06:32,453 --> 01:06:36,685
...so that your happiness was the only thing
that she wanted in the world...

924
01:06:37,258 --> 01:06:40,125
...and she did a bad thing
to make certain of it...

925
01:06:40,628 --> 01:06:43,722
- ...could you forgive her?
- Nobody ever loved me that much.

926
01:06:43,898 --> 01:06:47,732
And he never knew, and the girl kept
this bad thing locked in her heart...

927
01:06:47,902 --> 01:06:49,699
...that would be all right,
wouldn't it?

928
01:06:49,871 --> 01:06:51,998
- You want my advice?
- Yes, please.

929
01:06:52,507 --> 01:06:53,599
Go back to Bulgaria.

930
01:06:53,841 --> 01:06:58,073
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us
to leave Europe, to get to America...

931
01:06:59,313 --> 01:07:03,409
Oh, but if Jan should find out.
He is such a boy.

932
01:07:03,584 --> 01:07:07,020
In many ways
I am so much older than he is.

933
01:07:07,188 --> 01:07:09,588
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca
has problems.

934
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:12,919
- Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
- Thank you, monsieur.

935
01:07:21,636 --> 01:07:22,933
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

936
01:07:23,104 --> 01:07:26,631
- You see? Here we are again.
- I take that as a great compliment to Sam.

937
01:07:26,808 --> 01:07:30,039
I suppose he means to you
Paris of happier days.

938
01:07:30,611 --> 01:07:33,774
He does. Could we
have a table close to him?

939
01:07:33,981 --> 01:07:36,313
And as far away
from Major Strasser as possible.

940
01:07:36,651 --> 01:07:39,142
The geography may be
a little difficult to arrange.

941
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:41,083
- Paul, table 30.
- Yes, sir.

942
01:07:41,255 --> 01:07:43,052
Right this way, if you please.

943
01:07:43,224 --> 01:07:46,990
I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By."
I believe that's your favorite tune.

944
01:07:47,228 --> 01:07:48,490
Thank you.

945
01:07:57,905 --> 01:08:00,533
- Two cognacs, please.
- Cognac.

946
01:08:23,631 --> 01:08:26,191
Do you wish to place another bet, sir?

947
01:08:26,734 --> 01:08:28,463
No. No, I guess not.

948
01:08:28,636 --> 01:08:30,501
Have you tried 22 tonight?

949
01:08:32,073 --> 01:08:33,472
I said 22.

950
01:08:49,824 --> 01:08:51,155
Leave it there.

951
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:08,005
Cash it in and don't come back.

952
01:09:10,778 --> 01:09:12,769
Are you sure this place is honest?

953
01:09:13,347 --> 01:09:17,181
Honest? As honest as the day is long.

954
01:09:20,121 --> 01:09:21,452
How are we doing tonight?

955
01:09:21,789 --> 01:09:24,451
A couple of thousand less
than I thought there would be.

956
01:09:28,162 --> 01:09:30,130
Monsieur Rick...

957
01:09:35,169 --> 01:09:36,796
He's just a lucky guy.

958
01:09:39,507 --> 01:09:42,408
Monsieur Rick,
may I get you a cup of coffee?

959
01:09:42,577 --> 01:09:44,636
- No, thanks, Carl.
- Monsieur Rick...

960
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:49,639
Captain Renault, may I--?

961
01:09:49,817 --> 01:09:53,776
Not here. Come to my office in the morning.
We'll do everything businesslike.

962
01:09:53,955 --> 01:09:56,685
- We'll be there at 6.
- I'll be there at 10.

963
01:09:56,857 --> 01:09:58,722
I'm very happy for both of you.

964
01:09:58,893 --> 01:10:00,986
Still, it's very strange that you won.

965
01:10:01,162 --> 01:10:03,426
Well, maybe not so strange.

966
01:10:03,598 --> 01:10:06,431
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Thank you, Captain Renault.

967
01:10:06,834 --> 01:10:08,426
No!

968
01:10:14,141 --> 01:10:17,042
Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.

969
01:10:17,812 --> 01:10:20,246
Go away, you crazy Russian.

970
01:10:30,191 --> 01:10:33,957
- As I suspected. You're a rank sentimentalist.
- Yeah? Why?

971
01:10:34,128 --> 01:10:36,323
Why do you interfere
with my little romances?

972
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:38,361
Put it down as a gesture to love.

973
01:10:38,532 --> 01:10:40,056
Well, I'll forgive you this time.

974
01:10:40,267 --> 01:10:43,100
But I'll be in tomorrow night
with a breathtaking blond.

975
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:45,465
And it'll make me very happy if she loses.

976
01:10:49,543 --> 01:10:52,671
- Mr. Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you.
- Go ahead.

977
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,472
Well, isn't there some other place?

978
01:10:54,682 --> 01:10:57,173
It's rather confidential,
what I have to say.

979
01:10:59,153 --> 01:11:01,383
- In my office.
- Right.

980
01:11:02,456 --> 01:11:05,118
You must know it's very important
I get out of Casablanca.

981
01:11:05,292 --> 01:11:08,284
It's my privilege to be one of the leaders
of a great movement.

982
01:11:08,462 --> 01:11:10,225
You know what I've been doing.

983
01:11:10,398 --> 01:11:14,334
You know what it means to the work,
to the lives of thousands of people...

984
01:11:14,502 --> 01:11:16,766
...that I reach America
and continue my work.

985
01:11:16,937 --> 01:11:18,370
I'm not interested in politics.

986
01:11:18,539 --> 01:11:21,030
The problems of the world
are not in my department.

987
01:11:21,308 --> 01:11:22,400
I'm a saloonkeeper.

988
01:11:22,743 --> 01:11:26,304
My friends in the underground tell me
that you have quite a record.

989
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,004
You ran guns to Ethiopia.

990
01:11:28,182 --> 01:11:31,049
- You fought against the fascists in Spain.
- What of it?

991
01:11:31,218 --> 01:11:34,381
Isn't it strange you're always
fighting on the side of the underdog?

992
01:11:34,588 --> 01:11:36,522
Yes, I found that a very expensive hobby.

993
01:11:36,724 --> 01:11:38,954
But then I never was
much of a businessman.

994
01:11:39,126 --> 01:11:42,493
Are you enough of a businessman
to appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs?

995
01:11:42,663 --> 01:11:45,530
- I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
- 200,000.

996
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:48,425
My friend, you could make it
a million francs or three.

997
01:11:48,636 --> 01:11:50,433
My answer would still be the same.

998
01:11:50,604 --> 01:11:52,765
There must be some reason
why you won't let me.

999
01:11:52,973 --> 01:11:54,099
There is.

1000
01:11:54,575 --> 01:11:56,702
I suggest that you ask your wife.

1001
01:11:57,011 --> 01:11:59,639
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, ask your wife.

1002
01:12:00,014 --> 01:12:02,414
- My wife?
- Yes.

1003
01:12:42,823 --> 01:12:44,814
Play "La Marseillaise."
Play it!

1004
01:14:00,868 --> 01:14:04,861
See what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in
a café can inspire this demonstration...

1005
01:14:05,039 --> 01:14:07,507
...what more will his presence
in Casablanca bring on?

1006
01:14:07,675 --> 01:14:09,666
I advise that this place
be shut up at once.

1007
01:14:09,944 --> 01:14:12,913
- But everybody's having a good time.
- Yes, much too good a time.

1008
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,274
The place is to be closed.

1009
01:14:14,448 --> 01:14:17,508
- But I have no excuse to close it.
- Find one.

1010
01:14:22,423 --> 01:14:24,050
Everybody is to leave immediately.

1011
01:14:24,291 --> 01:14:26,521
This café is closed until further notice.

1012
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,352
Clear the room at once.

1013
01:14:31,799 --> 01:14:33,164
How can you close me up?

1014
01:14:33,367 --> 01:14:36,825
I'm shocked, shocked to find that
gambling is going on in here.

1015
01:14:37,004 --> 01:14:38,904
- Your winnings, sir.
- Thank you.

1016
01:14:39,073 --> 01:14:40,335
Everybody out at once.

1017
01:14:44,778 --> 01:14:48,714
After this disturbance it is not safe
for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

1018
01:14:48,883 --> 01:14:51,681
This morning you implied it wasn't safe
to leave Casablanca.

1019
01:14:51,852 --> 01:14:54,787
That is also true, except for one destination:
occupied France.

1020
01:14:54,989 --> 01:14:57,890
- Occupied France?
- Under safe conduct from me.

1021
01:14:58,125 --> 01:14:59,114
Of what value is that?

1022
01:14:59,293 --> 01:15:02,319
You may recall what German guarantees
have been worth in the past.

1023
01:15:02,496 --> 01:15:05,761
- There are two other alternatives for him.
- What are they?

1024
01:15:05,933 --> 01:15:10,233
The French authorities may find a reason
to put him in the concentration camp here.

1025
01:15:10,404 --> 01:15:11,496
The other alternative?

1026
01:15:11,672 --> 01:15:16,439
My dear, perhaps you have already observed
that in Casablanca human life is cheap.

1027
01:15:16,610 --> 01:15:17,941
Good night, mademoiselle.

1028
01:15:28,656 --> 01:15:32,148
- What happened with Rick?
- We'll discuss it later.

1029
01:15:55,082 --> 01:15:57,073
Our faithful friend is still there.

1030
01:15:57,618 --> 01:16:00,143
Please don't go
to the underground meeting tonight.

1031
01:16:00,387 --> 01:16:01,479
I must.

1032
01:16:01,655 --> 01:16:05,113
Besides, it isn't often that a man gets
to display heroics before his wife.

1033
01:16:05,292 --> 01:16:08,625
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's
warning tonight, I'm frightened.

1034
01:16:08,829 --> 01:16:10,660
Tell you the truth,
I'm frightened too.

1035
01:16:10,831 --> 01:16:13,265
Shall I remain here
in a hotel room, hiding?

1036
01:16:13,467 --> 01:16:15,094
Or shall I carry on the best I can?

1037
01:16:15,502 --> 01:16:18,164
Whatever I'd say,
you would carry on.

1038
01:16:19,039 --> 01:16:21,974
Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick?
What did you find out?

1039
01:16:22,142 --> 01:16:24,508
- Apparently he has the letters.
- Yes?

1040
01:16:24,678 --> 01:16:26,236
But no intention of selling them.

1041
01:16:26,413 --> 01:16:30,110
You'd think if sentiment
wouldn't persuade him, money would.

1042
01:16:30,284 --> 01:16:31,842
Did he give any reason?

1043
01:16:32,052 --> 01:16:35,317
- He suggested I ask you.
- Ask me?

1044
01:16:35,522 --> 01:16:37,683
Yes, he said, "Ask your wife."

1045
01:16:38,659 --> 01:16:40,422
I don't know why he said that.

1046
01:16:52,973 --> 01:16:55,703
Well, our friend outside will think
we've retired by now.

1047
01:16:57,077 --> 01:16:58,908
I'll be going in a few minutes.

1048
01:17:00,981 --> 01:17:03,472
- Ilsa, I...
- Yes?

1049
01:17:04,752 --> 01:17:07,016
When I was in the concentration camp...

1050
01:17:07,588 --> 01:17:10,113
...were you lonely in Paris?

1051
01:17:11,592 --> 01:17:13,583
Yes, Victor, I was.

1052
01:17:14,561 --> 01:17:17,530
I know how it is to be lonely.

1053
01:17:18,599 --> 01:17:20,931
Is there anything you wish to tell me?

1054
01:17:22,936 --> 01:17:24,927
No, Victor, there isn't.

1055
01:17:29,576 --> 01:17:32,101
I love you very much, my dear.

1056
01:17:35,449 --> 01:17:37,440
Yes, I know.

1057
01:17:38,285 --> 01:17:40,719
Victor, whatever I do,
will you believe that I...?

1058
01:17:40,888 --> 01:17:43,584
You don't even have to say it.

1059
01:17:43,757 --> 01:17:45,520
I'll believe.

1060
01:17:47,628 --> 01:17:48,959
Good night, dear.

1061
01:17:50,964 --> 01:17:52,295
Good night.

1062
01:17:59,339 --> 01:18:02,001
- Victor.
- Yes, dear?

1063
01:18:07,314 --> 01:18:08,679
Be careful.

1064
01:18:10,284 --> 01:18:11,842
Of course I'll be careful.

1065
01:18:55,195 --> 01:18:58,392
Well, you are in
pretty good shape, Herr Rick.

1066
01:18:58,565 --> 01:19:00,362
How long can I afford to stay closed?

1067
01:19:01,034 --> 01:19:02,331
Two weeks, maybe three.

1068
01:19:02,536 --> 01:19:04,766
Maybe I won't have to.
A bribe has worked before.

1069
01:19:04,972 --> 01:19:07,202
In the meantime,
everybody stays on salary.

1070
01:19:07,374 --> 01:19:08,739
Thank you, Herr Rick.

1071
01:19:08,909 --> 01:19:12,276
Sascha will be happy to hear it.
I owe him money.

1072
01:19:12,846 --> 01:19:15,679
- You finish locking up, will you, Carl?
- I will.

1073
01:19:15,849 --> 01:19:18,977
- Then I am going to the meeting--
- Don't tell me where you're going.

1074
01:19:19,153 --> 01:19:20,347
I won't.

1075
01:19:21,522 --> 01:19:22,580
Good night.

1076
01:19:23,724 --> 01:19:25,316
Good night, Mr. Rick.

1077
01:19:41,975 --> 01:19:45,376
- How did you get in?
- The stairs from the street.

1078
01:19:45,546 --> 01:19:48,879
I told you this morning you'd come around,
but this is ahead of schedule.

1079
01:19:49,049 --> 01:19:50,277
Well, won't you sit down?

1080
01:19:50,484 --> 01:19:54,386
- Richard, I had to see you.
- "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.

1081
01:19:54,555 --> 01:19:57,854
Your visit isn't connected
by any chance with the letters of transit?

1082
01:19:58,058 --> 01:20:00,754
Seems as long as I have those letters
I'll never be lonely.

1083
01:20:00,928 --> 01:20:03,556
Ask any price you want,
but you must give me the letters.

1084
01:20:03,730 --> 01:20:06,290
I went all through that
with your husband. It's no deal.

1085
01:20:06,867 --> 01:20:08,596
I know how you feel about me...

1086
01:20:08,769 --> 01:20:11,533
...but put your feelings aside
for something more important.

1087
01:20:11,705 --> 01:20:14,173
I have to hear again
what a great man your husband is...

1088
01:20:14,341 --> 01:20:16,332
...what an important cause
he's fighting for?

1089
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:17,841
It was your cause too.

1090
01:20:18,045 --> 01:20:20,513
In your own way, you were fighting
for the same thing.

1091
01:20:20,948 --> 01:20:23,644
I'm not fighting for anything
anymore except myself.

1092
01:20:23,884 --> 01:20:25,875
I'm the only cause I'm interested in.

1093
01:20:32,459 --> 01:20:35,986
We loved each other once.
If those days meant anything at all to you--

1094
01:20:36,163 --> 01:20:39,098
I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you.
It's poor salesmanship.

1095
01:20:39,266 --> 01:20:42,724
Listen to me. If you knew what really
happened, if you only knew the truth--

1096
01:20:42,903 --> 01:20:44,962
I wouldn't believe you
no matter what you said.

1097
01:20:45,138 --> 01:20:48,164
You'd say anything now
to get what you want.

1098
01:20:52,412 --> 01:20:55,142
You want to feel sorry for yourself,
don't you?

1099
01:20:55,315 --> 01:20:58,079
With so much at stake
all you can think of is your feelings.

1100
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:02,815
One woman has hurt you, and you
take your revenge on the rest of the world.

1101
01:21:02,990 --> 01:21:05,515
You're a coward and a weakling.

1102
01:21:08,929 --> 01:21:11,796
No. Oh, Richard. I'm sorry.

1103
01:21:12,866 --> 01:21:15,835
I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.

1104
01:21:16,003 --> 01:21:18,699
If you don't help us,
Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

1105
01:21:18,939 --> 01:21:19,928
What of it?

1106
01:21:20,107 --> 01:21:22,769
I'm going to die in Casablanca.
It's a good spot for it.

1107
01:21:29,616 --> 01:21:31,447
Now, if you'll--

1108
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:35,117
All right.

1109
01:21:35,289 --> 01:21:37,314
I tried to reason with you.

1110
01:21:37,491 --> 01:21:39,721
I tried everything.
Now, I want those letters.

1111
01:21:40,127 --> 01:21:43,255
- Get them for me.
- I don't have to. I got them right here.

1112
01:21:44,831 --> 01:21:46,696
Put them on the table.

1113
01:21:48,602 --> 01:21:49,591
No.

1114
01:21:50,704 --> 01:21:52,797
For the last time,
put them on the table.

1115
01:21:54,107 --> 01:21:58,100
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you, you won't stop at anything.

1116
01:21:59,513 --> 01:22:01,504
All right,
I'll make it easier for you.

1117
01:22:03,950 --> 01:22:07,647
Go ahead and shoot.
You'll be doing me a favor.

1118
01:22:12,559 --> 01:22:14,459
Richard...

1119
01:22:14,628 --> 01:22:16,994
...I tried to stay away.

1120
01:22:17,364 --> 01:22:20,026
I thought I would never see you again.

1121
01:22:21,168 --> 01:22:23,636
That you were out of my life.

1122
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:45,915
The day you left Paris...

1123
01:22:47,494 --> 01:22:49,485
...if you knew what I went through.

1124
01:22:51,164 --> 01:22:53,826
If you knew how much I loved you.

1125
01:22:54,835 --> 01:22:57,668
How much I still love you.

1126
01:23:11,551 --> 01:23:12,575
And then?

1127
01:23:14,621 --> 01:23:18,955
It wasn't long after we were married
that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

1128
01:23:19,126 --> 01:23:22,653
They needed him in Prague,
but there the Gestapo were waiting for him.

1129
01:23:22,829 --> 01:23:24,558
Just a two-line item in the paper:

1130
01:23:24,731 --> 01:23:27,359
"Victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp."

1131
01:23:28,535 --> 01:23:30,867
I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word.

1132
01:23:31,138 --> 01:23:32,366
Then it came.

1133
01:23:32,572 --> 01:23:34,733
He was dead.
Shot trying to escape.

1134
01:23:36,042 --> 01:23:38,533
I was lonely.
I had nothing, not even hope.

1135
01:23:39,946 --> 01:23:41,379
Then I met you.

1136
01:23:41,715 --> 01:23:45,048
Why weren't you honest with me?
Why did you keep your marriage a secret?

1137
01:23:45,252 --> 01:23:48,312
It wasn't my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.

1138
01:23:48,522 --> 01:23:51,047
Not even our closest friends
knew about our marriage.

1139
01:23:51,491 --> 01:23:54,460
That was his way of protecting me.
I knew so much about his work.

1140
01:23:54,661 --> 01:23:57,960
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife
it would be dangerous for me...

1141
01:23:58,131 --> 01:23:59,655
...and for those working with us.

1142
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:02,632
And when did you first find out
he was alive?

1143
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:06,195
Just before you and I
were to leave Paris together.

1144
01:24:06,373 --> 01:24:08,807
A friend came and told me
that Victor was alive.

1145
01:24:08,975 --> 01:24:12,103
They were hiding him in a freight car
on the outskirts of Paris.

1146
01:24:12,446 --> 01:24:14,437
He was sick. He needed me.

1147
01:24:16,016 --> 01:24:18,644
I wanted to tell you,
but I didn't dare.

1148
01:24:18,819 --> 01:24:22,778
I knew you wouldn't have left Paris,
and the Gestapo would have caught you.

1149
01:24:23,824 --> 01:24:25,553
Well...

1150
01:24:25,892 --> 01:24:27,553
...well, you know the rest.

1151
01:24:30,530 --> 01:24:33,590
Well, it's still a story without an ending.

1152
01:24:33,767 --> 01:24:34,893
What about now?

1153
01:24:36,136 --> 01:24:37,125
Now?

1154
01:24:37,938 --> 01:24:39,462
I don't know.

1155
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:43,166
I know that I'll never have the strength
to leave you again.

1156
01:24:44,377 --> 01:24:45,435
And Laszlo?

1157
01:24:45,812 --> 01:24:49,043
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.

1158
01:24:49,216 --> 01:24:52,549
Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.

1159
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:54,209
All except one.

1160
01:24:55,689 --> 01:24:57,122
He won't have you.

1161
01:24:59,259 --> 01:25:01,022
I can't fight it anymore.

1162
01:25:02,796 --> 01:25:05,128
I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.

1163
01:25:08,101 --> 01:25:11,161
Oh, I don't know
what's right any longer.

1164
01:25:11,338 --> 01:25:13,397
You have to think for both of us.

1165
01:25:14,407 --> 01:25:15,806
For all of us.

1166
01:25:19,412 --> 01:25:22,074
All right. I will.

1167
01:25:26,219 --> 01:25:27,914
Here's looking at you, kid.

1168
01:25:29,723 --> 01:25:32,817
I wish I didn't love you so much.

1169
01:25:45,205 --> 01:25:47,264
- I think we lost them.
- Yes.

1170
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:50,603
- I'm afraid they caught some of the others.
- Come inside.

1171
01:25:54,915 --> 01:25:59,784
Come, Mr. Laszlo,
I will help you immediately.

1172
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:01,783
Thank you.

1173
01:26:19,239 --> 01:26:21,400
Carl, what happened?

1174
01:26:21,575 --> 01:26:25,204
The police break up our meeting, Herr Rick.
We escaped at the last moment.

1175
01:26:25,412 --> 01:26:27,710
- Come up here a minute.
- Yes, I come.

1176
01:26:27,881 --> 01:26:31,180
Turn out the light in the rear entrance.
It might attract the police.

1177
01:26:31,384 --> 01:26:34,080
- But Sascha always puts out that light.
- Tonight he forgot.

1178
01:26:34,788 --> 01:26:37,018
Yes, I come. I will do it.

1179
01:26:44,698 --> 01:26:48,190
- I want you to take Miss Lund home.
- Yes, sir.

1180
01:26:59,179 --> 01:27:02,307
It's nothing, just a little cut.
We had to get through a window.

1181
01:27:02,482 --> 01:27:04,245
This might come in handy.

1182
01:27:04,451 --> 01:27:05,543
Thank you.

1183
01:27:05,785 --> 01:27:08,379
- Had a close one, eh?
- Yes, rather.

1184
01:27:10,423 --> 01:27:13,153
Don't you sometimes wonder
if it's worth all this?

1185
01:27:13,326 --> 01:27:15,260
I mean, what you're fighting for.

1186
01:27:16,262 --> 01:27:18,355
We might as well question
why we breathe.

1187
01:27:18,531 --> 01:27:20,089
If we stop breathing, we'll die.

1188
01:27:20,266 --> 01:27:22,700
If we stop fighting our enemies,
the world will die.

1189
01:27:22,869 --> 01:27:25,133
What of it?
Then it'll be out of its misery.

1190
01:27:25,305 --> 01:27:27,466
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine?

1191
01:27:27,641 --> 01:27:31,805
Like a man who's trying to convince himself
of something he doesn't believe in his heart.

1192
01:27:31,978 --> 01:27:35,573
Each of us has a destiny.
For good, or for evil.

1193
01:27:36,116 --> 01:27:38,641
- I get the point.
- I wonder if you do.

1194
01:27:38,985 --> 01:27:42,079
I wonder if you know that you're trying
to escape from yourself...

1195
01:27:42,288 --> 01:27:43,846
...and that you'll never succeed.

1196
01:27:44,024 --> 01:27:46,254
You seem to know all about my destiny.

1197
01:27:48,061 --> 01:27:50,655
I know a good deal more
about you than you suspect.

1198
01:27:51,031 --> 01:27:53,226
I know that you're in love with a woman.

1199
01:27:53,433 --> 01:27:55,196
It's perhaps a strange circumstance...

1200
01:27:55,368 --> 01:27:58,269
...that we both should be in love
with the same woman.

1201
01:27:58,438 --> 01:28:00,599
The first evening I came into this café...

1202
01:28:00,774 --> 01:28:03,140
...I knew there was something
between you and Ilsa.

1203
01:28:03,943 --> 01:28:05,604
Since no one is to blame...

1204
01:28:06,046 --> 01:28:08,037
...I demand no explanation.

1205
01:28:08,214 --> 01:28:11,513
I ask only one thing.
You won't give me the letters of transit.

1206
01:28:11,685 --> 01:28:13,243
All right.

1207
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:15,354
But I want my wife to be safe.

1208
01:28:15,622 --> 01:28:17,055
I ask you as a favor...

1209
01:28:17,223 --> 01:28:20,158
...to use the letters
to take her away from Casablanca.

1210
01:28:20,326 --> 01:28:21,418
You love her that much?

1211
01:28:21,628 --> 01:28:24,392
Apparently you think of me only
as the leader of a cause.

1212
01:28:25,031 --> 01:28:27,556
Well, I am also a human being.

1213
01:28:28,401 --> 01:28:29,891
Yes, I love her that much.

1214
01:28:37,711 --> 01:28:39,008
- Monsieur Laszlo?
- Yes?

1215
01:28:39,179 --> 01:28:41,704
You'll come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1216
01:28:41,881 --> 01:28:42,870
On what charge?

1217
01:28:43,049 --> 01:28:45,244
Captain Renault will discuss that
with you later.

1218
01:28:45,418 --> 01:28:48,148
It seems that destiny has taken a hand.

1219
01:28:59,933 --> 01:29:04,097
You haven't any proof, and you know it.
This isn't Germany or occupied France.

1220
01:29:04,270 --> 01:29:08,331
All you can do is fine him and give him
30 days. You might as well let him go now.

1221
01:29:08,508 --> 01:29:11,534
I'd advise you not to be too interested
in what happens to Laszlo.

1222
01:29:11,711 --> 01:29:13,178
If you were to help him escape--

1223
01:29:13,346 --> 01:29:15,780
What makes you think
I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?

1224
01:29:15,949 --> 01:29:18,417
Because, one,
you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.

1225
01:29:18,585 --> 01:29:21,679
Two, you've got the letters of transit.
Don't bother to deny it.

1226
01:29:21,888 --> 01:29:24,948
And you might do it simply
because you don't like Strasser's looks.

1227
01:29:25,125 --> 01:29:26,990
As a matter of fact,
I don't either.

1228
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:28,559
They're all excellent reasons.

1229
01:29:28,728 --> 01:29:30,662
Don't count too much on my friendship.

1230
01:29:30,830 --> 01:29:34,288
In this matter I'm powerless.
Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.

1231
01:29:34,634 --> 01:29:39,196
You're not very subtle,
but you are effective. I get the point.

1232
01:29:39,372 --> 01:29:40,862
Yes, I have the letters.

1233
01:29:41,074 --> 01:29:42,871
But I intend using them myself.

1234
01:29:43,276 --> 01:29:46,803
I'm leaving Casablanca
on tonight's plane. The last plane.

1235
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:50,040
And I'm taking a friend with me.
One you'll appreciate.

1236
01:29:50,216 --> 01:29:52,184
- What friend?
- Ilsa Lund.

1237
01:29:52,352 --> 01:29:55,947
That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape.

1238
01:29:56,122 --> 01:29:58,147
The last man I want to see in America.

1239
01:29:58,391 --> 01:30:01,588
You didn't come here to tell me this.
You have the letters of transit.

1240
01:30:01,761 --> 01:30:04,924
You can fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please.

1241
01:30:05,098 --> 01:30:07,726
Why are you still interested
in what happens to Laszlo?

1242
01:30:07,934 --> 01:30:12,132
I'm not. But I am interested
in what happens to Ilsa and me.

1243
01:30:12,372 --> 01:30:14,340
We have a legal right to go,
that's true...

1244
01:30:14,507 --> 01:30:18,034
...but people have been held in Casablanca
in spite of their legal rights.

1245
01:30:18,211 --> 01:30:21,578
- What makes you think we want to hold you?
- Ilsa is Laszlo's wife.

1246
01:30:21,748 --> 01:30:24,444
She probably knows things
that Strasser would like to know.

1247
01:30:24,617 --> 01:30:26,141
Louis, I'll make a deal with you.

1248
01:30:26,319 --> 01:30:29,846
Instead of this petty charge against him,
you could get something big...

1249
01:30:30,023 --> 01:30:33,288
...something that would chuck him
in a concentration camp for years...

1250
01:30:33,459 --> 01:30:36,053
- Be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
- Certainly.

1251
01:30:36,229 --> 01:30:38,390
Germany--
Vichy would be very grateful.

1252
01:30:38,598 --> 01:30:39,622
Then release him.

1253
01:30:39,799 --> 01:30:42,427
You be at my place a half-hour
before the plane leaves.

1254
01:30:42,602 --> 01:30:45,127
I'll have Laszlo come there
to pick up the letters...

1255
01:30:45,338 --> 01:30:47,932
...and that'll give you grounds
to make the arrest.

1256
01:30:48,208 --> 01:30:50,506
You get him, and we get away.

1257
01:30:50,677 --> 01:30:53,578
To the Germans,
that last will be just a minor annoyance.

1258
01:30:53,780 --> 01:30:56,578
There's still something about this
I don't quite understand.

1259
01:30:56,783 --> 01:30:59,479
Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes...

1260
01:30:59,652 --> 01:31:01,984
...but you were never interested
in any woman.

1261
01:31:02,155 --> 01:31:04,783
- She isn't just any woman.
- I see.

1262
01:31:05,391 --> 01:31:07,791
How do I know you'll keep
your end of the bargain?

1263
01:31:07,961 --> 01:31:10,828
I'll make the arrangements now
with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

1264
01:31:10,997 --> 01:31:15,457
I'm gonna miss you. You're the only one
in Casablanca who has less scruples than I.

1265
01:31:15,735 --> 01:31:16,997
Oh, thanks.

1266
01:31:17,637 --> 01:31:18,729
Go ahead, Ricky.

1267
01:31:18,938 --> 01:31:23,307
Call off your watchdogs when you let him go.
I don't want them around this afternoon.

1268
01:31:23,476 --> 01:31:25,808
I'm taking no chances, Louis,
not even with you.

1269
01:31:33,419 --> 01:31:35,979
Should we draw up papers,
or is a handshake good enough?

1270
01:31:36,155 --> 01:31:39,420
Certainly not good enough.
But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.

1271
01:31:39,726 --> 01:31:43,059
To get out of Casablanca and
go to America... You're a lucky man.

1272
01:31:43,263 --> 01:31:48,667
My agreement with Sam is that he gets
25 percent of the profits. That still goes.

1273
01:31:48,835 --> 01:31:51,633
I happen to know he gets 10 percent.
But he's worth 25.

1274
01:31:51,804 --> 01:31:54,773
Abdul, Carl and Sascha,
they stay with the place or I don't sell.

1275
01:31:54,974 --> 01:31:57,408
Of course.
Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.

1276
01:31:57,577 --> 01:31:58,908
Well, so long.

1277
01:31:59,078 --> 01:32:02,104
Don't forget you owe Rick's
100 cartons of American cigarettes.

1278
01:32:02,282 --> 01:32:04,773
I shall remember to pay it to myself.

1279
01:32:39,752 --> 01:32:42,482
- You're late.
- I was informed when Laszlo left the hotel...

1280
01:32:42,655 --> 01:32:43,952
...so I knew I'd be on time.

1281
01:32:44,123 --> 01:32:47,149
- I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
- He won't be followed here.

1282
01:32:47,327 --> 01:32:49,420
This place will never be
the same without you.

1283
01:32:49,629 --> 01:32:53,156
I know what you mean. But I've spoken
to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.

1284
01:32:53,333 --> 01:32:56,063
- Is everything ready?
- I have the letters right here.

1285
01:32:56,235 --> 01:32:58,430
When we searched the place,
where were they?

1286
01:32:58,604 --> 01:32:59,764
Sam's piano.

1287
01:33:00,506 --> 01:33:02,440
Serves me right for not being musical.

1288
01:33:02,709 --> 01:33:03,733
Here they are.

1289
01:33:04,243 --> 01:33:05,972
You better wait in my office.

1290
01:33:15,688 --> 01:33:18,282
Victor thinks I'm leaving with him.
Haven't you told him?

1291
01:33:18,458 --> 01:33:20,892
- Not yet.
- But you were able to arrange everything?

1292
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:22,425
Everything is quite all right.

1293
01:33:22,595 --> 01:33:25,621
We'll tell him at the airport.
The less time to think, the easier.

1294
01:33:25,798 --> 01:33:27,629
Please trust me.

1295
01:33:29,669 --> 01:33:30,897
Yes, I will.

1296
01:33:36,109 --> 01:33:40,205
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Save it. We've still lots of things to do.

1297
01:33:42,015 --> 01:33:45,109
- I brought the money.
- Keep it, you'll need it in America.

1298
01:33:45,518 --> 01:33:47,418
- But we made a deal.
- Never mind that.

1299
01:33:47,587 --> 01:33:50,886
- You won't have any trouble in Lisbon?
- No. It's all arranged.

1300
01:33:51,057 --> 01:33:53,389
Good. I've got the letters here,
made out in blank.

1301
01:33:53,559 --> 01:33:55,993
All you have to do is fill
in the signatures.

1302
01:33:56,162 --> 01:33:57,561
Victor Laszlo.

1303
01:33:58,097 --> 01:34:00,827
Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.

1304
01:34:03,436 --> 01:34:07,429
The charge of accessory to the murder of the
couriers from whom the letters were stolen.

1305
01:34:08,041 --> 01:34:11,272
You're surprised about my friend Ricky?
The explanation is simple.

1306
01:34:11,477 --> 01:34:14,446
Love, it seems,
has triumphed over virtue. Thank--

1307
01:34:15,248 --> 01:34:19,685
Not so fast, Louis. Nobody is going
to be arrested. Not for a while yet.

1308
01:34:19,852 --> 01:34:21,843
- Have you lost your mind?
- I have. Sit down.

1309
01:34:22,021 --> 01:34:24,148
- Put that gun down.
- I don't want to shoot you...

1310
01:34:24,323 --> 01:34:26,188
...but I will if you take one more step.

1311
01:34:26,893 --> 01:34:29,123
Under the circumstances,
I will sit down.

1312
01:34:32,365 --> 01:34:35,857
- Keep your hands on the table.
- I wonder if you realize what this means.

1313
01:34:36,035 --> 01:34:38,162
I do. We've got time to discuss that later.

1314
01:34:38,337 --> 01:34:39,929
Call off your watchdogs, you said.

1315
01:34:40,106 --> 01:34:42,734
Just the same, call the airport
and let me hear you tell them.

1316
01:34:42,909 --> 01:34:45,309
And remember,
this gun is pointed right at your heart.

1317
01:34:45,478 --> 01:34:47,571
That is my least vulnerable spot.

1318
01:34:55,121 --> 01:34:57,180
Hello? Is that the airport?

1319
01:34:58,491 --> 01:35:00,152
This is Captain Renault speaking.

1320
01:35:00,359 --> 01:35:02,919
There'll be two letters of transit
for the Lisbon plane.

1321
01:35:03,096 --> 01:35:04,893
There's to be no trouble about them.

1322
01:35:05,331 --> 01:35:06,320
Good.

1323
01:35:06,766 --> 01:35:07,926
Hello?

1324
01:35:13,039 --> 01:35:14,438
My car, quickly!

1325
01:35:16,109 --> 01:35:17,201
This is Major Strasser.

1326
01:35:17,376 --> 01:35:19,844
Have a squad of police meet me
at the airport at once.

1327
01:35:20,012 --> 01:35:21,309
At once, do you hear?

1328
01:35:28,454 --> 01:35:30,479
Hello, radio tower?

1329
01:35:30,656 --> 01:35:33,750
Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes,
east runway.

1330
01:35:34,026 --> 01:35:36,494
Visibility, 1 1/2 miles.

1331
01:35:36,662 --> 01:35:40,598
Light ground fog.
Depth of fog approximately 500.

1332
01:35:40,766 --> 01:35:43,496
Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.

1333
01:35:56,015 --> 01:35:58,745
Have your man go with Laszlo
and take care of his luggage.

1334
01:35:58,918 --> 01:36:00,681
Certainly, Rick, anything you say.

1335
01:36:00,887 --> 01:36:04,288
- Find Laszlo's luggage. Put it on the plane.
- Yes, sir.

1336
01:36:04,457 --> 01:36:05,446
This way, please.

1337
01:36:07,326 --> 01:36:10,454
If you don't mind, fill in the names.
That'll make it more official.

1338
01:36:10,630 --> 01:36:12,655
You think of everything, don't you?

1339
01:36:12,832 --> 01:36:15,266
And the names are
Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

1340
01:36:15,468 --> 01:36:19,029
- But why my name, Richard?
- Because you're getting on that plane.

1341
01:36:19,205 --> 01:36:20,797
I don't understand.
What about you?

1342
01:36:20,973 --> 01:36:23,066
I'm staying with him
till the plane gets away.

1343
01:36:23,242 --> 01:36:25,233
No. What has happened?
Last night you said--

1344
01:36:25,411 --> 01:36:27,208
Last night we said a great many things.

1345
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:29,280
You said I was to do the thinking for us.

1346
01:36:29,448 --> 01:36:32,110
I've done a lot of it since then.
It adds up to one thing:

1347
01:36:32,285 --> 01:36:34,947
You're getting on that plane
with Victor where you belong.

1348
01:36:35,121 --> 01:36:36,952
Now, you've got to listen to me.

1349
01:36:37,123 --> 01:36:40,024
Any idea what you'd have
to look forward to if you stayed here?

1350
01:36:40,193 --> 01:36:43,492
Chances are we'd both wind up
in a concentration camp. True, Louis?

1351
01:36:43,663 --> 01:36:45,927
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

1352
01:36:46,098 --> 01:36:49,534
- You're saying this only to make me go.
- I'm saying it because it's true.

1353
01:36:49,735 --> 01:36:51,965
Inside of us we both know
you belong with Victor.

1354
01:36:52,138 --> 01:36:54,504
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

1355
01:36:54,674 --> 01:36:57,541
If that plane leaves
and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

1356
01:36:57,743 --> 01:37:01,235
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

1357
01:37:02,114 --> 01:37:04,207
But what about us?

1358
01:37:04,383 --> 01:37:05,782
We'll always have Paris.

1359
01:37:05,952 --> 01:37:08,944
We didn't have-- We'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.

1360
01:37:09,355 --> 01:37:11,016
We got it back last night.

1361
01:37:11,924 --> 01:37:15,690
- When I said I would never leave you.
- And you never will.

1362
01:37:16,195 --> 01:37:17,685
But I've got a job to do too.

1363
01:37:17,897 --> 01:37:21,628
Where I'm going, you can't follow.
What I've got to do you can't be any part of.

1364
01:37:22,235 --> 01:37:23,759
Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble.

1365
01:37:23,936 --> 01:37:27,394
But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of three little people...

1366
01:37:27,573 --> 01:37:30,269
...don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

1367
01:37:30,443 --> 01:37:32,968
Someday you'll understand that.

1368
01:37:34,146 --> 01:37:35,909
Now, now.

1369
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:39,848
Here's looking at you, kid.

1370
01:37:55,001 --> 01:37:57,492
- Everything is in order.
- All except one thing.

1371
01:37:57,737 --> 01:37:59,864
There's something you should know.

1372
01:38:00,106 --> 01:38:01,903
I don't ask you to explain anything.

1373
01:38:02,074 --> 01:38:05,168
I'm going to anyway.
It may make a difference to you later on.

1374
01:38:05,344 --> 01:38:07,209
You said you knew about Ilsa and me.

1375
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:10,247
You didn't know she was at my place
last night when you were.

1376
01:38:10,416 --> 01:38:13,852
She came there for the letters of transit.
Isn't that true, Ilsa?

1377
01:38:14,287 --> 01:38:15,515
Yes.

1378
01:38:15,688 --> 01:38:17,713
She tried everything to get them.
Nothing worked.

1379
01:38:17,890 --> 01:38:21,417
She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.

1380
01:38:21,594 --> 01:38:24,119
But that was all over long ago.

1381
01:38:24,297 --> 01:38:27,562
For your sake, she pretended it wasn't,
and I let her pretend.

1382
01:38:28,067 --> 01:38:29,694
I understand.

1383
01:38:29,869 --> 01:38:32,064
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

1384
01:38:32,772 --> 01:38:34,569
I appreciate it.

1385
01:38:35,441 --> 01:38:37,204
Welcome back to the fight.

1386
01:38:37,410 --> 01:38:39,935
This time I know our side will win.

1387
01:38:53,659 --> 01:38:55,820
Are you ready, Ilsa?

1388
01:38:57,697 --> 01:38:59,062
Yes, I'm ready.

1389
01:39:02,201 --> 01:39:03,566
Goodbye, Rick.

1390
01:39:04,437 --> 01:39:06,337
God bless you.

1391
01:39:07,673 --> 01:39:10,369
You better hurry.
You'll miss that plane.

1392
01:39:28,427 --> 01:39:30,361
I was right.
You are a sentimentalist.

1393
01:39:30,529 --> 01:39:33,362
Stay where you are.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1394
01:39:33,532 --> 01:39:34,863
What you just did for Laszlo.

1395
01:39:35,034 --> 01:39:37,434
That fairy tale you invented
to send Ilsa away with him.

1396
01:39:37,603 --> 01:39:39,935
I know a little about women, my friend.
She went.

1397
01:39:40,139 --> 01:39:42,164
But she knew you were lying.

1398
01:39:42,341 --> 01:39:44,275
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

1399
01:39:44,443 --> 01:39:48,743
I suppose you know this isn't going to be
pleasant for either of us. Especially for you.

1400
01:39:48,914 --> 01:39:52,406
- I'll have to arrest you, of course.
- As soon as the plane goes, Louis.

1401
01:39:59,458 --> 01:40:03,792
- What was the meaning of that phone call?
- Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

1402
01:40:06,365 --> 01:40:08,458
Why do you stand here?
Why don't you stop him?

1403
01:40:08,634 --> 01:40:10,659
Ask Monsieur Rick.

1404
01:40:12,972 --> 01:40:15,805
- Get away from that phone.
- I advise you not to interfere.

1405
01:40:16,008 --> 01:40:19,273
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault,
and I'm willing to shoot you.

1406
01:40:21,247 --> 01:40:22,805
- Hello!
- Put that phone down.

1407
01:40:22,982 --> 01:40:24,847
- Get me the radio tower.
- Put it down!

1408
01:40:39,899 --> 01:40:41,457
Major Strasser has been shot.

1409
01:40:46,238 --> 01:40:48,866
Round up the usual suspects.

1410
01:41:12,598 --> 01:41:16,261
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist,
but you've become a patriot.

1411
01:41:16,435 --> 01:41:18,596
Maybe, but it seemed
like a good time to start.

1412
01:41:18,771 --> 01:41:21,001
I think perhaps you're right.

1413
01:41:45,798 --> 01:41:49,495
It might be a good idea for you
to disappear from Casablanca for a while.

1414
01:41:49,668 --> 01:41:52,102
There's a Free French garrison
over at Brazzaville.

1415
01:41:52,271 --> 01:41:56,071
- I could be induced to arrange a passage.
- My letter of transit?

1416
01:41:56,308 --> 01:41:57,536
I could use a trip.

1417
01:41:57,743 --> 01:42:01,008
But it doesn't change our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 francs.

1418
01:42:01,247 --> 01:42:04,148
That 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

1419
01:42:04,316 --> 01:42:05,544
"Our" expenses?

1420
01:42:06,385 --> 01:42:10,583
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
