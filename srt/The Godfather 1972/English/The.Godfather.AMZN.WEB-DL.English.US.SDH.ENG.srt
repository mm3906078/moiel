We'’ll discuss it when you

Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International'’s most valuable proteges.

389
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:23,969
For five years,
we had her under training.

390
00:31:24,012 --> 00:31:27,015
Singing lessons, acting
lessons, dancing lessons.

391
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:29,496
I spent hundreds of thousands
of dollars on her,

392
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:31,672
I was gonna make
her a big star.

393
00:31:31,715 --> 00:31:34,588
And let me be
even more frank.

394
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:36,938
Just to show you that
I'’m not a hardhearted man.

395
00:31:36,982 --> 00:31:39,636
That it'’s not all
dollars and cents.

396
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,336
She was beautiful.
She was young, she was innocent!

397
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:45,642
She'’s the greatest
piece of ass I'’ve had

00:31:45,686 --> 00:31:48,863

all over the world.

399
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:54,956
And then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

400
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,046
And she runs off.

401
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:02,311
She threw it all away just
to make me look ridiculous!

402
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:07,534
And a man in my position can'’t
afford to be made to look ridiculous!

Sollozzo is known
as The Turk.

417
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:38,902
He'’s supposed to be
very good with a knife,

but only in matters of business with
some sort of reasonable complaint.

Uh, his business is narcotics.

420
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,175
He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.

421
00:34:50,218 --> 00:34:54,092
In Sicily he has plants
to process them into heroin.

TOM: Well I say, Yes.

There'’s more money potential in narcotics than anything else we'’re looking at.

Maybe the five families,
maybe all of them

Now with the money they earn,

00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:37,831
they can buy more Police

439

Then they come after us.

440

we have the gambling,

30%.

454
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:28,490
In the first year your end should
be three, four million dollars.

455
00:36:29,796 --> 00:36:32,973
And then it would go up.

That'’s right.

Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

463

to be treated
with respect.

But, I must say no to you.

selfish reasons.

or if he'’s struck

Don'’t insist.
