1
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,561
Hey!

2
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,063
If you want any tickets,

3
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:50,776
you'll have to go around to the front of...

4
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,612
Well, I suppose it'll be all right.

5
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,823
What the hell am I doing around here?

6
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,199
They walk in here and...

7
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,749
Let's see. I hope I got...

8
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:07,918
Three?

9
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,227
That'll be $7...

10
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,484
...and 50 cents.

11
00:06:49,909 --> 00:10:55,779
No.

12
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,712
Frank?

13
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,508
Frank sent us.

14
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,055
Did you bring a horse for me?

15
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,605
Well, looks like we're...

16
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,276
Looks like we're shy one horse.

17
00:13:03,450 --> 00:14:26,615
You brought two too many.

18
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,946
Hey, Pa!

19
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,406
Look!

20
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:16,350
That's enough for now.
It's getting late. Come on home.

21
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,407
Timmy.

22
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,002
Maureen, look.

23
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:08,462
What you doing there?
Go inside, quick, and get washed.

24
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,215
And don't touch the apple pie
or the roast.

25
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,843
Patrick's already left
for the station, huh?

26
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,804
He's getting ready, Pa.

27
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:19,139
- Damn it, Patrick!
- Coming, Pa.

28
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,853
Not bad, I'd say.

29
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,483
Bigger, them slices. What the hell?
We're throwing a party, ain't we?

30
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:33,362
But these are the same slices as usual.

31
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,243
Yeah, sure.

32
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,788
As usual.

33
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,875
Maureen.

34
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:54,550
Soon, you can cut the bread in slices
as big as a door if you want to.

35
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,469
You'll have beautiful new clothes

36
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,346
and you won't have to work no more.

37
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:03,392
We're going to get rich, Pa?

38
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,898
Who knows?

39
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,234
Patrick!

40
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:14,903
Wait a minute!

41
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,074
Look at the filth on your boots.
Clean them.

42
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,123
The train will come in

43
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,042
and there won't be no one
to meet your mother.

44
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,587
Our mother died six years ago.

45
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,351
Go now, or you'll really be late.

46
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:52,691
Just a minute. Listen, Pa.
How am I gonna recognize her?

47
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,902
You can't make no mistake, Patrick.

48
00:19:54,986 --> 00:20:00,657
She's young and she's pretty
and she's a lady.

49
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:06,955
"For traveling,
I'll be wearing a black dress

50
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:14,171
"and the same straw hat
that I was wearing when we met."

51
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,435
I'm gonna get some fresh water
from the well.

52
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,482
Oh, Danny boy

53
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:37,736
The pipes, the pipes are calling

54
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:44,076
And down the mountain side

55
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,953
The summer's gone

56
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:50,374
And all the roses fall...

57
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:48,098
Maureen!

58
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:58,354
What are we gonna do
with this one, Frank?

59
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,913
Now that you've called me by name...

60
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:59,141
I saw some mighty fine stock
down south.

61
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,809
Is that so?

62
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,354
And the prices are good.

63
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:16,158
- These your valises, ma'am?
- Yes.

64
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,410
- Come, Sarah.
- Bring them other two.

65
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:20,788
We'll tote them for you, ma'am.

66
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,728
Is that true? The sawmill needs hands?

67
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:47,648
- Was yesterday.
- Why didn't you tell your brother?

68
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:50,442
- Hiya, Gramps.
- Hiya, Bill. We're back again.

69
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:52,903
Come on. Get a move on, will you?

70
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:58,075
Get the lead out of your asses,
you redskin warriors.

71
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,369
I got a whole train to unload.

72
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:03,622
All right,
chuck down those feed sacks first.

73
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:06,166
Come on! Come on!

74
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:56,420
What's the name of the place
you wanted to go?

75
00:29:57,088 --> 00:29:58,464
Sweetwater.

76
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:02,718
Brett McBain's farm.

77
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:07,264
McBain? Yeah, sure.

78
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:09,767
That stubborn redheaded Irishman,

79
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:13,729
tilling sand for years way out there
in the middle of nowhere.

80
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:15,606
Sweetwater!

81
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,649
Only a loony like him could call

82
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:20,819
that stinking piece of desert
Sweetwater.

83
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:23,238
Sweetwater!

84
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:28,994
That's good! Sweetwater!

85
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:15,666
That's right. A little more to the right.

86
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,543
Higher. Higher.

87
00:31:19,504 --> 00:31:21,005
Hold it there.

88
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,392
Here they are.
Even got here with their damn rails.

89
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:36,895
They caught up with us again,
eh, Lafayette? Let's go!

90
00:31:37,647 --> 00:31:39,773
Hey, slow down.
What's the matter with you? Slow down!

91
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:41,817
Hey, boys! Watch out!

92
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,112
Watch out down there!

93
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:46,238
Slow down!

94
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:55,349
Why are we stopping?
I told you I was in a hurry.

95
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:57,726
Don't the train stop?

96
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:47,336
What can I do for you, ma'am?

97
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:50,172
I would like some water,
if it's no trouble.

98
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:51,423
Water?

99
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:54,843
Well, you see, that word
is poison around these parts

100
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:57,221
ever since the days of the great flood.

101
00:34:57,305 --> 00:35:00,724
- You mean you never wash?
- We sure do!

102
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:03,519
I'd like to use the same facilities
you people do.

103
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:05,145
You sure can.

104
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,272
Just happen to have
a full tub in the back.

105
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:08,649
And you're lucky.

106
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:10,651
Only three people
have used it this morning.

107
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:14,238
Used it one at a time or all together?

108
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:22,246
I can tell you're accustomed
to fine living.

109
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:25,499
Bet you come from
one of those big eastern cities.

110
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:27,960
- New Orleans.
- New Orleans!

111
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:30,212
- You've been there?
- No.

112
00:35:30,588 --> 00:35:32,923
But I got a cousin down there.
She runs a bar.

113
00:35:33,008 --> 00:35:35,259
You know, she...

114
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:17,486
Jug.

115
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:27,616
Do you only know how to play
or do you know how to shoot?

116
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:34,748
Do you know how to blow music
from that?

117
00:39:54,936 --> 00:39:56,812
Pick it up.

118
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:23,797
You!

119
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:33,515
You don't know how to play.

120
00:40:57,832 --> 00:40:59,458
Try this one.

121
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:16,058
Take it.

122
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:36,745
Go on.

123
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:49,425
Here.

124
00:42:30,508 --> 00:42:31,842
Bravo.

125
00:42:55,992 --> 00:42:57,284
Cheyenne.

126
00:42:57,827 --> 00:42:59,578
We thought we'd never make it.

127
00:42:59,662 --> 00:43:02,498
It's all right. You're right on time.

128
00:43:05,293 --> 00:43:07,294
To bury my escort.

129
00:43:08,004 --> 00:43:11,590
If I'd waited for you, I'd be in jail by now.

130
00:43:28,525 --> 00:43:29,775
Hey.

131
00:43:38,576 --> 00:43:40,160
The gun.

132
00:44:01,683 --> 00:44:05,269
You interested in fashions, Harmonica?

133
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:14,820
I saw three of these dusters
a short time ago.

134
00:44:14,904 --> 00:44:15,904
They were waiting for a train.

135
00:44:22,328 --> 00:44:25,581
Inside the dusters,
there were three men.

136
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:28,709
So?

137
00:44:30,587 --> 00:44:33,797
Inside the men, there were three bullets.

138
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,395
That's a crazy story, Harmonica.

139
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,066
For two reasons.

140
00:44:52,692 --> 00:44:55,944
One, nobody around
these parts got the guts

141
00:44:56,029 --> 00:44:58,947
to wear those dusters
except Cheyenne's men.

142
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:03,660
Two, Cheyenne's men don't get killed.

143
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:09,458
That surprise you?

144
00:45:10,418 --> 00:45:11,502
Yeah.

145
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:17,966
Well, you know music.

146
00:45:18,677 --> 00:45:21,887
And you can count.
All the way up to two.

147
00:45:30,188 --> 00:45:32,898
All the way up to six, if I have to.

148
00:45:34,484 --> 00:45:35,984
And maybe faster than you.

149
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:51,959
Yeah, go on.

150
00:45:52,752 --> 00:45:54,294
Play, Harmonica.

151
00:45:54,921 --> 00:45:57,047
Play, so you can't bullshit.

152
00:45:58,758 --> 00:46:01,176
Only, watch those false notes.

153
00:46:10,395 --> 00:46:11,645
Like so?

154
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:27,953
And so, this cousin of mine

155
00:46:28,038 --> 00:46:29,872
keeps writing me
to come on down to New Orleans.

156
00:46:29,956 --> 00:46:33,667
"Come on down. Help me with the bar.
Make a pile of money."

157
00:46:34,502 --> 00:46:36,920
I don't think I'd get along in a big city.

158
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:39,465
It's too full of fast men
and loose women.

159
00:46:39,549 --> 00:46:42,051
Begging your pardon, ma'am. No.

160
00:46:42,886 --> 00:46:47,389
Now, I'm too used to
a quiet, simple country life.

161
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:19,792
He's Timmy.

162
00:49:20,543 --> 00:49:21,960
Yes.

163
00:49:22,962 --> 00:49:24,755
Dear God.

164
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:28,217
On the day...

165
00:49:29,511 --> 00:49:32,680
On the very day of your wedding.

166
00:49:33,556 --> 00:49:34,848
Poor little miss.

167
00:49:36,893 --> 00:49:38,352
Mrs...

168
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,855
Mrs. McBain.

169
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,775
But we all... But we thought...

170
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,361
I know.

171
00:49:47,445 --> 00:49:49,697
It was to be a surprise today.

172
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:53,867
Brett McBain and I were married.

173
00:49:54,244 --> 00:49:55,994
A month ago.

174
00:49:56,538 --> 00:49:58,747
In New Orleans.

175
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:17,641
"I am the resurrection, and the life.

176
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:21,353
"He that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

177
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:24,898
"Whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die."

178
00:50:24,983 --> 00:50:26,108
Amen.

179
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:44,793
- Mr. Bennett!
- What's he doing here?

180
00:50:48,089 --> 00:50:50,883
I found this collar on a nail by the door.

181
00:50:54,804 --> 00:50:58,640
You got no way of knowing,
but this is as good as a signature.

182
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:00,809
Cheyenne's hand.

183
00:51:02,354 --> 00:51:06,190
- But why?
- Don't worry, Mrs. McBain.

184
00:51:06,274 --> 00:51:08,817
We'll make them tell us
before we hang them.

185
00:51:10,278 --> 00:51:12,237
Let's get moving.

186
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:32,758
Come on.

187
00:51:33,343 --> 00:51:35,636
Let's go back to Flagstone.

188
00:51:38,682 --> 00:51:40,432
No, Sam.

189
00:51:42,018 --> 00:51:43,435
You go back.

190
00:51:44,854 --> 00:51:47,439
You don't want to stay out here alone.

191
00:51:49,192 --> 00:51:50,442
Why not?

192
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:52,486
This is my home.

193
00:55:51,518 --> 00:55:53,352
You know, Wobbles,

194
00:55:55,355 --> 00:55:56,939
I'm kind of mad at you.

195
00:56:01,236 --> 00:56:03,278
Frank wasn't there.

196
00:56:04,781 --> 00:56:06,990
He sent three friends.

197
00:56:07,075 --> 00:56:09,785
I don't know nothing, I swear.

198
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:14,498
I only arranged the meeting
the way you wanted it.

199
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:17,960
I don't know why Frank wasn't there.

200
00:56:18,128 --> 00:56:21,880
- I swear to you that l...
- 'Cause he was at the McBains'.

201
00:56:22,465 --> 00:56:25,217
That's not true. Cheyenne did that job.

202
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:28,095
Everyone knows that. We got proof.

203
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:30,556
That was always one of Frank's tricks.

204
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,433
Faking evidence.

205
00:56:34,394 --> 00:56:35,853
I don't know.

206
00:56:36,312 --> 00:56:37,479
I swear.

207
00:56:37,564 --> 00:56:41,942
I only arranged the meeting. I swear.

208
00:56:42,027 --> 00:56:44,486
I don't know nothing.

209
00:58:45,108 --> 00:58:46,525
Who's there?

210
01:01:18,928 --> 01:01:20,721
Did you make coffee?

211
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,101
Make it.

212
01:01:34,027 --> 01:01:35,778
Didn't sleep a wink.

213
01:01:36,571 --> 01:01:40,991
A pack of turds dressed in black
rode herd on me the whole damn night.

214
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:46,830
Yeah, but I left them
in the middle of the desert.

215
01:01:46,915 --> 01:01:49,124
If they're lucky,
they'll be home in three days.

216
01:02:08,603 --> 01:02:11,980
I'll do it. You fetch the coffee.

217
01:02:18,321 --> 01:02:22,157
They want to hang me,
the big black crows.

218
01:02:24,202 --> 01:02:25,744
Idiots.

219
01:02:26,162 --> 01:02:27,996
What the hell?

220
01:02:28,206 --> 01:02:31,250
I'll kill anything, but never a kid.

221
01:02:32,043 --> 01:02:34,044
Be like killing a priest.

222
01:02:34,629 --> 01:02:37,047
A Catholic priest, that is.

223
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:41,093
Yeah, the world is full of people
who hate Cheyenne.

224
01:02:56,651 --> 01:03:00,821
See, I ain't the mean bastard
people make out.

225
01:03:03,908 --> 01:03:09,204
Of course, if somebody
had a mind to kill me,

226
01:03:11,499 --> 01:03:13,042
it fires me up.

227
01:03:15,086 --> 01:03:17,671
And a fired-up Cheyenne

228
01:03:19,841 --> 01:03:21,884
ain't a nice thing to see.

229
01:03:22,510 --> 01:03:24,720
Especially for a lady.

230
01:03:37,609 --> 01:03:40,569
But you're too smart to make him mad.

231
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:50,245
So this here's where I was
supposed to do all the killing?

232
01:03:50,955 --> 01:03:52,247
Yeah.

233
01:03:54,334 --> 01:03:57,252
Don't seem the place is worth a shit.

234
01:04:03,093 --> 01:04:07,763
Now, if somebody gets dressed up
to look like me,

235
01:04:11,184 --> 01:04:14,186
so they can hang this thing
around my neck,

236
01:04:15,814 --> 01:04:17,606
I don't like it none.

237
01:04:18,858 --> 01:04:20,818
But I can understand it.

238
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:29,201
What I don't understand is why.

239
01:04:30,912 --> 01:04:32,705
Neither do l.

240
01:04:37,127 --> 01:04:40,796
But I see you looked a lot for the why.

241
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:48,595
Yeah.

242
01:04:52,183 --> 01:04:55,060
What if there were
a whole heap of whys?

243
01:04:56,229 --> 01:04:59,231
Round. Yellow.

244
01:05:00,483 --> 01:05:02,484
You know the kind.

245
01:05:03,486 --> 01:05:05,821
You rap them on a stone

246
01:05:06,906 --> 01:05:08,782
and they go "ding."

247
01:05:09,367 --> 01:05:10,701
Maybe.

248
01:05:13,288 --> 01:05:15,497
But I didn't find them.

249
01:05:21,379 --> 01:05:22,755
By the way,

250
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:27,134
you know anything about a man
going around playing a harmonica?

251
01:05:30,138 --> 01:05:31,972
He's somebody you'd remember.

252
01:05:34,059 --> 01:05:36,268
Instead of talking, he plays.

253
01:05:37,437 --> 01:05:40,314
And when he'd better play, he talks.

254
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:48,447
You know, ma'am, when you've
killed four, it's easy to make it five.

255
01:05:52,285 --> 01:05:55,204
Sure. You're an expert.

256
01:06:00,168 --> 01:06:03,003
Ma'am, it seems to me
you ain't caught the idea.

257
01:06:07,967 --> 01:06:10,260
Of course I have.

258
01:06:11,554 --> 01:06:14,598
I'm here alone in the hands
of a bandit who smelled money.

259
01:06:15,225 --> 01:06:18,352
If you want to, you can lay me
over the table and amuse yourself.

260
01:06:18,561 --> 01:06:20,312
And even call in your men.

261
01:06:20,397 --> 01:06:23,232
Well, no woman ever died from that.

262
01:06:23,733 --> 01:06:26,985
When you're finished, all I'll need
will be a tub of boiling water,

263
01:06:27,404 --> 01:06:29,822
and I'll be exactly what I was before.

264
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:33,742
With just another filthy memory.

265
01:06:50,135 --> 01:06:52,428
You make good coffee, at least?

266
01:06:53,304 --> 01:06:54,722
Not bad.

267
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:56,974
Congratulations.

268
01:06:57,642 --> 01:07:01,145
Tell me, was it necessary
that you kill all of them?

269
01:07:01,438 --> 01:07:03,647
I only told you to scare them.

270
01:07:04,774 --> 01:07:07,401
People scare better when they're dying.

271
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:11,572
And can you tell me what good
was your stupid massacre?

272
01:07:12,782 --> 01:07:15,159
Now, a Mrs. McBain has turned up.

273
01:07:17,829 --> 01:07:21,165
So, I didn't expect that.
It happens in business.

274
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:24,793
Let's say this is something
I didn't plan on.

275
01:07:25,378 --> 01:07:28,464
I have no time for surprises, Frank.

276
01:07:30,008 --> 01:07:31,675
You know that.

277
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:36,555
I got on board in sight of the Atlantic,

278
01:07:36,973 --> 01:07:38,891
and before my eyes rot,

279
01:07:40,393 --> 01:07:44,563
I want to see the blue of the Pacific
outside that window.

280
01:07:46,316 --> 01:07:48,108
I know where you got on board.

281
01:07:48,193 --> 01:07:50,819
I was there, too, remember?

282
01:07:55,700 --> 01:08:01,330
"To remove small obstacles
from the track," you said.

283
01:08:03,124 --> 01:08:05,000
Well, there were a few.

284
01:08:09,214 --> 01:08:12,049
But we traveled a long way,
just the same.

285
01:08:12,133 --> 01:08:13,175
And fast.

286
01:08:13,885 --> 01:08:17,805
Even tuberculosis of the bones
travels fast.

287
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:23,477
Don't play the sick man with me,
Mr. Morton.

288
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:27,022
I knew you
when you were just barely limping.

289
01:08:29,651 --> 01:08:33,862
I watch that dry rot rise
a little more every day.

290
01:08:36,199 --> 01:08:38,909
Any normal man would
put a bullet in his brain.

291
01:08:38,993 --> 01:08:43,122
But you, you just got a little more hasty.

292
01:08:43,873 --> 01:08:46,208
Otherwise you ain't changed any.

293
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:48,836
I'd say you've changed, Frank.

294
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,295
A lot.

295
01:08:51,631 --> 01:08:55,217
You used to take care
of certain things personally.

296
01:08:56,845 --> 01:08:59,596
Now, you're keeping in the background.

297
01:09:01,599 --> 01:09:04,226
You'll end up giving orders.

298
01:09:05,895 --> 01:09:09,815
It's because, now, I don't want
to leave you alone too much.

299
01:09:11,818 --> 01:09:15,279
You're gonna need somebody more
and more every day to stay near you.

300
01:09:16,197 --> 01:09:18,949
- Like a friend.
- Or like a partner.

301
01:09:29,627 --> 01:09:33,130
How does it feel
sitting behind that desk, Frank?

302
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:38,927
It's almost like holding a gun.

303
01:09:43,475 --> 01:09:46,435
Only much more powerful.

304
01:10:01,659 --> 01:10:05,537
You see, staying with you,

305
01:10:07,624 --> 01:10:10,459
I'm beginning to think big, too.

306
01:10:13,463 --> 01:10:15,547
This McBain business

307
01:10:17,384 --> 01:10:19,468
has given me ideas.

308
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:29,728
I'm sorry for you, Frank.
You're doing your best.

309
01:10:31,648 --> 01:10:34,191
You'll never succeed
in becoming like me.

310
01:10:37,153 --> 01:10:38,237
Why?

311
01:10:38,321 --> 01:10:43,992
Because there are many things
you'll never understand.

312
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:56,672
This is one of them.

313
01:10:57,632 --> 01:11:01,385
You see, Frank,
there are many kinds of weapons.

314
01:11:02,012 --> 01:11:06,306
And the only one
that can stop that is this.

315
01:12:00,737 --> 01:12:03,655
Now, shall we get back
to our little problem?

316
01:12:06,242 --> 01:12:09,661
My weapons might look simple to you,
Mr. Morton,

317
01:12:10,914 --> 01:12:14,958
but they can still shoot holes
big enough for our little problems.

318
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:19,254
Pretty soon the widow McBain
won't be a problem no more.

319
01:12:20,924 --> 01:12:24,927
You wake up one morning and say,
"World, I know you.

320
01:12:25,303 --> 01:12:27,805
"From now on,
there are no more surprises."

321
01:12:27,889 --> 01:12:30,683
And then you happen
to meet a man like this,

322
01:12:30,767 --> 01:12:32,351
who looked like a good man.

323
01:12:32,686 --> 01:12:34,937
Clear eyes, strong hands.

324
01:12:35,313 --> 01:12:37,356
And he wants to marry you.

325
01:12:37,816 --> 01:12:39,608
Which doesn't happen often.

326
01:12:39,943 --> 01:12:43,028
And he says he's rich, too,
which doesn't hurt.

327
01:12:45,865 --> 01:12:49,159
So you think,
"The hell with New Orleans.

328
01:12:50,203 --> 01:12:52,579
"Now I'll say yes
and go live in the country.

329
01:12:54,290 --> 01:12:58,168
"I wouldn't mind giving him
half a dozen kids after all.

330
01:12:59,004 --> 01:13:03,799
"Take care of a house.
Do something. What the hell?"

331
01:13:15,186 --> 01:13:17,688
Well, God rest your soul, Brett McBain.

332
01:13:18,314 --> 01:13:22,568
Even if he's going to have a job
pulling you out of the devil's grip.

333
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:41,045
Still, I swear
he'd left money around someplace.

334
01:13:43,298 --> 01:13:45,591
If you can find it, you're welcome to it.

335
01:13:46,051 --> 01:13:48,469
Mrs. McBain goes back to civilization.

336
01:13:48,762 --> 01:13:51,972
Minus a husband
and plus a great future.

337
01:14:05,195 --> 01:14:06,945
You deserve better.

338
01:14:09,449 --> 01:14:13,327
The last man who told me that
is buried out there.

339
01:14:23,004 --> 01:14:25,506
You know, Jill,
you remind me of my mother.

340
01:14:29,344 --> 01:14:31,845
She was the biggest whore in Alameda

341
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:34,556
and the finest woman that ever lived.

342
01:14:36,184 --> 01:14:39,728
Whoever my father was,
for an hour or for a month,

343
01:14:41,064 --> 01:14:43,273
he must have been a happy man.

344
01:14:54,202 --> 01:14:56,453
Hey! Hey!

345
01:14:57,914 --> 01:14:59,081
Hey!

346
01:16:04,814 --> 01:16:06,482
What do you want?

347
01:16:07,942 --> 01:16:09,026
Cheyenne's right.

348
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:13,238
Once you've killed four,
it's easy to make it five.

349
01:16:27,504 --> 01:16:29,713
This isn't the time to leave.

350
01:17:32,068 --> 01:17:33,819
Give me some water.

351
01:17:43,413 --> 01:17:44,913
From the well.

352
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:48,709
I like my water fresh.

353
01:19:16,172 --> 01:19:18,298
When you hear a strange sound,
drop to the ground.

354
01:19:19,384 --> 01:19:22,011
A sound? Like what?

355
01:19:22,929 --> 01:19:24,263
Like that.

356
01:19:56,254 --> 01:20:00,382
He not only plays, he can shoot, too.

357
01:20:34,292 --> 01:20:35,751
Morning, Mrs. McBain.

358
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:38,754
- What brings you to town?
- Good morning.

359
01:20:39,005 --> 01:20:41,882
Maybe you don't remember,
but yesterday at the funeral...

360
01:20:41,966 --> 01:20:43,926
I remember very well.

361
01:20:44,302 --> 01:20:47,179
Is there something I can do for you?

362
01:20:48,348 --> 01:20:49,765
Yes.

363
01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:55,437
See Frank.
And tell him I know everything.

364
01:20:55,522 --> 01:20:58,524
Why is everybody hounding me
about this guy Frank?

365
01:20:58,608 --> 01:21:01,235
I don't know him.
I've never heard of him.

366
01:21:01,611 --> 01:21:05,364
I got my own worries,
and all I want is to be left in peace.

367
01:21:05,490 --> 01:21:08,992
Tell Frank I want to negotiate with him.
Personally.

368
01:22:03,757 --> 01:22:07,092
You were told
not to come here for any reason.

369
01:22:07,677 --> 01:22:11,221
Whatever business you have with Frank,
keep it far away from here.

370
01:22:11,306 --> 01:22:12,765
Yes, I know, Mr. Morton,

371
01:22:12,849 --> 01:22:14,683
but when I heard that woman say
she knew everything,

372
01:22:14,768 --> 01:22:17,144
I thought that the important thing
was for me to come over here

373
01:22:17,228 --> 01:22:18,437
right away and tell you about it.

374
01:22:18,855 --> 01:22:20,564
You never thought it wasn't a trick?

375
01:22:20,982 --> 01:22:22,858
Sure, but you know
that I'm mighty careful, Frank.

376
01:22:23,693 --> 01:22:25,277
No one could have followed me.

377
01:22:25,987 --> 01:22:28,238
That's the first thing I learned,
working for you.

378
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:30,949
To listen unseen and to watch unheard.

379
01:22:32,118 --> 01:22:35,120
You should learn to live
as if you didn't exist.

380
01:22:35,830 --> 01:22:37,748
You've known me a long time, Frank.

381
01:22:37,832 --> 01:22:39,667
You know you can trust me.

382
01:22:39,751 --> 01:22:41,502
Wobbles.

383
01:22:46,091 --> 01:22:49,885
How can you trust a man who wears
both a belt and suspenders?

384
01:22:50,762 --> 01:22:53,806
The man can't even trust his own pants.

385
01:23:03,483 --> 01:23:05,067
Let's get out of here.

386
01:24:44,834 --> 01:24:46,585
The end of the line.

387
01:24:49,506 --> 01:24:50,589
Yeah.

388
01:24:56,596 --> 01:24:58,055
Get him on board.

389
01:25:12,445 --> 01:25:14,321
Tie him up.

390
01:25:48,314 --> 01:25:49,356
Wait, Frank.

391
01:25:50,233 --> 01:25:51,650
I didn't...

392
01:25:51,735 --> 01:25:53,527
So, nobody followed you?

393
01:25:54,112 --> 01:25:56,447
No. You gotta believe me.

394
01:25:57,615 --> 01:25:59,950
So, this is the way I can trust you.

395
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,953
I can explain. I didn't know that he...

396
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,540
- Get out.
- No. No. No, Frank.

397
01:26:07,292 --> 01:26:08,876
Get out.

398
01:26:27,771 --> 01:26:29,980
Frank, wait!

399
01:26:51,795 --> 01:26:54,296
I told you to keep quiet.

400
01:26:59,010 --> 01:27:01,470
Where are Logan and Jim?
They take care of the woman?

401
01:27:01,805 --> 01:27:03,514
Someone took care of them.

402
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:06,225
We found them out at McBain's place.

403
01:27:06,601 --> 01:27:09,019
Stone dead. And the woman was gone.

404
01:27:10,063 --> 01:27:13,148
Your friends
have a high mortality rate, Frank.

405
01:27:24,703 --> 01:27:27,246
First three, then two.

406
01:27:39,592 --> 01:27:42,136
So you're the one
who makes appointments.

407
01:27:43,888 --> 01:27:46,974
And you're the one
who doesn't keep them.

408
01:27:48,685 --> 01:27:50,352
What do you want?

409
01:27:51,563 --> 01:27:52,980
Who are you?

410
01:27:56,443 --> 01:27:57,901
Dave Jenkins.

411
01:28:06,036 --> 01:28:08,662
Dave Jenkins is dead a long time ago.

412
01:28:09,873 --> 01:28:11,707
Calder Benson.

413
01:28:13,501 --> 01:28:16,045
What's your name? Benson's dead, too.

414
01:28:18,173 --> 01:28:20,132
You ought to know, Frank,
better than anyone.

415
01:28:20,216 --> 01:28:21,550
You killed him.

416
01:28:22,218 --> 01:28:23,427
Who are you?

417
01:28:23,595 --> 01:28:25,888
- Who are you, you...
- Frank!

418
01:28:27,974 --> 01:28:29,475
The woman.

419
01:28:31,895 --> 01:28:33,562
We're only losing time.

420
01:28:39,027 --> 01:28:40,402
All right.

421
01:28:40,737 --> 01:28:43,655
This time,
I'll take care of her personally.

422
01:28:43,907 --> 01:28:46,325
Yeah, it ought to be easy for you.

423
01:28:51,414 --> 01:28:53,248
Keep him warm for me.

424
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:55,918
If he gives you any trouble, hit him.

425
01:28:56,252 --> 01:29:00,130
Not in the mouth.
He's got to talk. And plenty.

426
01:29:05,762 --> 01:29:07,846
Meet me at the Navajo cliff.

427
01:29:07,931 --> 01:29:10,683
By the way, I want you to keep an eye
on that cripple all the time.

428
01:29:10,767 --> 01:29:12,101
- Understand?
- Sure, Frank.

429
01:30:45,236 --> 01:30:47,363
- See anyone?
- No.

430
01:31:07,467 --> 01:31:08,592
There he is.

431
01:33:52,799 --> 01:33:54,883
You only know how to shoot?

432
01:33:56,386 --> 01:33:58,679
Or do you know how to cut, too?

433
01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:11,233
Hey, you.

434
01:34:13,403 --> 01:34:15,237
Wait a minute.

435
01:34:16,406 --> 01:34:18,615
Let's have a good look at you.

436
01:34:29,919 --> 01:34:32,671
Hey. Mr. Choo-Choo.

437
01:34:51,358 --> 01:34:53,233
It's easy to find you.

438
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:54,860
Bastard.

439
01:34:54,944 --> 01:34:56,904
I don't have to kill you now.

440
01:34:56,988 --> 01:34:59,782
You leave a slime behind you
like a snail.

441
01:35:00,325 --> 01:35:03,369
Two beautiful shiny rails.

442
01:35:04,245 --> 01:35:06,246
There's another bastard.

443
01:35:06,956 --> 01:35:10,125
And he's getting further away
every minute.

444
01:35:21,888 --> 01:35:23,055
There it is.

445
01:35:23,139 --> 01:35:24,598
Exactly what your husband ordered
from me.

446
01:35:24,683 --> 01:35:27,184
And seeing as how he paid cash
on the barrelhead,

447
01:35:27,268 --> 01:35:28,811
it all belongs to you.

448
01:35:29,145 --> 01:35:32,147
Oak planks, beech, pine.

449
01:35:32,565 --> 01:35:34,274
All first-grade lumber.

450
01:35:34,359 --> 01:35:37,069
And there's beams
and foundation pylons.

451
01:35:37,362 --> 01:35:41,448
Ten kegs of nails, 20 barrels of tar,
and all these tools.

452
01:35:41,783 --> 01:35:43,867
Maybe he wanted
to enlarge the farmhouse.

453
01:35:43,952 --> 01:35:45,828
Enlarge the farmhouse?

454
01:35:46,371 --> 01:35:49,206
He could have built
at least eight of them.

455
01:35:49,290 --> 01:35:50,958
By the way, ma'am,

456
01:35:51,751 --> 01:35:54,837
McBain also ordered this.
Said it was important.

457
01:35:55,630 --> 01:35:59,133
Only it seems he forgot to tell me
what he wanted printed on it.

458
01:36:06,891 --> 01:36:08,308
Station.

459
01:36:09,978 --> 01:36:10,978
How's that again?

460
01:36:11,479 --> 01:36:13,355
I said print "station."

461
01:36:45,847 --> 01:36:47,473
Looking for this?

462
01:36:48,224 --> 01:36:50,893
I’ve had enough of your butcher tactics.

463
01:36:50,977 --> 01:36:52,895
I know that woman is here.

464
01:36:53,396 --> 01:36:56,023
I don't want any more useless killing.

465
01:36:57,108 --> 01:36:59,443
I'm ready to make a deal for that land.

466
01:36:59,527 --> 01:37:01,487
To pay what's necessary.

467
01:37:01,571 --> 01:37:04,073
I don't want to waste any more time.

468
01:37:04,783 --> 01:37:07,242
You've made a big mistake, Morton.

469
01:37:11,498 --> 01:37:15,834
When you're not on that train,
you look like a turtle out of its shell.

470
01:37:16,169 --> 01:37:17,753
Just funny.

471
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:19,630
Poor cripple talking big

472
01:37:19,714 --> 01:37:22,383
so nobody will know
how scared you are.

473
01:37:22,801 --> 01:37:24,385
I'm here to make a deal, Frank.

474
01:37:27,305 --> 01:37:29,098
I don't have time to compete with you.

475
01:37:35,605 --> 01:37:36,814
Compete?

476
01:37:40,902 --> 01:37:42,569
Why, you...

477
01:37:42,654 --> 01:37:45,906
You can't even stand
on your own feet by yourself.

478
01:37:56,626 --> 01:37:59,294
Is that sufficient
to make you feel stronger?

479
01:38:00,130 --> 01:38:02,756
I could squash you like a wormy apple.

480
01:38:05,218 --> 01:38:08,262
Sure, but you won't do it.

481
01:38:09,305 --> 01:38:12,641
Because it's not to your advantage.

482
01:38:19,774 --> 01:38:22,818
Who knows how far you'd have gone
with two good legs.

483
01:38:31,077 --> 01:38:34,246
Help him back to the train.
Keep your eye on him.

484
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:40,085
Morton. Don't worry about the land.

485
01:38:40,170 --> 01:38:42,087
If you feel like paying for it, you can pay.

486
01:38:42,172 --> 01:38:44,006
Of course, it won't make
any difference to you

487
01:38:44,090 --> 01:38:46,175
dealing with the new owner.

488
01:39:12,869 --> 01:39:15,412
Cheyenne! Hey, Cheyenne!

489
01:39:16,247 --> 01:39:18,791
There's a square staked out here.
It says "water tank."

490
01:39:19,501 --> 01:39:22,920
Over here, too.
Only, it says "post office."

491
01:39:23,505 --> 01:39:25,214
And this one says "corral."

492
01:39:26,216 --> 01:39:28,300
And this here "church."

493
01:39:29,010 --> 01:39:30,761
What the hell is this?

494
01:39:31,221 --> 01:39:32,554
Can't you see?

495
01:39:33,723 --> 01:39:35,265
It's a station.

496
01:39:36,643 --> 01:39:38,686
And all around it, a town.

497
01:39:41,523 --> 01:39:43,273
Brett McBain's town.

498
01:39:45,735 --> 01:39:47,903
Was he crazy!

499
01:39:49,197 --> 01:39:51,490
Yeah, in a very special way.

500
01:39:53,076 --> 01:39:54,451
An Irishman.

501
01:39:56,454 --> 01:39:57,496
He knew, sooner or later,

502
01:39:57,580 --> 01:40:00,874
that railroad coming through Flagstone
would continue on west.

503
01:40:00,959 --> 01:40:03,794
So he looked over
all this country out here

504
01:40:04,879 --> 01:40:07,548
until he found this hunk of desert.

505
01:40:07,632 --> 01:40:09,758
Nobody wanted it.

506
01:40:13,763 --> 01:40:15,055
But he bought it.

507
01:40:17,809 --> 01:40:22,354
Then he tightened his belt,
and for years, he waited.

508
01:40:24,065 --> 01:40:25,649
Waited for what?

509
01:40:27,235 --> 01:40:29,695
For the railroad to reach this point.

510
01:40:30,572 --> 01:40:32,781
But how in the hell could he be sure

511
01:40:32,866 --> 01:40:35,784
the railroad would pass
through his property?

512
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:40,039
Them steam engines
can't roll without water.

513
01:40:40,498 --> 01:40:45,127
And the only water for 50 miles
west of Flagstone is right here.

514
01:40:45,712 --> 01:40:47,296
Under this land.

515
01:40:47,964 --> 01:40:50,841
He was no fool, our dead friend, huh?

516
01:40:51,593 --> 01:40:56,138
He was going to sell this piece of desert
for its weight in gold, wasn't he?

517
01:40:56,723 --> 01:40:59,683
You don't sell the dream of a lifetime.

518
01:41:01,144 --> 01:41:03,645
Brett McBain wanted his station.

519
01:41:06,274 --> 01:41:08,484
He got the rights to build it.

520
01:41:10,653 --> 01:41:13,405
- How do you know all this?
- I saw a document.

521
01:41:13,490 --> 01:41:16,784
It was all in order.
Seals, signatures, everything.

522
01:41:17,827 --> 01:41:19,244
One thing, though.

523
01:41:19,329 --> 01:41:23,499
In very small print,
there is a short clause,

524
01:41:24,334 --> 01:41:28,087
which says that McBain or his heirs
lose all rights

525
01:41:28,171 --> 01:41:31,298
if, by the time
the railroad reaches this point,

526
01:41:32,676 --> 01:41:34,843
the station ain't built yet.

527
01:41:41,851 --> 01:41:45,938
Speaking of railroads,
I noticed the rail gang's already...

528
01:41:46,690 --> 01:41:48,232
Hey.

529
01:41:49,526 --> 01:41:53,237
I noticed the rail gang's
already behind those hills.

530
01:41:53,321 --> 01:41:57,741
And before you know it,
they're gonna be here.

531
01:41:58,201 --> 01:42:01,078
Yeah.

532
01:42:02,539 --> 01:42:03,706
Listen.

533
01:42:04,666 --> 01:42:06,000
Harmonica.

534
01:42:07,043 --> 01:42:10,254
A town built around the railroad.

535
01:42:11,506 --> 01:42:13,716
You could make a fortune, huh?

536
01:42:15,385 --> 01:42:17,803
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

537
01:42:19,222 --> 01:42:20,973
Hey, more than that.

538
01:42:22,434 --> 01:42:24,351
Thousands of thousands.

539
01:42:25,729 --> 01:42:27,730
They call them millions.

540
01:42:29,524 --> 01:42:30,774
Millions?

541
01:42:34,279 --> 01:42:36,655
- Yeah, millions.
- Yeah.

542
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:40,993
I always thought it'd be easier
to make a deal with a smart lady.

543
01:42:41,661 --> 01:42:43,537
All you gotta do is...

544
01:42:46,291 --> 01:42:49,668
Hey, what in the hell
are you standing around for?

545
01:42:50,086 --> 01:42:52,338
But, chief, what are we supposed to do?

546
01:42:52,422 --> 01:42:54,506
What are you supposed to do?

547
01:42:54,591 --> 01:42:57,259
Build a station, idiots!

548
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:03,057
I figure it ain't gonna look like much.

549
01:43:06,102 --> 01:43:10,022
But it'll be the first thing she sees
when she gets back.

550
01:43:11,274 --> 01:43:12,900
If she gets back.

551
01:44:33,064 --> 01:44:34,398
I think...

552
01:44:43,074 --> 01:44:44,199
Yeah.

553
01:44:45,410 --> 01:44:49,538
I'm beginning to think
I might be a little sorry killing you.

554
01:44:52,042 --> 01:44:53,834
You like being alive.

555
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:10,809
You also like to feel
a man's hands all over you.

556
01:45:12,812 --> 01:45:14,229
You like it.

557
01:45:18,651 --> 01:45:22,446
Even if they're the hands of the man
who killed your husband.

558
01:45:42,509 --> 01:45:43,759
What a...

559
01:45:47,389 --> 01:45:49,139
What a little tramp.

560
01:45:52,268 --> 01:45:56,271
Is there anything in the world
you wouldn't do to save your skin?

561
01:45:59,943 --> 01:46:01,485
Nothing, Frank.

562
01:46:25,343 --> 01:46:28,303
Now I understand
why they miss you so much

563
01:46:29,848 --> 01:46:33,726
down there in New Orleans.

564
01:46:36,354 --> 01:46:38,981
Great invention, the telegraph.

565
01:46:42,485 --> 01:46:45,237
"Jill? The brunette?

566
01:46:45,947 --> 01:46:47,573
"My God, all the customers

567
01:46:47,657 --> 01:46:50,242
"of the most elegant whorehouse
on Bourbon Street

568
01:46:50,326 --> 01:46:53,328
"have been weeping ever since she left."

569
01:46:55,790 --> 01:46:57,249
Say, tell me.

570
01:46:58,752 --> 01:47:00,502
Did old McBain know?

571
01:47:01,421 --> 01:47:02,504
Yeah.

572
01:47:04,007 --> 01:47:05,758
Yeah, I bet he did.

573
01:47:06,426 --> 01:47:09,011
He was just the type to marry a whore.

574
01:47:12,349 --> 01:47:13,432
Hey.

575
01:47:15,185 --> 01:47:16,643
It's an idea.

576
01:47:19,064 --> 01:47:20,731
I could marry you.

577
01:47:22,192 --> 01:47:24,485
And the land would become mine.

578
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:26,570
And maybe

579
01:47:29,449 --> 01:47:31,492
you'd make a perfect wife.

580
01:47:35,872 --> 01:47:39,583
It would be me who wouldn't be
any good as a husband.

581
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:42,211
Too bad.

582
01:47:43,213 --> 01:47:45,923
We'll have to think of another solution.

583
01:47:46,341 --> 01:47:47,883
Simpler.

584
01:47:53,223 --> 01:47:54,473
Quicker.

585
01:48:16,621 --> 01:48:18,789
As sheriff of this county,

586
01:48:18,873 --> 01:48:22,292
I’ve been asked to preside
over the sale by auction

587
01:48:22,377 --> 01:48:26,922
of all property belonging
to Mrs. Jill McBain, here present.

588
01:48:27,382 --> 01:48:30,843
This parcel of land measures 320 acres.

589
01:48:30,927 --> 01:48:35,180
It's free of all encumbrances,
liens and mortgages.

590
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:38,350
This property and all it contains,

591
01:48:38,435 --> 01:48:40,686
lock, stock and barrel,

592
01:48:40,770 --> 01:48:44,314
will be turned over to the lucky
purchaser at the time of sale.

593
01:48:44,399 --> 01:48:47,151
All the contents therein
are listed by number

594
01:48:47,235 --> 01:48:50,154
on the inventory sheet
distributed among you.

595
01:48:50,238 --> 01:48:54,158
The entire property will be sold
in block to the highest bidder.

596
01:48:54,242 --> 01:48:55,784
All right. That's clear to everybody.

597
01:48:57,704 --> 01:48:59,371
I declare the auction open.

598
01:48:59,873 --> 01:49:02,499
Now, who's going to make the first bid?

599
01:49:07,130 --> 01:49:11,258
A list of all the items.
Some of them are worth money.

600
01:49:12,344 --> 01:49:15,971
All right.
Now, who's going to make the first bid?

601
01:49:19,934 --> 01:49:21,477
$200.

602
01:49:22,479 --> 01:49:24,980
Well, I have an opening bid of $200.

603
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:28,901
$200. Do I hear more?

604
01:49:28,985 --> 01:49:31,737
That stinking piece of land ain't worth it.

605
01:49:31,821 --> 01:49:32,946
Is it, old-timer?

606
01:49:33,031 --> 01:49:36,075
Come on, my friends, $200.

607
01:49:36,618 --> 01:49:39,536
The livestock alone
is worth twice that much.

608
01:49:41,164 --> 01:49:42,331
Well...

609
01:49:43,541 --> 01:49:45,834
Who's going to bid $300?

610
01:49:49,881 --> 01:49:51,590
Now, look, friends,

611
01:49:51,675 --> 01:49:54,843
I realize we're not offering
California here,

612
01:49:54,928 --> 01:49:58,180
but 200 is damn little
for all that property.

613
01:49:58,264 --> 01:50:02,351
Ladies and gentlemen,
I wouldn't even take 200 as a deposit.

614
01:50:05,689 --> 01:50:09,108
Well, nobody's going to bid it up.

615
01:50:17,450 --> 01:50:20,494
You're sure you wouldn't want
to set a minimum price?

616
01:50:22,622 --> 01:50:24,999
I wish I were wrong, Mrs. McBain,

617
01:50:25,083 --> 01:50:28,043
but you're liable to end up selling
the place for a plate of beans.

618
01:50:35,468 --> 01:50:37,511
All I want is to sell.

619
01:51:44,412 --> 01:51:47,164
- You look fat, huh?
- If you say so.

620
01:51:48,333 --> 01:51:50,125
- How many?
- One card.

621
01:51:52,671 --> 01:51:54,046
One for me.

622
01:51:56,966 --> 01:51:58,717
Dealer takes three.

623
01:52:09,312 --> 01:52:11,605
Can l... Can I take a hand?

624
01:52:18,154 --> 01:52:19,405
Fifteen.

625
01:52:32,794 --> 01:52:34,753
Yeah, sit down.

626
01:52:58,445 --> 01:52:59,778
I'll deal.

627
01:54:44,968 --> 01:54:46,427
How do you...

628
01:54:47,804 --> 01:54:50,514
How do you play this game, Mr. Morton?

629
01:54:53,226 --> 01:54:54,852
It's very simple.

630
01:54:56,187 --> 01:55:00,733
As long as you use your head,
you never lose.

631
01:55:01,609 --> 01:55:10,200
$500.

632
01:55:12,370 --> 01:55:14,371
Do I hear any other bids?

633
01:55:16,791 --> 01:55:18,417
I don't think so.

634
01:55:27,761 --> 01:55:29,136
I'm sorry, Mrs. McBain,

635
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:34,183
but I think I'm gonna have to
knock down on that last bid.

636
01:55:45,236 --> 01:55:46,904
$500 once.

637
01:55:50,158 --> 01:55:52,368
$500 twice.

638
01:55:55,372 --> 01:55:57,831
- $500...
- $5,000.

639
01:56:21,731 --> 01:56:26,026
- You said $5,000?
- It's on its way.

640
01:56:38,998 --> 01:56:40,833
It's Cheyenne!

641
01:56:50,593 --> 01:56:53,679
The reward for this man
is $5,000, that right?

642
01:56:54,097 --> 01:56:58,142
Judas was content with $4,970 less.

643
01:56:58,768 --> 01:57:01,270
There were no dollars in them days.

644
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:05,774
But sons of bitches, yeah.

645
01:57:19,956 --> 01:57:22,041
Hey, wait a minute.

646
01:57:24,085 --> 01:57:26,920
- The jail's that way.
- Yeah, I know.

647
01:57:27,297 --> 01:57:30,716
Yeah, but you're going
to the railroad station.

648
01:57:31,718 --> 01:57:34,303
I'm sending you to Yuma, Cheyenne.

649
01:57:34,387 --> 01:57:36,430
They got a modern jail there.

650
01:57:36,765 --> 01:57:41,143
It's got more walls, more bars,
more guards.

651
01:57:41,978 --> 01:57:45,814
You'll like it, in 20 years. You'll see.

652
01:58:47,210 --> 01:58:50,504
Two tickets, amigo, to the next station.

653
01:58:50,588 --> 01:58:52,047
One way only.

654
01:58:54,843 --> 01:58:57,678
Here's to you. And congratulations.

655
01:59:02,559 --> 01:59:04,768
You got yourself a good deal.

656
01:59:06,229 --> 01:59:07,604
The auction.

657
01:59:08,732 --> 01:59:12,151
Forget it. I don't invest in land.

658
01:59:14,779 --> 01:59:19,241
You don't look at all like the noble
defender of poor defenseless widows.

659
01:59:21,244 --> 01:59:22,745
But then again,

660
01:59:25,623 --> 01:59:28,751
I don't look like
a poor defenseless widow.

661
01:59:35,592 --> 01:59:37,801
Cheyenne's right.
You're a remarkable woman.

662
01:59:39,804 --> 01:59:41,889
And you're a remarkable man.

663
01:59:42,724 --> 01:59:45,267
But you have something on your mind.

664
01:59:51,024 --> 01:59:53,150
And you got something on your mind.

665
01:59:56,821 --> 02:00:00,783
Hot water. A bathtub full of hot water.

666
02:00:19,511 --> 02:00:22,221
I think it's time I filled that bathtub.

667
02:00:53,169 --> 02:00:54,378
Who are you?

668
02:01:15,984 --> 02:01:17,359
Jim Cooper.

669
02:01:18,361 --> 02:01:20,029
Chuck Youngblood.

670
02:01:21,031 --> 02:01:22,531
More dead men.

671
02:01:26,369 --> 02:01:29,371
They were all alive
until they met you, Frank.

672
02:01:35,628 --> 02:01:38,797
You paid $5,000 for something
that belongs to me.

673
02:01:44,012 --> 02:01:45,179
5,000.

674
02:01:50,310 --> 02:01:52,227
Plus one.

675
02:01:57,776 --> 02:01:59,985
You've got a right to make a profit, too.

676
02:02:27,097 --> 02:02:30,182
I wouldn't take too long thinking about it,
if I were you.

677
02:02:35,063 --> 02:02:37,356
You got yourself into something
that's bigger than you are.

678
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:40,109
You got a chance to get out easy.
You better take it.

679
02:02:40,568 --> 02:02:43,278
You sound like
a real businessman, Frank.

680
02:02:44,114 --> 02:02:47,324
Being with Mr. Morton
has done you a lot of good.

681
02:02:54,874 --> 02:02:56,834
And you've learned some new methods.

682
02:02:59,170 --> 02:03:02,089
Yeah, Mr. Morton has shown you
a lot of new ways.

683
02:03:06,845 --> 02:03:09,471
Even though
you haven't given up the old ones.

684
02:03:10,724 --> 02:03:13,642
Pick any method you like.
Just make the deal.

685
02:03:16,438 --> 02:03:18,105
Which deal, Frank?

686
02:03:21,234 --> 02:03:23,068
We have more than one, you and me.

687
02:03:26,906 --> 02:03:32,411
We can lump them together
into one bundle, settle all of them.

688
02:03:33,038 --> 02:03:34,496
Here and now.

689
02:03:36,750 --> 02:03:38,500
Easy, Frank.

690
02:03:39,169 --> 02:03:40,294
Easy.

691
02:03:41,463 --> 02:03:43,630
You gotta learn not to push things.

692
02:03:43,882 --> 02:03:46,842
Taking it easy is the first thing
a businessman should do.

693
02:03:50,180 --> 02:03:53,849
I got an idea Mr. Morton
can teach you a lot more.

694
02:03:57,854 --> 02:03:59,146
How much?

695
02:04:00,523 --> 02:04:01,857
$1 .

696
02:05:06,965 --> 02:06:44,353
Giddy up!

697
02:07:48,543 --> 02:07:51,211
I could swear we're going to have
that strange sound.

698
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:52,629
Right now.

699
02:09:45,577 --> 02:09:46,994
Time sure flies.

700
02:09:48,788 --> 02:09:50,581
It's already past 12:00.

701
02:10:50,225 --> 02:10:52,601
But... But they were his men.

702
02:10:52,686 --> 02:10:55,104
- Yeah.
- And they tried to kill him.

703
02:10:55,563 --> 02:10:57,439
They must have found somebody
who pays better.

704
02:10:57,524 --> 02:10:58,565
And you!

705
02:10:58,983 --> 02:11:00,859
You saved his life.

706
02:11:03,488 --> 02:11:06,615
I didn't let them kill him
and that's not the same thing.

707
02:11:19,462 --> 02:11:20,879
Sure.

708
02:11:21,464 --> 02:11:23,924
It's not the same thing.

709
02:11:31,266 --> 02:11:32,850
You get dressed.

710
02:11:33,268 --> 02:11:34,685
It's time to go home.

711
02:16:54,297 --> 02:16:56,048
Did you make coffee?

712
02:16:57,592 --> 02:16:59,176
This time I did.

713
02:17:39,676 --> 02:17:40,759
Good.

714
02:17:43,388 --> 02:17:46,515
My mother used to make
coffee this way.

715
02:17:47,350 --> 02:17:52,021
Hot, strong and good.

716
02:18:01,531 --> 02:18:03,198
Cheyenne.

717
02:18:05,410 --> 02:18:07,745
What's he waiting for out there?

718
02:18:10,373 --> 02:18:11,498
What's he doing?

719
02:18:17,505 --> 02:18:19,923
He's whittling on a piece of wood.

720
02:18:22,469 --> 02:18:25,179
I got a feeling when he stops whittling,

721
02:18:26,639 --> 02:18:30,934
something's gonna happen.

722
02:19:37,210 --> 02:19:39,211
Surprised to see me here?

723
02:19:41,339 --> 02:19:43,007
I knew you'd come.

724
02:20:06,698 --> 02:20:09,700
Morton once told me
I could never be like him.

725
02:20:11,036 --> 02:20:12,828
Now I understand why.

726
02:20:15,165 --> 02:20:19,501
Wouldn't have bothered him, knowing
you were around somewhere alive.

727
02:20:20,670 --> 02:20:24,006
So you found out
you're not a businessman after all?

728
02:20:24,549 --> 02:20:25,716
Just a man.

729
02:20:28,386 --> 02:20:30,012
An ancient race.

730
02:20:36,394 --> 02:20:40,689
Other Mortons will be along
and they'll kill it off.

731
02:20:41,066 --> 02:20:43,025
The future don't matter to us.

732
02:20:43,902 --> 02:20:45,110
Nothing matters now.

733
02:20:45,195 --> 02:20:48,530
Not the land, not the money,
not the woman.

734
02:20:49,157 --> 02:20:51,033
I came here to see you.

735
02:20:53,620 --> 02:20:56,705
'Cause I know that now
you'll tell me what you're after.

736
02:21:12,013 --> 02:21:14,098
Only at the point of dying.

737
02:21:17,435 --> 02:21:18,644
I know.

738
02:22:03,314 --> 02:22:07,026
I heated some water for you.
I also found a razor.

739
02:22:07,986 --> 02:22:10,112
Put it there, please.

740
02:22:12,532 --> 02:22:16,243
So I can watch the railroad move up
while I shave.

741
02:22:22,751 --> 02:22:24,126
You know what?

742
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:28,589
If I was you, I'd go down there
and give those boys a drink.

743
02:22:38,224 --> 02:22:39,850
You can't imagine

744
02:22:41,144 --> 02:22:44,313
how happy it makes a man
to see a woman like you.

745
02:22:46,775 --> 02:22:48,525
Just to look at her.

746
02:22:52,238 --> 02:22:55,491
And if one of them
should pat your behind,

747
02:22:57,535 --> 02:23:00,162
just make believe it's nothing.

748
02:23:03,124 --> 02:23:04,667
They earned it.

749
02:27:38,942 --> 02:27:41,276
Keep your loving brother happy.

750
02:31:00,226 --> 02:31:02,644
Who... Who are you?

751
02:32:10,422 --> 02:32:14,258
Hey. You're sort of a handsome man.

752
02:32:17,387 --> 02:32:19,430
But I'm not the right man.

753
02:32:32,318 --> 02:32:33,986
And neither is he.

754
02:32:36,823 --> 02:32:38,157
Maybe not.

755
02:32:38,742 --> 02:32:40,242
But it doesn't matter.

756
02:32:44,622 --> 02:32:46,749
You don't understand, Jill.

757
02:32:48,293 --> 02:32:51,253
People like that have something inside.

758
02:32:53,590 --> 02:32:55,883
Something to do with death.

759
02:32:59,262 --> 02:33:03,432
If that fella lives,
he'll come in through that door,

760
02:33:04,309 --> 02:33:06,602
pick up his gear and say adios.

761
02:33:12,359 --> 02:33:14,985
It would be nice to see this town grow.

762
02:34:47,037 --> 02:34:48,370
Now I gotta go.

763
02:35:34,668 --> 02:35:38,253
Gonna be a beautiful town, Sweetwater.

764
02:35:42,926 --> 02:35:45,260
I hope you'll come back someday.

765
02:36:03,029 --> 02:36:04,279
Someday.

766
02:36:16,668 --> 02:36:20,546
Yeah. I gotta go, too.

767
02:36:46,489 --> 02:36:48,532
Make believe it's nothing.

768
02:38:54,117 --> 02:38:55,784
Sorry, Harmonica.

769
02:38:56,327 --> 02:38:58,328
I gotta stay here.

770
02:39:36,910 --> 02:39:37,993
Who?

771
02:39:41,706 --> 02:39:43,707
I ran into Mr. Choo-Choo.

772
02:39:44,751 --> 02:39:48,170
I didn't count on
that half-man from the train.

773
02:39:49,005 --> 02:39:51,006
He got scared.

774
02:40:09,484 --> 02:40:11,026
Hey, Harmonica.

775
02:40:12,529 --> 02:40:14,279
When they do you in,

776
02:40:15,031 --> 02:40:17,533
pray it's somebody
who knows where to shoot.

777
02:40:33,383 --> 02:40:38,804
Go away.

778
02:40:39,514 --> 02:40:42,558
Go away. I don't want you to see me die.
