So you found out
you're not a businessman after all?

02:20:24,733 --> 02:20:25,899

you'll tell me what you're after.

02:22:03,498 --> 02:22:07,209
I heated some water for you.
I also found a razor.

901
02:22:08,169 --> 02:22:10,295
Put it there, please.

If I was you, I'd go down there
and give those boys a drink.

how happy it makes a man
to see a woman like you.

should pat your behind,

People like that have
something inside.

Something to do with death.

923
02:32:59,446 --> 02:33:03,616
If that fella lives,
he'll come in through that door,
