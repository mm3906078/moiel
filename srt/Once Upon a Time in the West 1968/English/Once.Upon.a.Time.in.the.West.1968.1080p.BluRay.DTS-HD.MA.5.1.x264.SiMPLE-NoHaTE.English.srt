Hmm.

01:04:47,218 --> 01:04:49,262
Yeah. (LAUGHS)

341

a whole heap of whys?

349

By the way,

350

you know anything about a man
going around playing a harmonica?

351

He's somebody you'd remember.

352
01:05:34,057 --> 01:05:36,267
Instead of talking, he plays.

353

And when he'd better play, he talks.

354

killed four, it's easy to make it five.

you ain't caught the idea.

of a bandit who smelled money.

over the table and amuse yourself.

Tell me, was it necessary
that you kill all of them?

370
01:07:01,436 --> 01:07:03,646
I only told you to scare them.

371
01:07:04,772 --> 01:07:07,400

was your stupid massacre?

It happens in business.

375
01:07:21,456 --> 01:07:24,792

I got on board in sight of the Atlantic,

and before my eyes rot,

380
01:07:40,391 --> 01:07:44,562
I want to see the blue of the Pacific
outside that window.

Don't play the sick man with me,

Otherwise you ain't changed any.

I'd say you've changed, Frank.

You used to take care
of certain things personally.

Now, you're keeping in the background.

You'll end up giving orders.

400
01:09:05,893 --> 01:09:09,814
It's because, now, I don't want
to leave you alone too much.

401
01:09:11,816 --> 01:09:15,278
You're gonna need somebody more
and more every day to stay near you.

How does it feel
sitting behind that desk, Frank?

405
01:09:36,299 --> 01:09:38,926
It's almost like holding a gun.

My weapons might look simple to you,
Mr. Morton,

big enough for our little problems.

Pretty soon the widow McBain
won't be a problem no more.

You wake up one morning and say,

"From now on,

And then you happen
to meet a man like this,

Clear eyes, strong hands.

429
01:12:35,311 --> 01:12:37,355
And he wants to marry you.

430
01:12:37,813 --> 01:12:39,607
Which doesn't happen often.

But he bought it.

641
01:40:17,805 --> 01:40:22,351
Then he tightened his belt,
and for years, he waited.

642
01:40:24,061 --> 01:40:25,646
Waited for what?

643
01:40:27,231 --> 01:40:29,692
For the railroad to reach this point.

644
01:40:30,568 --> 01:40:32,778
Ah, but how in the hell could he be sure

645
01:40:32,862 --> 01:40:35,781
the railroad would pass
through his property?

646
01:40:37,116 --> 01:40:40,036
Them steam engines
can't roll without water.

And the only water for 50 miles
west of Flagstone is right here.

- Under this land.
- A-ha!

He was no fool, our dead friend, huh?

650
01:40:51,589 --> 01:40:56,135
He was going to sell this piece of desert
for its weight in gold, wasn't he?

if I were you.

that's bigger than you are.

a lot of new ways.
