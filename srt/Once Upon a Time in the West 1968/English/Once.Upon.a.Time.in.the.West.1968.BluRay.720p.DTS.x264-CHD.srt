1
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:44,354
Hey!

2
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:46,147
If you want any tickets,

3
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:50,860
you'll have to go around
to the front of...

4
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,696
Well, I suppose it'll be all right.

5
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,907
What the hell am
I doing around here?

6
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,809
They walk in here and...

7
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:05,851
Let's see. I hope I got...

8
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,020
Three?

9
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:25,329
That'll be $7...

10
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,586
and 50 cents.

11
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:06,870
Shh.

12
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,053
No.

13
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,813
Frank?

14
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,609
Frank sent us.

15
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,156
Did you bring a horse for me?

16
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:53,707
Well, looks like we're...

17
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,359
Looks like we're shy one horse.

18
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,552
You brought two too many.

19
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,030
Hey, Pa!

20
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,507
Look!

21
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:16,451
That's enough for now. It's
getting late. Come on home.

22
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,127
Boo!

23
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,508
Timmy.

24
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,103
Maureen, look.

25
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:28,982
Hmm.

26
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,484
Ah!

27
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:08,545
What you doing there? Go inside,
quick, and get washed.

28
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,298
And don't touch the
apple pie or the roast.

29
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,927
Patrick's already left
for the station, huh?

30
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,887
He's getting ready, Pa.

31
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:19,240
- Damn it, Patrick!
- Coming, Pa.

32
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,954
Not bad, I'd say.

33
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:30,043
Bigger, them slices. What the hell?
We're throwing a party, ain't we?

34
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:33,463
But these are the
same slices as usual.

35
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,344
Yeah, sure.

36
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,889
As usual.

37
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,976
Maureen.

38
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:54,651
Soon, you can out the bread in slices
as big as a door if you want to.

39
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,553
You'll have beautiful new clothes

40
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,447
and you won't have to work no more.

41
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,493
We're going to get rich, Pa?

42
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,999
Who knows?

43
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,335
Patrick!

44
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,004
Wait a minute!

45
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,175
Look at the filth on your
boots. Clean them.

46
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,206
The train will come in

47
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,142
and there won't be no one
to meet your mother.

48
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,688
Our mother died six years ago.

49
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,451
Go now, or you'll really be late.

50
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:52,774
Just a minute. Listen, Pa.
How am I gonna recognize her?

51
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,985
You can't make no mistake, Patrick.

52
00:19:54,986 --> 00:20:00,758
She's young and she's
pretty and she's a lady.

53
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:07,056
"For traveling, I'll be
wearing a black dress"

54
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:14,272
"and the same straw hat that
I was wearing when we met."

55
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,536
I'm gonna get some fresh
water from the well.

56
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,565
<i>Oh, Danny boy</i>

57
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:37,837
<i>The pipes, the pipes are calling</i>

58
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:44,159
<i>And down the mountain side</i>

59
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,054
<i>The summer's gone</i>

60
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:50,475
<i>And all the roses fall...</i>

61
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,199
Maureen!

62
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:58,454
What are we gonna do
with this one, Frank?

63
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,013
Now that you've
called me by name...

64
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:59,224
I saw some mighty fine
stock down south.

65
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,910
Is that so?

66
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,454
And the prices are good.

67
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:16,241
- These your valises, ma'am?
- Yes.

68
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,493
- Come, Sarah.
- Bring them other two.

69
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,888
We'll tote them for you, ma'am.

70
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,811
Is that true?
The sawmill needs hands?

71
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:47,731
- Was yesterday.
- Why didn't you tell your brother?

72
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:50,525
- Hiya, Gramps.
- Hiya, Bill. We're back again.

73
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:53,003
Come on. Get a move on, will you?

74
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,696
Ha!

75
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:58,158
Get the lead out of your asses,
you redskin warriors.

76
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,452
I got a whole train to unload.

77
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:03,705
All right, chuck down
those feed sacks first.

78
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:06,267
Come on! Come on!

79
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,520
What's the name of the
place you wanted to go?

80
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:58,564
Sweetwater.

81
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:01,007
Hmm?

82
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,818
Brett McBain's farm.

83
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,347
McBain? Yeah, sure.

84
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:09,849
That stubborn redheaded Irishman,

85
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,811
tilling sand for years way out
there in the middle of nowhere.

86
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,688
Sweetwater!

87
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,732
Only a loony like him could call

88
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,902
that stinking piece
of desert Sweetwater.

89
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:23,339
Sweetwater!

90
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:29,094
That's good! Sweetwater!

91
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,748
That's right.
A little more to the right.

92
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,643
Higher. Higher.

93
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,105
Hold it there.

94
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:33,474
Here they are. Even got
here with their damn rails.

95
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:36,995
They caught up with us again,
eh, Lafayette? Let's go!

96
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,873
Hey, slow down. What's the
matter with you? Slow down!

97
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,217
Hey, boys! Watch out!

98
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,194
Watch out down there!

99
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:46,714
Slow down!

100
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:47,566
Whoa!

101
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,431
Why are we stopping?
I told you I was in a hurry.

102
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,826
Don't the train stop?

103
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:47,436
What can I do for you, ma'am?

104
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,254
I would like some water,
if it's no trouble.

105
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,523
Water?

106
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:54,926
Well, you see, that word is
poison around these parts

107
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:57,303
ever since the days
of the great flood.

108
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:00,807
- You mean you never wash?
- We sure do!

109
00:35:00,808 --> 00:35:03,601
Well, I'd like to use the same
facilities you people do.

110
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,228
You sure can.

111
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:07,355
Just happen to have a
full tub in the back.

112
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:08,731
And you're lucky.

113
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,751
Only three people have
used it this morning.

114
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:14,338
Used it one at a time
or all together?

115
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,328
I can tell you're
accustomed to fine living.

116
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:25,581
Bet you come from one of
those big eastern cities.

117
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:28,060
- New Orleans.
- New Orleans!

118
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,312
- You've been there?
- No.

119
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:33,005
But I got a cousin down
there. She runs a bar.

120
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:35,359
You know, she...

121
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:17,586
Jug.

122
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:27,716
Do you only know how to play
or do you know how to shoot?

123
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:34,848
Do you know how to
blow music from that?

124
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:56,912
Pick it up.

125
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:23,897
You!

126
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:33,448
You don't know how to play.

127
00:40:57,831 --> 00:40:59,557
Try this one.

128
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,157
Take it.

129
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:36,845
Go on.

130
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,524
Here.

131
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:31,941
Bravo.

132
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,384
Cheyenne.

133
00:42:57,826 --> 00:42:59,660
We thought we'd never make it.

134
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:02,597
It's all right.
You're right on time.

135
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:07,394
To bury my escort.

136
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:11,689
If I'd waited for you,
I'd be in jail by now.

137
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:29,874
Hey.

138
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:40,260
The gun.

139
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:05,368
You interested in
fashions, Harmonica?

140
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,902
I saw three of these
dusters a short time ago.

141
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:16,203
They were waiting for a train.

142
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:25,680
Inside the clusters,
there were three men.

143
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:28,808
So?

144
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:33,897
Inside the men, there
were three bullets.

145
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:48,495
That's a crazy story, Harmonica.

146
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,165
For two reasons.

147
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,026
One, nobody around these
parts got the guts

148
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:59,047
to wear those dusters
except Cheyenne's men.

149
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:03,760
Two, Cheyenne's men
don't get killed.

150
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,557
That surprise you?

151
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:11,601
Yeah.

152
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:18,066
Well, you know music.

153
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:21,986
And you can count.
All the way up to two.

154
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:32,997
All the way up to
six, if I have to.

155
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:36,084
And maybe faster than you.

156
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,058
Yeah, go on.

157
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,394
Play, Harmonica.

158
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:57,146
Play, so you can't bullshit.

159
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,276
Only, watch those false notes.

160
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:11,744
Like so?

161
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,035
And so, this cousin of mine

162
00:46:28,036 --> 00:46:29,953
keeps writing me to come
on down to New Orleans.

163
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:33,766
"Come on down. Help me with
the bar. Make a pile of money."

164
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:37,002
I don't think I'd get
along in a big city.

165
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:39,546
It's too full of fast
men and loose women.

166
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,150
Begging your pardon, ma'am. Ah, no.

167
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:47,488
Now, I'm too used to a
quiet, simple country life.

168
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:19,891
He's Timmy.

169
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:22,059
Yes.

170
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,854
Dear God.

171
00:49:26,214 --> 00:49:28,316
On the day...

172
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:32,779
On the very day of your wedding.

173
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:34,947
Poor little miss.

174
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:38,451
Mrs...

175
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:41,937
Mrs. McBain.

176
00:49:41,938 --> 00:49:44,874
But we all... Oh, but we thought...

177
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:47,442
I know.

178
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:49,796
It was to be a surprise today.

179
00:49:51,531 --> 00:49:53,966
Brett McBain and I were married.

180
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:56,093
A month ago.

181
00:49:56,536 --> 00:49:58,846
In New Orleans.

182
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:17,723
"I am the resurrection,
and the life."

183
00:50:17,724 --> 00:50:21,435
"He that believeth in me, though
he were dead, yet shall he live."

184
00:50:21,436 --> 00:50:24,980
"Whosoever liveth and believeth
in me shall never die."

185
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:26,207
Amen.

186
00:50:41,873 --> 00:50:44,892
- Mr. Bennett!
- What's he doing here?

187
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:50,982
I found this collar on
a nail by the door.

188
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:58,722
You got no way of knowing, but
this is as good as a signature.

189
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:00,908
Cheyenne's hand.

190
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:06,271
- But why?
- Don't worry, Mrs. McBain.

191
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:08,916
We'll make them tell us
before we hang them.

192
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:12,336
Let's get moving.

193
00:51:31,506 --> 00:51:32,857
Come on.

194
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:35,735
Let's go back to Flagstone.

195
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,531
No, Sam.

196
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,534
You go back.

197
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:47,538
You don't want to
stay out here alone.

198
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:50,541
Why not?

199
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,585
This is my home.

200
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:53,450
You know, Wobbles,

201
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,037
I'm kind of mad at you.

202
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:03,377
Frank wasn't there.

203
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:07,072
He sent three friends.

204
00:56:07,073 --> 00:56:09,884
I don't know nothing, I swear.

205
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:14,597
I only arranged the meeting
the way you wanted it.

206
00:56:15,081 --> 00:56:18,058
I don't know why
Frank wasn't there.

207
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:21,979
- I swear to you that I...
- 'Cause he was at the McBains'.

208
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:25,298
That's not true.
Cheyenne did that job.

209
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:28,194
Everyone knows that. We got proof.

210
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,637
That was always one
of Frank's tricks.

211
00:56:30,638 --> 00:56:32,472
Faking evidence.

212
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,951
I don't know.

213
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,560
I swear.

214
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:42,023
I only arranged the
meeting. I swear.

215
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:44,585
I don't know nothing.

216
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:46,623
Who's there?

217
01:01:18,926 --> 01:01:20,819
Did you make coffee?

218
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:26,200
Make it.

219
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,876
Didn't sleep a wink.

220
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:41,089
A pack of turds dressed in black rode
herd on me the whole damn night.

221
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:46,911
Yeah, but I left them in
the middle of the desert.

222
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:49,223
If they're lucky, they'll
be home in three days.

223
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:12,079
I'll do it. You fetch the coffee.

224
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:22,256
They want to hang me,
the big black crows.

225
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:25,842
Idiots.

226
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,095
What the hell?

227
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:31,348
I'll kill anything,
but never a kid.

228
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,142
Be like killing a priest.

229
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:37,145
A Catholic priest, that is.

230
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:41,191
Yeah, the world is full of
people who hate Cheyenne.

231
01:02:56,648 --> 01:03:00,919
See, I ain't the mean
bastard people make out.

232
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:09,303
Of course, if somebody
had a mind to kill me,

233
01:03:11,497 --> 01:03:13,140
it fires me up.

234
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:17,769
And a fired-up Cheyenne

235
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:21,982
ain't a nice thing to see.

236
01:03:22,508 --> 01:03:24,818
Especially for a lady.

237
01:03:37,606 --> 01:03:40,667
But you're too smart
to make him mad.

238
01:03:45,906 --> 01:03:50,344
So this here's where I was supposed
to do all the killing? Hmm?

239
01:03:50,953 --> 01:03:52,346
Yeah.

240
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:57,351
Don't seem the place
is worth a shit.

241
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:07,861
Now, if somebody gets
dressed up to look like me,

242
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:14,284
so they can hang this
thing around my neck,

243
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:17,704
I don't like it none.

244
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,916
But I can understand it.

245
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:25,045
Hmm.

246
01:04:25,404 --> 01:04:29,299
What I don't understand is why.

247
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:32,803
Neither do I.

248
01:04:37,124 --> 01:04:40,894
But I see you looked
a lot for the why.

249
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:49,361
Yeah.

250
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:55,158
What if there were a
whole heap of whys?

251
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:59,329
Round. Yellow.

252
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,582
You know the kind.

253
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:05,919
You rap them on a stone

254
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,880
and they go "ding."

255
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:10,799
Maybe.

256
01:05:13,285 --> 01:05:15,595
But I didn't find them.

257
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:18,890
Hmm.

258
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:22,853
By the way,

259
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:27,232
you know anything about a man
going around playing a harmonica?

260
01:05:30,135 --> 01:05:32,070
He's somebody you'd remember.

261
01:05:34,056 --> 01:05:36,366
Instead of talking, he plays.

262
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:40,412
And when he'd better
play, he talks.

263
01:05:45,025 --> 01:05:48,545
You know, ma'am, when you've killed
four, it's easy to make it five.

264
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:55,302
Sure. You're an expert.

265
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:03,101
Ma'am, it seems to me you
ain't caught the idea.

266
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,358
Of course I have.

267
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:14,696
I'm here alone in the hands of
a bandit who smelled money.

268
01:06:15,222 --> 01:06:18,450
If you want to, you can lay me
over the table and amuse yourself.

269
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,393
And even call in your men.

270
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:23,330
Well, no woman ever died from that.

271
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:27,083
When you're finished, all I'll need
will be a tub of boiling water,

272
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:29,920
and I'll be exactly
what I was before.

273
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:33,840
With just another filthy memory.

274
01:06:50,132 --> 01:06:52,526
You make good coffee, at least?

275
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:54,820
Not bad.

276
01:06:55,387 --> 01:06:57,072
Congratulations.

277
01:06:57,639 --> 01:07:01,243
Tell me, was it necessary
that you kill all of them?

278
01:07:01,435 --> 01:07:03,745
I only told you to scare them.

279
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:07,499
People scare better
when they're dying.

280
01:07:08,108 --> 01:07:11,670
And can you tell me what good
was your stupid massacre?

281
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:15,257
Now, a Mrs. McBain has turned up.

282
01:07:17,826 --> 01:07:21,263
So, I didn't expect that.
It happens in business.

283
01:07:21,455 --> 01:07:24,891
Let's say this is something
I didn't plan on.

284
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:28,562
I have no time for
surprises, Frank.

285
01:07:30,005 --> 01:07:31,773
You know that.

286
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:36,653
I got on board in sight
of the Atlantic,

287
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,989
and before my eyes rot,

288
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:44,661
I want to see the blue of the
Pacific outside that window.

289
01:07:46,313 --> 01:07:48,189
I know where you got on board.

290
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:50,917
I was there, too, remember?

291
01:07:55,697 --> 01:08:01,428
"To remove small obstacles
from the track," you said.

292
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:05,080
Well, there were a few.

293
01:08:09,211 --> 01:08:12,129
But we traveled a long
way, just the same.

294
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:13,273
And fast.

295
01:08:13,882 --> 01:08:17,903
Even tuberculosis of the
bones travels fast.

296
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:23,575
Don't play the sick man
with me, Mr. Morton.

297
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:27,120
I knew you when you were
just barely limping.

298
01:08:29,648 --> 01:08:33,960
I watch that dry rot rise
a little more every day.

299
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:38,989
Any normal man would put
a bullet in his brain.

300
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:43,219
But you, you just got
a little more hasty.

301
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:46,288
Otherwise you ain't changed any.

302
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:48,916
I'd say you've changed, Frank.

303
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:50,393
A lot.

304
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:55,315
You used to take care of
certain things personally.

305
01:08:56,842 --> 01:08:59,694
Now, you're keeping
in the background.

306
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:04,324
You'll end up giving orders.

307
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:09,913
It's because, now, I don't want
to leave you alone too much.

308
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:15,377
You're gonna need somebody more and
more every day to stay near you.

309
01:09:16,194 --> 01:09:19,047
- Like a friend.
- Or like a partner.

310
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:20,340
Hmm?

311
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:33,228
How does it feel sitting
behind that desk, Frank?

312
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:39,025
It's almost like holding a gun.

313
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:46,533
Only much more powerful.

314
01:10:01,656 --> 01:10:05,635
You see, staying with you,

315
01:10:07,621 --> 01:10:10,557
I'm beginning to think big, too.

316
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:15,645
This McBain business

317
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,566
has given me ideas.

318
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:29,826
I'm sorry for you, Frank.
You're doing your best.

319
01:10:31,645 --> 01:10:34,289
You'll never succeed
in becoming like me.

320
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,317
Why?

321
01:10:38,318 --> 01:10:44,090
Because there are many things
you'll never understand.

322
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:56,770
This is one of them.

323
01:10:57,629 --> 01:11:01,483
You see, Frank, there are
many kinds of weapons.

324
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:06,404
And the only one that
can stop that is this.

325
01:12:00,734 --> 01:12:03,753
Now, shall we get back
to our little problem?

326
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:09,759
My weapons might look
simple to you, Mr. Morton,

327
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:15,056
but they can still shoot holes big
enough for our little problems.

328
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:19,352
Pretty soon the widow McBain
won't be a problem no more.

329
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:25,024
You wake up one morning and
say, "World, I know you."

330
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:27,885
"From now on, there are
no more surprises."

331
01:12:27,886 --> 01:12:30,763
And then you happen to
meet a man like this,

332
01:12:30,764 --> 01:12:32,448
who looked like a good man.

333
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:35,034
Clear eyes, strong hands.

334
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:37,453
And he wants to marry you.

335
01:12:37,812 --> 01:12:39,706
Which doesn't happen often.

336
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:43,126
And he says he's rich,
too, which doesn't hurt.

337
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:49,257
So you think, "The hell
with New Orleans."

338
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,677
"Now I'll say yes and
go live in the country."

339
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:58,266
"I wouldn't mind giving him
half a dozen kids after all."

340
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,897
"Take care of a house. Do
something. What the hell?"

341
01:13:15,183 --> 01:13:17,785
Well, God rest your
soul, Brett McBain.

342
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:22,665
Even if he's going to have a job
pulling you out of the devil's grip.

343
01:13:37,664 --> 01:13:41,142
Still, I swear he'd left
money around someplace.

344
01:13:42,043 --> 01:13:45,146
If you can find it,
you're welcome to it.

345
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:48,566
Mrs. McBain goes back
to civilization.

346
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:52,070
Minus a husband and
plus a great future.

347
01:13:55,223 --> 01:13:57,659
Hmm.

348
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:07,043
You deserve better.

349
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:13,424
The last man who told me
that is buried out there.

350
01:14:23,001 --> 01:14:25,603
You know, Jill, you
remind me of my mother.

351
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,925
She was the biggest
whore in Alameda

352
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:34,654
and the finest woman
that ever lived.

353
01:14:36,181 --> 01:14:39,826
Whoever my father was,
for an hour or for a month,

354
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,371
he must have been a happy man.

355
01:14:54,199 --> 01:14:56,551
Hey! Hey!

356
01:14:57,911 --> 01:14:59,178
Hey!

357
01:16:04,811 --> 01:16:06,579
What do you want?

358
01:16:07,939 --> 01:16:09,106
Cheyenne's right.

359
01:16:09,107 --> 01:16:13,336
Once you've killed four,
it's easy to make it five.

360
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,811
This isn't the time to leave.

361
01:17:32,065 --> 01:17:33,916
Give me some water.

362
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:45,011
From the well.

363
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,806
I like my water fresh.

364
01:19:16,169 --> 01:19:18,396
When you near a strange
sound, drop to the ground.

365
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:22,108
A sound? Like what?

366
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:24,342
Like that.

367
01:19:56,250 --> 01:20:00,479
He not only plays,
he can shoot, too.

368
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:35,848
Morning, Mrs. McBain.

369
01:20:36,207 --> 01:20:38,851
- What brings you to town?
- Good morning.

370
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:41,962
Maybe you don't remember,
but yesterday at the funeral...

371
01:20:41,963 --> 01:20:44,023
I remember very well.

372
01:20:44,298 --> 01:20:47,276
Is there something
I can do for you?

373
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:49,862
Yes.

374
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:55,517
See Frank. And tell him
I know everything.

375
01:20:55,518 --> 01:20:58,603
Why is everybody hounding
me about this guy Frank?

376
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:01,332
I don't know him.
I've never heard of him.

377
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:05,461
I got my own worries, and all
I want is to be left in peace.

378
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:09,090
Tell Frank I want to negotiate
with him. Personally.

379
01:22:03,753 --> 01:22:07,189
You were told not to come
here for any reason.

380
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:11,301
Whatever business you have with
Frank, keep it far away from here.

381
01:22:11,302 --> 01:22:12,844
Yes, I know, Mr. Morton,

382
01:22:12,845 --> 01:22:14,763
but when I heard that woman
say she knew everything,

383
01:22:14,764 --> 01:22:17,223
I thought that the important thing
was for me to come over here

384
01:22:17,224 --> 01:22:18,645
right away and tell you about it.

385
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:20,661
You never thought
it wasn't a trick?

386
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:23,038
Sure, but you know that I'm
mighty careful, Frank.

387
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:25,374
No one could have followed me.

388
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:28,335
That's the first thing
I learned, working for you.

389
01:22:28,486 --> 01:22:31,046
To listen unseen and
to watch unheard.

390
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:35,217
You should learn to
live as if you didn't exist.

391
01:22:35,826 --> 01:22:37,827
You've known me a long time, Frank.

392
01:22:37,828 --> 01:22:39,746
You know you can trust me.

393
01:22:39,747 --> 01:22:41,599
Wobbles.

394
01:22:46,087 --> 01:22:49,982
How can you trust a man who wears
both a belt and suspenders?

395
01:22:50,758 --> 01:22:53,903
The man can't even
trust his own pants.

396
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:05,164
Let's get out of here.

397
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:46,682
The end of the line.

398
01:24:49,502 --> 01:24:50,686
Yeah.

399
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:58,152
Get him on board.

400
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:14,418
Tie him up.

401
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:49,453
Wait, Frank.

402
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:51,729
I didn't...

403
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:53,624
So, nobody followed you?

404
01:25:54,108 --> 01:25:56,543
No. You gotta believe me.

405
01:25:57,611 --> 01:26:00,047
So, this is the way
I can trust you.

406
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:03,050
I can explain.
I didn't know that he...

407
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:06,637
- Get out.
- No. No. No, Frank.

408
01:26:07,288 --> 01:26:08,913
Get out.

409
01:26:22,887 --> 01:26:23,988
Shh!

410
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:30,077
Frank, wait!

411
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:54,393
I told you to keep quiet.

412
01:26:59,006 --> 01:27:01,567
Where are Logan and Jim?
They take care of the woman?

413
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,610
Someone took care of them.

414
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:06,321
We found them out
at McBain's place.

415
01:27:06,597 --> 01:27:09,116
Stone dead. And the woman was gone.

416
01:27:10,059 --> 01:27:13,245
Your friends have a high
mortality rate, Frank.

417
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:27,342
First three, then two.

418
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:42,232
So you're the one who
makes appointments.

419
01:27:43,884 --> 01:27:47,071
And you're the one who
doesn't keep them.

420
01:27:48,681 --> 01:27:50,449
What do you want?

421
01:27:51,558 --> 01:27:53,077
Who are you?

422
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:57,998
Dave Jenkins.

423
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:08,759
Dave Jenkins is dead
a long time ago.

424
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:11,804
Calder Benson.

425
01:28:13,497 --> 01:28:16,141
What's your name?
Benson's dead, too.

426
01:28:18,168 --> 01:28:20,211
You ought to know, Frank,
better than anyone.

427
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:21,647
You killed him.

428
01:28:22,214 --> 01:28:23,524
Who are you?

429
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:25,984
- Who are you, you...
- Frank!

430
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:29,571
The woman.

431
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:33,659
We're only losing time.

432
01:28:39,023 --> 01:28:40,499
All right.

433
01:28:40,733 --> 01:28:43,752
This time, I'll take
care of her personally.

434
01:28:43,902 --> 01:28:46,421
Yeah, it ought to be easy for you.

435
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:53,327
Keep him warm for me.

436
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:56,014
If he gives you any
trouble, hit him.

437
01:28:56,248 --> 01:29:00,227
Not in the mouth. He's got
to talk. And plenty.

438
01:29:05,758 --> 01:29:07,925
Meet me at the Navajo cliff.

439
01:29:07,926 --> 01:29:10,762
By the way, I want you to keep an
eye on that cripple all the time.

440
01:29:10,763 --> 01:29:12,197
- Understand?
- Sure, Frank.

441
01:30:45,232 --> 01:30:47,459
- See anyone?
- No.

442
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:08,689
There he is.

443
01:33:52,794 --> 01:33:54,980
You only know how to shoot?

444
01:33:56,381 --> 01:33:58,775
Or do you know how to cut, too?

445
01:34:10,145 --> 01:34:11,329
Hey, you.

446
01:34:13,398 --> 01:34:15,333
Wait a minute.

447
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:18,712
Let's have a good look at you.

448
01:34:29,915 --> 01:34:32,767
Hey. Mr. Choo-Choo.

449
01:34:47,349 --> 01:34:49,075
Hmm!

450
01:34:51,353 --> 01:34:53,330
It's easy to find you.

451
01:34:53,855 --> 01:34:54,939
Bastard.

452
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:56,982
I don't have to kill you now.

453
01:34:56,983 --> 01:34:59,878
You leave a slime behind
you like a snail.

454
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:03,465
Two beautiful shiny rails.

455
01:35:04,241 --> 01:35:06,343
There's another bastard.

456
01:35:06,952 --> 01:35:10,222
And he's getting further
away every minute.

457
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:23,134
There it is.

458
01:35:23,135 --> 01:35:24,677
Exactly what your husband
ordered from me.

459
01:35:24,678 --> 01:35:27,263
And seeing as how he paid
cash on the barrelhead,

460
01:35:27,264 --> 01:35:28,907
it all belongs to you.

461
01:35:29,141 --> 01:35:32,244
Oak planks, beech, pine.

462
01:35:32,561 --> 01:35:34,353
All first-grade lumber.

463
01:35:34,354 --> 01:35:37,165
And there's beams and
foundation pylons.

464
01:35:37,357 --> 01:35:41,545
Ten kegs of nails, 20 barrels
of tar, and all these tools.

465
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:43,946
Maybe he wanted to
enlarge the farmhouse.

466
01:35:43,947 --> 01:35:45,924
Enlarge the farmhouse?

467
01:35:46,366 --> 01:35:49,285
He could have built at
least eight of them.

468
01:35:49,286 --> 01:35:51,054
By the way, ma'am,

469
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:54,933
McBain also ordered this.
Said it was important.

470
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:59,229
Only it seems he forgot to tell
me what he wanted printed on it.

471
01:36:06,887 --> 01:36:08,405
<i>Station.</i>

472
01:36:09,973 --> 01:36:11,074
How's that again?

473
01:36:11,475 --> 01:36:13,451
I said print "station."

474
01:36:45,842 --> 01:36:47,569
Looking for this?

475
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:50,971
I've had enough of
your butcher tactics.

476
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:52,991
I know that woman is here.

477
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:56,119
I don't want any more
useless killing.

478
01:36:57,103 --> 01:36:59,522
I'm ready to make a
deal for that land.

479
01:36:59,523 --> 01:37:01,565
To pay what's necessary.

480
01:37:01,566 --> 01:37:04,169
I don't want to waste
any more time.

481
01:37:04,778 --> 01:37:07,339
You've made a big mistake, Morton.

482
01:37:11,493 --> 01:37:15,930
When you're not on that train, you
look like a turtle out of its shell.

483
01:37:16,164 --> 01:37:17,849
Just funny.

484
01:37:18,375 --> 01:37:19,708
Poor cripple talking big

485
01:37:19,709 --> 01:37:22,479
so nobody will know
how scared you are.

486
01:37:22,796 --> 01:37:24,481
I'm here to make a deal, Frank.

487
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:29,194
I don't have time to
compete with you.

488
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:36,910
Compete?

489
01:37:40,897 --> 01:37:42,648
Why, you...

490
01:37:42,649 --> 01:37:46,002
You can't even stand on
your own feet by yourself.

491
01:37:56,621 --> 01:37:59,391
Is that sufficient to
make you feel stronger?

492
01:38:00,125 --> 01:38:02,852
I could squash you
like a wormy apple.

493
01:38:05,213 --> 01:38:08,358
Sure, but you won't do it.

494
01:38:09,301 --> 01:38:12,737
Because it's not to your advantage.

495
01:38:19,769 --> 01:38:23,081
Who knows how far you'd have
gone with two good legs. Huh?

496
01:38:31,072 --> 01:38:34,342
Help him back to the train.
Keep your eye on him.

497
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:40,164
Morton. Don't worry about the land.

498
01:38:40,165 --> 01:38:42,166
If you feel like paying
for it, you can pay.

499
01:38:42,167 --> 01:38:44,084
Of course, it won't make
any difference to you

500
01:38:44,085 --> 01:38:46,271
dealing with the new owner.

501
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:15,508
Cheyenne! Hey, Cheyenne!

502
01:39:16,242 --> 01:39:18,887
There's a square staked out
here. It says "water tank."

503
01:39:19,496 --> 01:39:23,016
Over here, too. Only,
it says "post office."

504
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:25,310
And this one says "corral."

505
01:39:26,211 --> 01:39:28,396
And this here "church."

506
01:39:29,005 --> 01:39:30,857
What the hell is this?

507
01:39:31,216 --> 01:39:32,650
Can't you see?

508
01:39:33,718 --> 01:39:35,361
It's a station.

509
01:39:36,638 --> 01:39:38,782
And all around it, a town.

510
01:39:41,518 --> 01:39:43,369
Brett McBain's town.

511
01:39:45,105 --> 01:39:47,624
Was he crazy!

512
01:39:49,192 --> 01:39:51,586
Yeah, in a very special way.

513
01:39:53,071 --> 01:39:54,547
An Irishman.

514
01:39:56,449 --> 01:39:57,574
He knew, sooner or later,

515
01:39:57,575 --> 01:40:00,953
that rail road coming through
Flagstone would continue on west.

516
01:40:00,954 --> 01:40:03,890
So he looked over all
this country out here

517
01:40:04,874 --> 01:40:07,626
until he found this hunk of desert.

518
01:40:07,627 --> 01:40:09,854
Nobody wanted it.

519
01:40:13,758 --> 01:40:15,151
But he bought it.

520
01:40:17,804 --> 01:40:22,450
Then he tightened his belt,
and for years, he waited.

521
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:25,745
Waited for what?

522
01:40:27,230 --> 01:40:29,791
For the rail road to
reach this point.

523
01:40:30,567 --> 01:40:32,860
Ah, but how in the
hell could he be sure

524
01:40:32,861 --> 01:40:35,880
the rail road would pass
through his property?

525
01:40:37,115 --> 01:40:40,134
Them steam engines can't
roll without water.

526
01:40:40,493 --> 01:40:45,223
And the only water for 50 miles
west of Flagstone is right here.

527
01:40:45,707 --> 01:40:47,958
- Under this land.
- A-ha!

528
01:40:47,959 --> 01:40:50,937
He was no fool, our
dead friend, huh?

529
01:40:51,588 --> 01:40:56,234
He was going to sell this piece of desert
for its weight in gold, wasn't he?

530
01:40:56,718 --> 01:40:59,779
You don't sell the
dream of a lifetime.

531
01:41:01,139 --> 01:41:03,741
Brett McBain wanted his station.

532
01:41:06,269 --> 01:41:08,580
He got the rights to build it.

533
01:41:10,648 --> 01:41:13,484
- How do you know all this?
- I saw a document.

534
01:41:13,485 --> 01:41:16,880
It was all in order. Seals,
signatures, everything.

535
01:41:17,822 --> 01:41:19,323
One thing, though.

536
01:41:19,324 --> 01:41:23,595
In very small print,
there is a short clause,

537
01:41:24,329 --> 01:41:28,165
which says that McBain or
his heirs lose all rights

538
01:41:28,166 --> 01:41:31,394
if, by the time the rail
road reaches this point,

539
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:34,939
the station ain't built yet.

540
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:36,774
Uh-huh!

541
01:41:41,846 --> 01:41:46,034
Speaking of rail roads, I noticed
the rail gang's already...

542
01:41:46,684 --> 01:41:48,328
Hey.

543
01:41:49,521 --> 01:41:53,315
I noticed the rail gang's
already behind those hills.

544
01:41:53,316 --> 01:41:57,837
And before you know it,
they're gonna be here.

545
01:41:58,196 --> 01:41:59,422
Yeah.

546
01:41:59,989 --> 01:42:01,174
Yeah.

547
01:42:02,534 --> 01:42:03,801
Listen.

548
01:42:04,661 --> 01:42:06,095
Harmonica.

549
01:42:07,038 --> 01:42:10,350
A town built around the rail road.

550
01:42:11,501 --> 01:42:13,811
You could make a fortune, huh?

551
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:17,899
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

552
01:42:19,217 --> 01:42:21,069
Hey, more than that.

553
01:42:22,428 --> 01:42:24,447
Thousands of thousands.

554
01:42:25,723 --> 01:42:27,825
They call them millions.

555
01:42:29,519 --> 01:42:31,829
Millions? Hmm.

556
01:42:34,274 --> 01:42:36,733
- Yeah, millions.
- Yeah.

557
01:42:36,734 --> 01:42:41,089
I always thought it'd be easier
to make a deal with a smart lady.

558
01:42:41,656 --> 01:42:43,633
All you gotta do is...

559
01:42:46,286 --> 01:42:49,764
Hey, what in the hell are
you standing around for?

560
01:42:50,081 --> 01:42:52,416
But, chief, what are
we supposed to do?

561
01:42:52,417 --> 01:42:54,585
What are you supposed to do?

562
01:42:54,586 --> 01:42:57,355
Build a station, idiots!

563
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:03,152
I figure it ain't
gonna look like much.

564
01:43:06,097 --> 01:43:10,118
But it'll be the first thing she
sees when she gets back.

565
01:43:11,269 --> 01:43:12,996
If she gets back.

566
01:44:33,059 --> 01:44:34,494
I think...

567
01:44:43,069 --> 01:44:44,295
Yeah.

568
01:44:45,405 --> 01:44:49,634
I'm beginning to think I might
be a little sorry killing you.

569
01:44:52,036 --> 01:44:53,930
You like being alive.

570
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:56,390
Hmm?

571
01:45:07,635 --> 01:45:10,905
You also like to feel a
man's hands all over you.

572
01:45:12,807 --> 01:45:14,325
You like it.

573
01:45:18,646 --> 01:45:22,542
Even if they're the hands of the
man who killed your husband.

574
01:45:42,503 --> 01:45:43,855
What a...

575
01:45:47,383 --> 01:45:49,235
What a little tramp.

576
01:45:52,263 --> 01:45:56,367
Is there anything in the world you
wouldn't do to save your skin?

577
01:45:59,937 --> 01:46:01,581
Nothing, Frank.

578
01:46:23,961 --> 01:46:25,062
Hmm.

579
01:46:25,338 --> 01:46:28,399
Now I understand why
they miss you so much

580
01:46:29,842 --> 01:46:33,821
down there in New Orleans.

581
01:46:36,349 --> 01:46:39,076
Great invention, the telegraph.

582
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:45,333
"Jill? The brunette?"

583
01:46:45,942 --> 01:46:47,651
"My God, all the customers"

584
01:46:47,652 --> 01:46:50,320
"of the most elegant
whorehouse on Bourbon Street"

585
01:46:50,321 --> 01:46:53,424
"have been weeping
ever since she left."

586
01:46:55,785 --> 01:46:57,345
Say, tell me.

587
01:46:58,746 --> 01:47:00,598
Did old McBain know?

588
01:47:01,415 --> 01:47:02,600
Yeah.

589
01:47:04,001 --> 01:47:05,853
Yeah, I bet he did.

590
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:09,106
He was just the type
to marry a whore.

591
01:47:12,343 --> 01:47:13,527
Hey.

592
01:47:15,179 --> 01:47:16,739
It's an idea.

593
01:47:19,058 --> 01:47:20,826
I could marry you.

594
01:47:22,186 --> 01:47:24,580
And the land would become mine.

595
01:47:25,314 --> 01:47:26,666
And maybe

596
01:47:29,443 --> 01:47:31,587
you'd make a perfect wife.

597
01:47:35,867 --> 01:47:39,679
It would be me who wouldn't
be any good as a husband.

598
01:47:40,955 --> 01:47:42,306
Too bad.

599
01:47:43,207 --> 01:47:46,018
We'll have to think
of another solution.

600
01:47:46,335 --> 01:47:47,979
Simpler.

601
01:47:53,217 --> 01:47:54,568
Quicker.

602
01:48:16,616 --> 01:48:18,867
As sheriff of this county,

603
01:48:18,868 --> 01:48:22,370
I've been asked to preside
over the sale by auction

604
01:48:22,371 --> 01:48:27,018
of all property belonging to
Mrs. Jill McBain, here present.

605
01:48:27,376 --> 01:48:30,921
This parcel of land
measures 320 acres.

606
01:48:30,922 --> 01:48:35,276
It's free of all encumbrances,
liens and mortgages.

607
01:48:36,219 --> 01:48:38,428
This property and all it contains,

608
01:48:38,429 --> 01:48:40,764
lock, stock and barrel,

609
01:48:40,765 --> 01:48:44,392
will be turned over to the lucky
purchaser at the time of sale.

610
01:48:44,393 --> 01:48:47,229
All the contents therein
are listed by number

611
01:48:47,230 --> 01:48:50,232
on the inventory sheet
distributed among you.

612
01:48:50,233 --> 01:48:54,236
The entire property will be sold
in block to the highest bidder.

613
01:48:54,237 --> 01:48:55,880
All right. That's
clear to everybody.

614
01:48:57,698 --> 01:48:59,467
I declare the auction open.

615
01:48:59,867 --> 01:49:02,595
Now, who's going to
make the first bid?

616
01:49:07,124 --> 01:49:11,354
A list of all the items. Some
of them are worth money.

617
01:49:12,338 --> 01:49:16,067
All right. Now, who's going
to make the first bid?

618
01:49:19,929 --> 01:49:21,572
$200.

619
01:49:22,473 --> 01:49:25,076
Well, I have
an opening bid of $200.

620
01:49:25,434 --> 01:49:28,979
$200. Do I hear more?

621
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:31,815
That stinking piece of
land ain't worth it.

622
01:49:31,816 --> 01:49:33,024
Is it, old-timer?

623
01:49:33,025 --> 01:49:36,170
Come on, my friends, $200.

624
01:49:36,612 --> 01:49:39,632
The livestock alone is
worth twice that much.

625
01:49:41,158 --> 01:49:42,426
Well...

626
01:49:43,536 --> 01:49:45,930
Who's going to bid $300?

627
01:49:49,875 --> 01:49:51,668
Now, look, friends,

628
01:49:51,669 --> 01:49:54,921
I realize we're not
offering California here,

629
01:49:54,922 --> 01:49:58,258
but 200 is damn little
for all that property.

630
01:49:58,259 --> 01:50:02,446
Ladies and gentlemen, I wouldn't
even take 200 as a deposit.

631
01:50:05,683 --> 01:50:09,203
Well, nobody's going to bid it up.

632
01:50:17,445 --> 01:50:20,589
You're sure you wouldn't
want to set a minimum price?

633
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:25,076
I wish I were wrong, Mrs. McBain,

634
01:50:25,077 --> 01:50:28,139
but you're liable to end up selling
the place for a plate of beans.

635
01:50:35,463 --> 01:50:37,606
All I want is to sell.

636
01:51:44,407 --> 01:51:47,259
- You look fat, huh?
- If you say so.

637
01:51:48,327 --> 01:51:50,221
- How many?
- One card.

638
01:51:52,665 --> 01:51:54,141
One for me.

639
01:51:56,961 --> 01:51:58,812
Dealer takes three.

640
01:52:09,306 --> 01:52:11,700
Can I... Can I take a hand?

641
01:52:18,149 --> 01:52:19,500
Fifteen.

642
01:52:32,788 --> 01:52:34,848
Yeah, sit down.

643
01:52:58,439 --> 01:52:59,873
I'll deal.

644
01:54:44,962 --> 01:54:46,522
How do you...

645
01:54:47,798 --> 01:54:50,609
How do you play this
game, Mr. Morton?

646
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:54,947
It's very simple.

647
01:54:56,181 --> 01:55:00,828
As long as you use your
head, you never lose.

648
01:55:01,604 --> 01:55:03,247
$500.

649
01:55:08,777 --> 01:55:10,295
$500.

650
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:12,363
Mmm-hmm.

651
01:55:12,364 --> 01:55:14,466
Do I hear any other bids?

652
01:55:16,785 --> 01:55:18,512
I don't think so.

653
01:55:27,755 --> 01:55:29,213
I'm sorry, Mrs. McBain,

654
01:55:29,214 --> 01:55:34,278
but I think I'm gonna have to
knock down on that last bid.

655
01:55:45,230 --> 01:55:46,999
$500 once.

656
01:55:50,152 --> 01:55:52,463
$500 twice.

657
01:55:55,366 --> 01:55:57,926
- $500...
- $5,000.

658
01:56:21,725 --> 01:56:26,121
- You said $5,000?
- It's on its way.

659
01:56:38,992 --> 01:56:40,928
It's Cheyenne!

660
01:56:50,587 --> 01:56:53,774
The reward for this man
is $5,000, that right?

661
01:56:54,091 --> 01:56:58,237
Judas was content with $4,970 less.

662
01:56:58,762 --> 01:57:01,365
There were no dollars in them days.

663
01:57:03,434 --> 01:57:05,869
But sons of bitches, yeah.

664
01:57:19,241 --> 01:57:21,844
Hey, wait a minute.

665
01:57:24,079 --> 01:57:27,015
- The jail's that way.
- Yeah, I know.

666
01:57:27,291 --> 01:57:30,811
Yeah, but you're going to
the rail road station.

667
01:57:31,712 --> 01:57:34,380
I'm sending you to Yuma, Cheyenne.

668
01:57:34,381 --> 01:57:36,525
They got a modern jail there.

669
01:57:36,759 --> 01:57:41,238
It's got more walls,
more bars, more guards.

670
01:57:41,972 --> 01:57:45,909
Oh, you'll like it,
in 20 years. You'll see.

671
01:58:47,204 --> 01:58:50,581
Two tickets, amigo,
to the next station.

672
01:58:50,582 --> 01:58:52,142
One way only.

673
01:58:53,085 --> 01:58:54,186
Mmm-hmm.

674
01:58:54,837 --> 01:58:57,773
Here's to you. And congratulations.

675
01:59:02,553 --> 01:59:04,863
You got yourself a good deal.

676
01:59:06,223 --> 01:59:07,699
Oh, the auction.

677
01:59:08,725 --> 01:59:12,245
Forget it. I don't invest in land.

678
01:59:14,773 --> 01:59:19,336
You don't look at all like the noble
defender of poor defenseless widows.

679
01:59:21,238 --> 01:59:22,839
But then again,

680
01:59:25,617 --> 01:59:28,845
I don't look like a
poor defenseless widow.

681
01:59:35,586 --> 01:59:37,896
Cheyenne's right. You're
a remarkable woman.

682
01:59:39,798 --> 01:59:41,984
And you're a remarkable man.

683
01:59:42,718 --> 01:59:45,362
But you have something
on your mind.

684
01:59:51,018 --> 01:59:53,245
And you got something on your mind.

685
01:59:56,815 --> 02:00:00,877
Hot water. A bathtub
full of hot water.

686
02:00:19,504 --> 02:00:22,315
I think it's time
I filled that bathtub.

687
02:00:53,163 --> 02:00:54,473
Who are you?

688
02:01:15,978 --> 02:01:17,454
Jim Cooper.

689
02:01:18,355 --> 02:01:20,123
Chuck Youngblood.

690
02:01:21,024 --> 02:01:22,626
More dead men.

691
02:01:26,363 --> 02:01:29,466
They were all alive until
they met you, Frank.

692
02:01:35,622 --> 02:01:38,892
You paid $5,000 for something
that belongs to me.

693
02:01:44,006 --> 02:01:45,273
5,000.

694
02:01:50,303 --> 02:01:52,322
Plus one.

695
02:01:57,769 --> 02:02:00,080
You've got a right to
make a profit, too.

696
02:02:27,090 --> 02:02:30,277
I wouldn't take too long thinking
about it, if I were you.

697
02:02:35,057 --> 02:02:37,433
You got yourself into something
that's bigger than you are.

698
02:02:37,434 --> 02:02:40,203
You got a chance to get
out easy. You better take it.

699
02:02:40,562 --> 02:02:43,373
You sound like a real
businessman, Frank.

700
02:02:44,107 --> 02:02:47,419
Being with Mr. Morton has
done you a lot of good.

701
02:02:54,868 --> 02:02:56,928
And you've learned
some new methods.

702
02:02:59,164 --> 02:03:02,184
Yeah, Mr. Morton has shown
you a lot of new ways.

703
02:03:06,838 --> 02:03:09,566
Even though you haven't
given up the old ones.

704
02:03:10,717 --> 02:03:13,737
Pick any method you like.
Just make the deal.

705
02:03:16,431 --> 02:03:18,200
Which deal, Frank?

706
02:03:21,228 --> 02:03:23,163
We have more than one, you and me.

707
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:32,505
We can lump them together into
one bundle, settle all of them.

708
02:03:33,031 --> 02:03:34,591
Here and now.

709
02:03:36,743 --> 02:03:38,595
Easy, Frank.

710
02:03:39,162 --> 02:03:40,388
Easy.

711
02:03:41,456 --> 02:03:43,725
You gotta learn not to push things.

712
02:03:43,875 --> 02:03:46,937
Taking it easy is the first
thing a businessman should do.

713
02:03:50,173 --> 02:03:53,944
I got an idea Mr. Morton
can teach you a lot more.

714
02:03:57,848 --> 02:03:59,241
How much?

715
02:04:00,517 --> 02:04:01,952
$1.

716
02:05:06,958 --> 02:05:08,685
Giddy up!

717
02:06:42,929 --> 02:06:44,447
Giddy up!

718
02:07:48,536 --> 02:07:51,288
I could swear we're going
to have that strange sound.

719
02:07:51,289 --> 02:07:52,724
Right now.

720
02:09:45,570 --> 02:09:47,088
Time sure flies.

721
02:09:48,781 --> 02:09:50,675
It's already past 12:00.

722
02:10:50,218 --> 02:10:52,678
But... But they were his men.

723
02:10:52,679 --> 02:10:55,198
- Yeah.
- And they tried to kill him.

724
02:10:55,557 --> 02:10:57,516
They must have found
somebody who pays better.

725
02:10:57,517 --> 02:10:58,660
And you!

726
02:10:58,977 --> 02:11:00,953
You saved his life.

727
02:11:03,481 --> 02:11:06,709
I didn't let them kill him and
that's not the same thing.

728
02:11:19,455 --> 02:11:20,973
Sure.

729
02:11:21,457 --> 02:11:24,018
It's not the same thing.

730
02:11:31,259 --> 02:11:32,944
You get dressed.

731
02:11:33,261 --> 02:11:34,779
It's time to go home.

732
02:16:54,290 --> 02:16:56,142
Did you make coffee?

733
02:16:57,585 --> 02:16:59,270
This time I did.

734
02:17:39,669 --> 02:17:40,853
Good.

735
02:17:43,381 --> 02:17:46,609
My mother used to
make coffee this way.

736
02:17:47,343 --> 02:17:52,114
Hot, strong and good.

737
02:18:01,524 --> 02:18:03,292
- Cheyenne.
- Huh?

738
02:18:05,403 --> 02:18:07,838
What's he waiting for out there?

739
02:18:10,366 --> 02:18:11,592
What's he doing?

740
02:18:17,498 --> 02:18:20,017
He's whittling on a piece of wood.

741
02:18:22,461 --> 02:18:25,272
I got a feeling when
he stops whittling,

742
02:18:26,632 --> 02:18:28,734
something's gonna happen.

743
02:19:37,203 --> 02:19:39,305
Surprised to see me here?

744
02:19:41,332 --> 02:19:43,100
I knew you'd come.

745
02:20:06,690 --> 02:20:09,793
Morton once told me
I could never be like him.

746
02:20:11,028 --> 02:20:12,921
Now I understand why.

747
02:20:15,157 --> 02:20:19,595
Wouldn't have bothered him, knowing
you were around somewhere alive.

748
02:20:20,663 --> 02:20:24,099
So you found out you're not
a businessman after all?

749
02:20:24,542 --> 02:20:25,809
Just a man.

750
02:20:28,379 --> 02:20:30,105
An ancient race.

751
02:20:36,387 --> 02:20:40,783
Other Mortons will be along
and they'll kill it off.

752
02:20:41,058 --> 02:20:43,118
The future don't matter to us.

753
02:20:43,894 --> 02:20:45,186
Nothing matters now.

754
02:20:45,187 --> 02:20:48,624
Not the land, not the
money, not the woman.

755
02:20:49,149 --> 02:20:51,126
I came here to see you.

756
02:20:53,612 --> 02:20:56,799
'Cause I know that now you'll
tell me what you're after.

757
02:21:12,006 --> 02:21:14,191
Only at the point of dying.

758
02:21:17,428 --> 02:21:18,737
I know.

759
02:22:03,307 --> 02:22:07,119
I heated some water for you.
I also found a razor.

760
02:22:07,978 --> 02:22:10,205
Put it there, please.

761
02:22:12,524 --> 02:22:16,336
So I can watch the rail
road move up while I shave.

762
02:22:22,743 --> 02:22:24,219
You know what?

763
02:22:25,913 --> 02:22:28,682
If I was you, I'd go down there
and give those boys a drink.

764
02:22:38,217 --> 02:22:39,943
You can't imagine

765
02:22:41,136 --> 02:22:44,406
how happy it makes a man
to see a woman like you.

766
02:22:46,767 --> 02:22:48,619
Just to look at her.

767
02:22:52,231 --> 02:22:55,584
And if one of them
should pat your behind,

768
02:22:57,528 --> 02:23:00,255
just make believe it's nothing.

769
02:23:03,117 --> 02:23:04,760
They earned it.

770
02:27:38,934 --> 02:27:41,369
Keep your loving brother happy.

771
02:31:00,218 --> 02:31:02,737
Who... Who are you?

772
02:32:10,413 --> 02:32:14,351
Hey. You're sort of a handsome man.

773
02:32:17,379 --> 02:32:19,522
But I'm not the right man.

774
02:32:32,310 --> 02:32:34,079
And neither is he.

775
02:32:36,815 --> 02:32:38,249
Maybe not.

776
02:32:38,733 --> 02:32:40,335
But it doesn't matter.

777
02:32:44,614 --> 02:32:46,841
You don't understand, Jill.

778
02:32:48,285 --> 02:32:51,346
People like that have
something inside.

779
02:32:53,581 --> 02:32:55,975
Something to do with death.

780
02:32:59,254 --> 02:33:03,525
If that fella lives, he'll
come in through that door,

781
02:33:04,301 --> 02:33:06,694
pick up his gear and say <i>adiós.</i>

782
02:33:12,350 --> 02:33:15,078
It would be nice to
see this town grow.

783
02:34:47,028 --> 02:34:48,463
Now I gotta go.

784
02:35:34,659 --> 02:35:38,346
Gonna be a beautiful
town, Sweetwater.

785
02:35:42,917 --> 02:35:45,353
I hope you'll come back someday.

786
02:36:03,021 --> 02:36:04,372
Someday.

787
02:36:16,659 --> 02:36:20,638
Yeah. I gotta go, too.

788
02:36:46,481 --> 02:36:48,625
Make believe it's nothing.

789
02:38:54,108 --> 02:38:55,877
Sorry, Harmonica.

790
02:38:56,319 --> 02:38:58,421
I gotta stay here.

791
02:39:36,901 --> 02:39:38,085
Who?

792
02:39:41,698 --> 02:39:43,800
I ran into Mr. Choo-Choo.

793
02:39:44,742 --> 02:39:48,262
I didn't count on that
half-man from the train.

794
02:39:48,996 --> 02:39:51,123
He got scared.

795
02:40:09,475 --> 02:40:11,118
Hey, Harmonica.

796
02:40:12,520 --> 02:40:14,372
When they do you in,

797
02:40:15,022 --> 02:40:17,625
pray it's somebody who
knows where to shoot.

798
02:40:33,374 --> 02:40:34,600
Go away.

799
02:40:37,545 --> 02:40:38,896
Go away.

800
02:40:39,505 --> 02:40:42,650
Go away. I don't want
you to see me die.
