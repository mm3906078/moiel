17
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:15,446
During the Civil Wars,

18
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:20,285
an endless cycle of conflict
left the countryside overrun by bandits.

19
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:24,581
Peaceable folk lived in terror
of the thunder of approaching hooves...

20
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:11,711
Take this village too?

21
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:14,589
Take it! Take it!

22
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:16,925
Not so fast!

23
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:21,095
We just took their rice last fall.

24
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,181
They'll have nothing now.

25
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,141
Very well.

26
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:28,144
We'll return
when that barley's ripe!

27
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:03,471
Is there no god to protect us?

28
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:10,853
Land tax, forced labor,
war, drought...

29
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:14,232
and now bandits!

30
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:22,323
The gods want us farmers dead!

31
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,243
That's right!
We're better off dead!

32
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:31,165
What's all this?
Crying won't change anything.

33
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:34,502
The magistrate can do more
than collect taxes.

34
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:36,504
We can ask him for help.

35
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:39,507
We know all about him!

36
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:43,011
He shows up after they're gone,
acting big while he surveys the damage.

37
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,346
That's right. He's useless.

38
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:50,810
We might as well hand over
our rice and barley to the bandits

39
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:53,271
and just hang ourselves!

40
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:57,191
That'll bring the magistrate
here in a hurry!

41
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:09,495
We'll kill those bandits.

42
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:12,540
We'll kill them all.

43
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:14,751
Never again!
Let's kill 'em all!

44
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,045
Not me!

45
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:20,882
I couldn't possibly —

46
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:24,969
That's crazy talk.

47
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:30,224
So we can kill defeated samurai
but not bandits?

48
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:34,187
Stop it! This is no time
to fight amongst ourselves.

49
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:41,360
We don't have a chance against bandits.
And when we lose?

50
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:44,906
They'll slaughter us all,
down to the last unborn child.

51
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:48,534
I've had enough!
Better to risk it all

52
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:51,412
than to live like this.
Kill or be killed!

53
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:53,039
Rikichi!

54
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:56,250
The farmer's only choice
is to endure.

55
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:58,544
We can't defy the powerful.

56
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:03,091
When the bandits arrive,
we'll greet them meekly

57
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:06,094
and quietly hand over
all our barley.

58
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:11,140
We'll plead with them to leave
just enough for us to survive.

59
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,771
"That's all we ask,"
we'll beg on our hands and knees.

60
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:20,650
What bandit will agree to that?

61
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:26,197
Have you forgotten how low we had
to stoop for the rice we're eating now?

62
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,720
We should go see the Old Man.

63
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,306
Let him decide what to do.

64
00:08:57,872 --> 00:09:00,082
<i>Consider who
we're dealing with here.</i>

65
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:05,713
<i>Give a wolf a taste of your leg
and he'll ask for your hand.</i>

66
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,716
<i>Once they have a taste,
they'll be back in the fall.</i>

67
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:12,178
<i>- But what if we lose?
- Then we're no worse off!</i>

68
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,723
<i>Without our barley,
we're doomed anyway!</i>

69
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,104
We fight.

70
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:26,067
Old Man, that's madness.

71
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:28,694
We're farmers.
What do we know of battle?

72
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:31,405
We'll hire samurai.

73
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:35,910
Whoever heard of farmers
hiring samurai?

74
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:40,248
I saw it with my own eyes,

75
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:46,504
when the village you were born in
was torched.

76
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:51,717
I saw it when we escaped
to this village here.

77
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:59,809
The only village that didn't burn
was the one that hired samurai.

78
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:03,813
But Old Man, there are
different kinds of villages and villagers.

79
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,524
How are we to feed samurai
when we live on rice gruel?

80
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:07,942
We'll make do on millet!

81
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:12,446
Show me a samurai who'll fight
for farmers in return for food!

82
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,615
They're a proud lot.

83
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:15,866
Look.

84
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:20,788
Find hungry samurai.

85
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:27,795
Even bears come down from
the mountains when they're hungry.

86
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:14,050
How dare you?

87
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:18,971
You're nothing but a farmer!
I'm still a samurai!

88
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:20,973
I don't need your charity!

89
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:25,686
Fool!

90
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:34,612
What'd I tell you?

91
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:09,647
Look, the barley's ripe.

92
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,817
Ten days already
since we left the village.

93
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:15,403
What do we do?

94
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,950
This barley's early,
not like our mountain barley.

95
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:27,373
Hey, we're soaked through
to the bone.

96
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,252
Find any cheap, strong
and foolhardy samurai?

97
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,251
Leftovers.

98
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:13,878
You can have 'em cheap.

99
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:15,337
That's a laugh!

100
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:18,966
- What's so funny?
- He's blind.

101
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:22,845
- What about you, then?
- Not me.

102
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:25,389
I'd rather eat horseshit.

103
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:33,939
- Won't get a nose bleed outta him.
- Cleaned him out gambling last night.

104
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:37,985
Pulled his sword when he lost,
so the three of us beat him up.

105
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:40,571
Not a drop left in his nose now.

106
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,912
Don't bother.
They only eat millet.

107
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:51,165
Is that true?
You can't live like that.

108
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:54,293
Without nourishment
you'll go night-blind.

109
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:56,378
I've got just four left.

110
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:59,215
I'll trade 'em all
for a cup of rice.

111
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:01,383
What do you say?

112
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:06,764
Damn! What a bunch.

113
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:28,035
What a waste.

114
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:33,207
If we still had that rice,
we coulda bought 40 of those.

115
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:34,374
Shut up!

116
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:37,336
But it's true, right?

117
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:41,423
The blockhead's cracking up!

118
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:44,385
What a show.
Go at it, boys.

119
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:53,936
Who ever heard
of anything so unfair?

120
00:14:55,479 --> 00:15:01,360
We give him his fill of rice
and a free bottle of sake,

121
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:05,531
and he thanks us
with a beating.

122
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:09,076
Good for him!

123
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,246
Not like this one
playing possum here.

124
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:17,751
Say, let's go home.
Let's just go home.

125
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,297
Look at him sobbing.

126
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:23,173
Misses his wifey.

127
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,427
I'd pay good money
to watch the two of 'em going at it.

128
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:31,223
Let's hurry
and get back to the village.

129
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,893
Go on home. You can't afford buns,
let alone samurai.

130
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:39,940
Farmers like us know
good from bad when it comes to seed,

131
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,943
but not when it comes
to samurai.

132
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,949
Besides, we're no match
for the tough ones,

133
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:55,623
and the only ones interested
are weaklings.

134
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:08,469
If I lost last night,
it was only because I was starving.

135
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:13,432
Liar! You had plenty
of money to gamble.

136
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,809
Jerk!

137
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,519
Wanna fight?

138
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,689
It's a fight.

139
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:26,487
Over here!
Wake up!

140
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:39,667
Quit that strumming, monk!
It's depressing!

141
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:43,671
Keep it up, grandpa.
We're on your side.

142
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:16,328
Rikichi!

143
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,747
Stop it, Manzo!

144
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:22,209
You said we were going home,
you son of a bitch!

145
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:26,088
I said we'd go home,
not bargain with bandits!

146
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,425
If we can't hire samurai,
what's left?

147
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:32,261
It's bargain or nothing!

148
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:35,848
Fine, have it your way!

149
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:46,024
But tell me:

150
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:49,278
If we do strike a bargain,

151
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:51,739
what have we got
to offer this year?

152
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,742
Are you willing to give 'em
your daughter?

153
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,620
Shino's a fine-lookin' girl.

154
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,339
What's going on?

155
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:37,469
There's a thief in that barn.
We raised a ruckus and he ran in to hide.

156
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,994
How many thieves are there?

157
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,245
Just one.

158
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:05,122
One?

159
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:09,376
All of you can't take
a single thief?

160
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:14,423
We don't dare make a move.
He took a kid in there with him.

161
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,384
Says he'll kill him
if we attack.

162
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:21,138
Listen. Hear him?

163
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,604
Poor thing.

164
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,939
It all happened
in the middle of the night.

165
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:35,402
Poor kid's been bawling
the better part of a day.

166
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,739
He can barely
make a sound now.

167
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:46,079
He's only seven.
Imagine how his parents feel.

168
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:50,000
Who's that samurai
getting his head shaved?

169
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:54,546
No idea. We asked him for help
and he agreed right away.

170
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:56,757
Then he asked us
for two rice balls.

171
00:20:56,924 --> 00:21:01,136
He asked a monk to shave his head
and lend him his robes.

172
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:02,888
No idea what he's up to.

173
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:39,651
<i>Stay back!
Any closer and I kill the brat!</i>

174
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:41,778
I'm a monk.

175
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:44,114
<i>Stay back!</i>

176
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:49,536
I'm just a monk.
I mean you no harm.

177
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,293
I won't come in.

178
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,589
I just thought the child
must be very hungry.

179
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,221
I've brought some rice balls.

180
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,224
You should eat one yourself.

181
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:17,272
Won't you have one?

182
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:18,647
What's wrong?

183
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:24,529
<i>Throw 'em here!</i>

184
00:23:25,197 --> 00:23:26,364
Here.

185
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,311
My baby!

186
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,510
Even you can't object
to a samurai like that.

187
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:13,513
Ask him quickly.
It'll be harder in town.

188
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:31,615
What do you want?

189
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:44,336
My name is Katsushiro Okamoto.
Please make me your disciple!

190
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:48,381
Disciple?

191
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:52,385
As you see, I'm a ronin.
The name is Kambei Shimada.

192
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:55,263
I don't take on disciples.

193
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,141
Get up.
I can't talk to you like this.

194
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:01,561
I'm begging you —
let me be your disciple.

195
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:06,608
First get off your knees.
We'll talk as we go.

196
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:20,664
I'm at a loss.

197
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,917
You think far too highly of me.

198
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:24,834
No, sir —

199
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:26,753
Just hear me out.

200
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,090
There's nothing special
about me.

201
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:33,551
I may have seen
my share of battle,

202
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:36,721
but always on the losing side.

203
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:39,683
That about sums me up.

204
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,936
Better not to follow
such an unlucky man.

205
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:48,108
No, I'm determined to follow you
whether you allow me to or not.

206
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:49,901
I forbid it.

207
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:53,947
I don't have the means
to travel with an attendant.

208
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:07,919
Can I help you?

209
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:17,846
What do you want?

210
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:27,063
Insolence!

211
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:31,026
Stay out of this, little chick.

212
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:36,156
Are you a samurai?

213
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:41,995
Damn right I am!

214
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:46,750
I wonder.

215
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:55,967
Bastard.

216
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:13,860
Who was that?

217
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:21,785
Leave him be.

218
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:41,971
I beg of you, sir!

219
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:47,018
You idiot.
Why don't you scram?

220
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:53,149
Stubborn old fool.
They'll eat it and run like last time.

221
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:00,615
It will never work.

222
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:04,285
Sir, we could arm the villagers
with bamboo spears.

223
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:07,080
- I thought of that.
- But, sir —

224
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,169
This isn't a game.

225
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:19,259
They may be bandits,
but they ride 40 strong.

226
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:23,096
Two or three samurai
won't suffice.

227
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:39,946
Defense is more difficult
than offense.

228
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:44,200
You say there are mountains
behind the village?

229
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:45,201
Yes.

230
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:47,120
Passable by horse?

231
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:48,288
Yes.

232
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:59,757
Fields in front.

233
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:02,469
Until those are flooded
with water,

234
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:05,847
you're open to mounted attack
on four sides.

235
00:30:07,265 --> 00:30:10,018
You need at least four men,
one to guard each side.

236
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:14,147
Two more to guard the rear.

237
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:18,485
No matter how frugal
our estimate,

238
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,696
we need seven,
including me.

239
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:26,201
We can manage
seven somehow.

240
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:29,120
But the Old Man said four.

241
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:30,997
It's only three more.

242
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:33,041
Hold on a second.

243
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:36,961
I haven't accepted your offer.
I'm only speculating.

244
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:42,842
First of all, it's not easy
to find trustworthy samurai.

245
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:48,223
What's more,
all you have to offer is food.

246
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:53,019
Only those out to fight
for the hell of it will agree.

247
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:57,732
Besides, I'm sick of fighting.

248
00:30:59,192 --> 00:31:00,860
Age, I suppose.

249
00:31:22,215 --> 00:31:25,301
Good thing
I wasn't born a peasant.

250
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:30,557
Better to be born a dog.
Goddamn it.

251
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:34,811
Go ahead — hang yourself and die!
You're better off dead!

252
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:36,396
Silence, you lout!

253
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:39,190
What's it to you?
I'm only telling the truth.

254
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:43,653
What truth? What the hell do you know
of these farmers' suffering?

255
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,446
Don't make me laugh!

256
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:47,323
Like you would know.

257
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,490
How dare you?

258
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:51,953
You heard right. If you know,
why don't you help them?

259
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:59,085
So you wanna fight?

260
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:02,880
That's enough.

261
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:11,055
Enough!

262
00:32:18,354 --> 00:32:21,649
Hey, samurai, look at this.

263
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:23,693
This here's your dinner.

264
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,529
But what do you think
these blockheads eat?

265
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:27,989
Millet.

266
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:32,285
They eat millet
to feed you white rice.

267
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:35,955
This is the best they can offer.
What do you say to that?

268
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:39,667
- All right, then.
- What?

269
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:41,294
Quit your jabbering.

270
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:49,385
I won't let this rice go to waste.

271
00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:08,446
Manzo and the others are back!

272
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:24,629
Where are Rikichi and Yohei?

273
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:27,507
They stayed behind.
We still need more samurai.

274
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:29,008
The samurai are coming?

275
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:31,219
They sure are.
Seven of 'em.

276
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:32,637
Seven?

277
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:38,184
Seven.

278
00:33:38,768 --> 00:33:42,980
I was against it
because you said four, Old Man.

279
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:49,862
I figured we'd need
at least ten.

280
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:55,118
But if I'd said ten,
we'd have ended up with 15.

281
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:58,705
That's the way it goes.

282
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:03,209
Old Man, I'm worried.

283
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,509
The village girls will go crazy
over the samurai.

284
00:34:11,676 --> 00:34:15,888
If the samurai touch 'em,
all hell will break loose.

285
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:22,395
Bandits are coming, you fool.

286
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:26,023
Your head is on the block,

287
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,652
and all you think of
are your whiskers?

288
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:40,455
Samurai, sir.

289
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:54,927
- You require my services?
- Yes, sir.

290
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,138
Who's to be my opponent?

291
00:34:58,306 --> 00:35:00,057
<i>Katsushiro.</i>

292
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:13,905
Hide just inside the door.

293
00:35:16,574 --> 00:35:18,826
Strike that ronin as he enters.

294
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:25,333
Here he comes.

295
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:33,174
Don't hold back.
Give him a real whack.

296
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:03,788
Excellent!

297
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:08,835
Please don't take offense.
I am Kambei Shimada.

298
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:13,464
We're seeking expert swordsmen
and have no time to waste.

299
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:14,966
Forgive me.

300
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:16,884
What's this about?

301
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,887
The reason better be good,
or I'll have to redeem my honor.

302
00:36:20,054 --> 00:36:24,559
I humbly beg your pardon.
We only sought to test your skill.

303
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:28,062
We must soon contend
with a gang of bandits.

304
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:31,899
I see.
And whose clan do you serve?

305
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:37,488
It pains me to tell you,
but we're fighting for farmers.

306
00:36:37,655 --> 00:36:39,198
- Farmers?
- That's right.

307
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:42,827
This job affords
no stipend and no reward.

308
00:36:43,536 --> 00:36:47,081
But we can eat our fill
as long as we fight.

309
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:48,749
This is absurd!

310
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:51,878
My ambitions
are greater than that.

311
00:36:53,504 --> 00:36:57,842
That's a shame.
Won't you reconsider?

312
00:36:58,718 --> 00:37:00,094
I will not.

313
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:11,480
Sir, we lost a good man there.
Such a fine swordsman.

314
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,236
What's wrong?

315
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:03,824
That one samurai's good,
but how'll the other six be?

316
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:06,118
Enough of your worrying.

317
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:10,915
How can we know before they get here?
Don't worry till you've seen 'em.

318
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:28,140
<i>That one there.</i>

319
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:48,828
Excuse me, samurai, sir.

320
00:38:50,997 --> 00:38:52,873
Just like last time?

321
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:59,296
Sure.
It's good practice for you.

322
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,372
Surely you jest.

323
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:36,000
No offense intended.

324
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:52,767
I'm with you.

325
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:57,438
But I have to say

326
00:39:57,938 --> 00:40:00,733
that although I understand
the farmers' suffering

327
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:05,571
and understand
why you would take up their cause,

328
00:40:05,738 --> 00:40:10,659
it's your character
that I find most compelling.

329
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:16,207
In life one finds friends
in the strangest places.

330
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:24,799
- What is your name?
- Gorobei Katayama.

331
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:26,967
A name fit for a giant, no?

332
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:41,440
Yohei, what are you doing?
Hurry and wash the rice.

333
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,446
Yohei!

334
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:52,493
What's wrong?

335
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:57,289
Someone stole the rice.

336
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:11,595
You idiot!
Didn't I warn you?

337
00:41:11,762 --> 00:41:14,557
I was so careful.

338
00:41:19,228 --> 00:41:23,774
I slept the whole night
hugging that rice jar.

339
00:41:28,863 --> 00:41:30,865
Fine, then!
I'll get more from home!

340
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:33,659
But what'll we do

341
00:41:33,826 --> 00:41:36,078
till you get back?

342
00:41:36,245 --> 00:41:40,541
There's only a handful left.

343
00:42:33,135 --> 00:42:34,887
Stop that, you idiot!

344
00:42:35,054 --> 00:42:37,848
Hide that money.
The master's returning.

345
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:46,065
I ran into you
at just the right time.

346
00:42:48,901 --> 00:42:54,990
So you're still alive.
I figured you'd long since left this earth.

347
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:04,333
Now tell me,
what happened after that?

348
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:08,087
I hid among the grasses
in the moat until dark.

349
00:43:10,506 --> 00:43:16,387
When the outer walls tumbled down
on me in flames, I knew I was finished.

350
00:43:17,388 --> 00:43:19,848
What ran through your mind
at that moment?

351
00:43:20,724 --> 00:43:23,727
Nothing special.

352
00:43:26,105 --> 00:43:28,857
Sick of fighting yet?

353
00:43:37,658 --> 00:43:43,956
Truth is, there's a tough battle ahead
leading to neither money nor rank.

354
00:43:44,123 --> 00:43:46,500
Will you join us?
- Yes.

355
00:43:47,293 --> 00:43:49,545
This may be the one
that kills us.

356
00:44:10,566 --> 00:44:12,443
Where are they
when you need 'em?

357
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:14,737
What do you need, sir?

358
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:17,156
Samurai.

359
00:44:19,116 --> 00:44:23,329
There's a pretty poor excuse for one
in my backyard.

360
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:27,166
I couldn't believe his gumption.

361
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:30,085
He says,
"I'm hungry. Feed me.

362
00:44:30,252 --> 00:44:34,340
I'm broke, though,
so I'll pay you by chopping wood."

363
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,098
I like his frankness.

364
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:25,724
Never seen a man
split wood before?

365
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:28,394
Sure, but you do it
with such relish.

366
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,523
It's just my nature.
Sorry if it bothers you.

367
00:45:37,277 --> 00:45:38,612
You're very good.

368
00:45:38,779 --> 00:45:42,157
It's nothing compared
to how I cut down men.

369
00:45:42,324 --> 00:45:45,869
- Have you cut down many?
- That I have.

370
00:45:46,036 --> 00:45:48,747
There's no cutting me off
when I start cutting.

371
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:55,421
So I make it a point
to run away first.

372
00:45:56,338 --> 00:45:59,007
A most excellent approach.

373
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:01,385
Why, thank you kindly.

374
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:13,439
Tell me, do you feel like
cutting down 30 bandits?

375
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:34,042
Let us commence!

376
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:06,260
Too bad.

377
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:07,719
It's a draw.

378
00:48:07,886 --> 00:48:09,429
I'm afraid not.

379
00:48:09,596 --> 00:48:10,889
I won.

380
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,644
That's ridiculous!

381
00:48:17,479 --> 00:48:20,148
If these were steel,
you'd be dead now.

382
00:48:25,237 --> 00:48:27,406
- Then we fight with steel!
- Don't throw your life away.

383
00:48:27,573 --> 00:48:28,323
What?

384
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:31,827
Don't you see?
With steel blades, you'd die.

385
00:48:31,994 --> 00:48:33,453
It's a waste of your life.

386
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:36,081
Wait! Don't try to flee.

387
00:48:39,668 --> 00:48:42,671
Draw! This isn't
a contest of words!

388
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:22,794
This is preposterous.

389
00:49:24,004 --> 00:49:26,131
There's no contest.

390
00:49:57,871 --> 00:49:59,665
How did you fare?

391
00:50:03,502 --> 00:50:06,672
We let a good fish get away.
An excellent swordsman.

392
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:10,175
They say the fish that gets away
looks bigger than it really is.

393
00:50:10,342 --> 00:50:11,593
No.

394
00:50:12,636 --> 00:50:16,181
I watched him cut a man down
with my own eyes.

395
00:50:23,188 --> 00:50:24,856
It was amazing.

396
00:50:25,148 --> 00:50:29,277
A man obsessed only
with testing the limits of his skill.

397
00:50:29,861 --> 00:50:31,905
I doubt he'll join us.

398
00:50:32,072 --> 00:50:34,491
- That's a shame.
- Indeed.

399
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:38,662
I did tell him
where we're staying, though.

400
00:50:38,954 --> 00:50:40,914
And how did you fare?

401
00:50:41,456 --> 00:50:43,291
- Caught one.
- I see.

402
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:46,920
- As a swordsman, barely mediocre.
- Barely mediocre?

403
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:51,341
But an honest, amusing man.

404
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:54,302
Something about him
brightens one's spirits.

405
00:50:54,594 --> 00:50:57,222
He'll be a treasure in hard times.

406
00:50:57,556 --> 00:50:58,932
Much obliged.

407
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:05,897
Actually, I did land one myself.
- The one dressed as a peddler?

408
00:51:06,064 --> 00:51:07,232
That's right.

409
00:51:07,399 --> 00:51:10,068
In fact, he's an old trusted friend.

410
00:51:15,949 --> 00:51:17,868
I'll bring some water.

411
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,665
I'm Heihachi Hayashida.

412
00:51:23,832 --> 00:51:26,835
A modest warrior
of the Wood-Chop School.

413
00:51:32,716 --> 00:51:35,677
Just three more to go.

414
00:51:35,844 --> 00:51:38,263
Three? Don't you mean two?

415
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:40,849
No, we can't afford
to take a child along.

416
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:43,350
Master!

417
00:51:43,685 --> 00:51:45,479
I know, I know.

418
00:51:45,896 --> 00:51:48,273
I know what you'll say.

419
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:52,652
I was once your age, you know.

420
00:51:53,779 --> 00:51:55,781
Hone your skills,

421
00:51:55,989 --> 00:51:59,284
then go to war
and do great things.

422
00:51:59,618 --> 00:52:03,497
Then become lord
of your own castle and domain.

423
00:52:04,414 --> 00:52:09,753
But as you dream those dreams,
before you know it,

424
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,130
your hair will turn
as gray as mine.

425
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:17,803
By that time

426
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:21,473
you've lost your parents
and you're all alone.

427
00:53:09,521 --> 00:53:11,690
Tomorrow you go home.

428
00:53:12,023 --> 00:53:14,568
You've learned a lot
these four or five days.

429
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:16,695
You have
fine stories to tell.

430
00:53:32,544 --> 00:53:36,298
Please, sir.
I beg you to let him come along.

431
00:53:36,464 --> 00:53:39,467
Why not let him come?
You call him a kid, but —

432
00:53:39,634 --> 00:53:41,011
Actually,

433
00:53:41,177 --> 00:53:43,430
kids work harder than adults.

434
00:53:44,389 --> 00:53:48,059
But only if you treat them
like adults.

435
00:53:48,643 --> 00:53:52,063
Then let's treat him
like an adult.

436
00:53:57,736 --> 00:54:00,238
That means only two more.

437
00:54:00,405 --> 00:54:03,617
Actually just one, it seems.

438
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:12,250
You wish to join us?

439
00:54:13,418 --> 00:54:15,378
I'm very grateful.

440
00:54:15,545 --> 00:54:17,589
- When do we depart?
- Tomorrow.

441
00:54:21,384 --> 00:54:22,427
Tomorrow?

442
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:28,141
This is enough. We don't have time
to find the last one.

443
00:54:30,852 --> 00:54:32,604
All right, then.

444
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:37,525
Master!

445
00:54:38,401 --> 00:54:40,153
Master!
- All right.

446
00:54:41,196 --> 00:54:44,449
- Master!
- All right! That's enough of that!

447
00:54:49,204 --> 00:54:52,082
Hey, I just found
a real tough samurai.

448
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:54,626
There was a huge fight.
They were no match for him.

449
00:54:54,793 --> 00:54:57,420
Never seen anything like it.
He's like a wild dog.

450
00:54:57,587 --> 00:55:00,632
Someone stopped the fight.
They started drinking.

451
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:02,467
I told him about you.

452
00:55:02,634 --> 00:55:04,386
He's on his way.

453
00:55:06,763 --> 00:55:08,765
Shall we give him the usual?

454
00:55:22,737 --> 00:55:24,489
What are you doing?

455
00:55:24,906 --> 00:55:26,616
Testing him.

456
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:29,661
That's a dirty trick!

457
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:32,288
Hey, samurai!
- Just shut up and watch.

458
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:34,499
A true samurai won't get hit.

459
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:36,376
But this guy's drunk!

460
00:55:36,543 --> 00:55:39,421
A samurai never drinks
enough to dull his wits.

461
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:56,855
I told you!
You guys are nuts.

462
00:55:58,023 --> 00:55:59,774
What the —

463
00:56:03,653 --> 00:56:06,489
Who the hell hit me?

464
00:56:22,172 --> 00:56:23,840
You?

465
00:56:28,887 --> 00:56:32,182
Who hit me?

466
00:56:37,979 --> 00:56:39,481
You?

467
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:44,235
Damn bastard!

468
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,599
You again!

469
00:57:17,185 --> 00:57:20,647
I see that bald head of yours
in my dreams!

470
00:57:23,191 --> 00:57:25,151
Hey, you.

471
00:57:26,027 --> 00:57:28,947
How dare you even ask me
if I'm a samurai!

472
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:31,491
You got some nerve!

473
00:57:33,368 --> 00:57:35,203
Don't mess with me.

474
00:57:42,043 --> 00:57:45,505
I may look like hell,
but I'm a real samurai!

475
00:57:49,008 --> 00:57:53,471
I've been looking for you
ever since that day.

476
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:56,766
Wanted you to see this.

477
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:06,818
Look at this!

478
00:58:06,985 --> 00:58:11,990
This is my family tree.
All my ancestors are here.

479
00:58:13,867 --> 00:58:18,163
Damn you, trying to make
a fool outta me. Screw you.

480
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:21,374
Looky here.

481
00:58:23,001 --> 00:58:24,794
Making a fool outta me.

482
00:58:31,426 --> 00:58:33,720
My honorable self
is right here.

483
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:37,140
So this Kikuchiyo here
would be you?

484
00:58:37,307 --> 00:58:39,142
That is correct.

485
00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:43,688
"Kikuchiyo,
born February 17, 1574."

486
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:47,859
What's so damned funny?

487
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,113
You hardly look
13 years old to me.

488
00:58:53,031 --> 00:58:56,993
If you are in fact
the Kikuchiyo listed here,

489
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,038
you'd now be precisely
13 years old.

490
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,295
Where'd you steal
this family tree?

491
00:59:07,879 --> 00:59:11,257
Steal it? Shit!

492
00:59:11,883 --> 00:59:13,885
Damn jerks.

493
00:59:14,052 --> 00:59:16,095
To hell with samurai.

494
00:59:17,555 --> 00:59:19,724
To hell with samurai!

495
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,979
Hey, you bastard!

496
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:29,108
Come back here!

497
00:59:29,275 --> 00:59:32,570
Goddamn it,
you son of a bitch!

498
00:59:42,705 --> 00:59:46,042
What's wrong, teenager?
Here you are.

499
00:59:48,253 --> 00:59:50,421
Damn you!

500
00:59:52,048 --> 00:59:54,008
Come back here!

501
01:00:29,002 --> 01:00:31,004
What's wrong, Lord Kikuchiyo?

502
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:37,927
What's the matter, junior?

503
01:00:47,478 --> 01:00:50,106
Screw samurai!

504
01:01:06,664 --> 01:01:10,335
- Is he really a samurai?
- In his own mind, anyway.

505
01:01:21,429 --> 01:01:23,389
<i>Take me too!</i>

506
01:01:28,186 --> 01:01:30,730
Hey, Kikuchiyo.

507
01:01:33,358 --> 01:01:35,276
Guard your treasure.

508
01:01:37,111 --> 01:01:40,114
Let me go too!

509
01:02:20,696 --> 01:02:22,865
What is it, Father?

510
01:02:39,424 --> 01:02:41,259
What is it?

511
01:02:42,093 --> 01:02:44,262
What are you staring at?

512
01:02:52,437 --> 01:02:56,023
Shino, cut off your hair.

513
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:58,818
Cut your hair
and dress like a man.

514
01:03:00,945 --> 01:03:03,489
- What are you talking about?
- Just cut it off!

515
01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:08,453
It's only because I love you.
No telling what those samurai'll do!

516
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:09,619
No!

517
01:03:09,704 --> 01:03:12,123
No, I won't!

518
01:03:16,461 --> 01:03:17,962
Shino!

519
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,155
He's a fool.

520
01:03:44,322 --> 01:03:47,825
But Manzo knows those samurai
better than anyone.

521
01:03:47,992 --> 01:03:50,119
If he cut off his daughter's hair,
he must have good reason.

522
01:03:50,286 --> 01:03:53,456
You've only got sons,
so you're safe, but we —

523
01:03:53,623 --> 01:03:56,167
Goddamn it!
Now I understand.

524
01:03:56,334 --> 01:04:00,254
So you agree to hide my daughter
at your place across the bridge?

525
01:04:00,421 --> 01:04:03,382
Idiot! I meant that I see
what Manzo's up to.

526
01:04:04,091 --> 01:04:09,805
That rascal doesn't care about the village,
only about his daughter.

527
01:04:10,139 --> 01:04:11,557
Damn him!

528
01:04:30,618 --> 01:04:32,870
Look what you've done!

529
01:04:33,287 --> 01:04:35,373
Now the whole village is crazed.

530
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:37,833
Every family
with a girl's gone mad.

531
01:04:39,585 --> 01:04:41,712
How do you plan
to set this right?

532
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:44,674
The samurai will show up
any day now.

533
01:04:45,508 --> 01:04:48,553
Come on.
We're seeing the Old Man.

534
01:04:50,555 --> 01:04:53,599
There's nothing to see here!
Go home!

535
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:56,269
Go home!

536
01:04:58,062 --> 01:05:01,607
We can't let the samurai
see us like this.

537
01:05:08,364 --> 01:05:10,366
He's still following us.

538
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,723
Where did Kikuchiyo go?

539
01:06:58,641 --> 01:07:00,393
Think he gave up?

540
01:07:00,601 --> 01:07:02,395
It's funny.

541
01:07:02,687 --> 01:07:04,814
Now that he's gone,
it's almost a little...

542
01:07:05,189 --> 01:07:06,982
lonely.

543
01:07:12,863 --> 01:07:14,532
This way.

544
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:18,786
Oh, hell!

545
01:07:31,716 --> 01:07:34,301
So that's our castle, eh?

546
01:07:35,386 --> 01:07:38,139
No way I'm gonna die
in that dungheap.

547
01:07:38,305 --> 01:07:40,891
No one asked you to.

548
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:03,164
We're back!
The samurai have arrived!

549
01:08:08,169 --> 01:08:10,212
The samurai are here!

550
01:08:14,842 --> 01:08:18,554
What's wrong with you?
The samurai are here!

551
01:08:24,643 --> 01:08:26,729
Hey, what's wrong?

552
01:08:30,733 --> 01:08:32,568
What's the matter?

553
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:48,918
This is a fine welcome.

554
01:08:52,505 --> 01:08:54,632
What's the meaning of this?

555
01:08:57,468 --> 01:09:01,472
Hey, what's going on?
The samurai have arrived!

556
01:09:17,530 --> 01:09:19,907
- We'll go see the Old Man.
- The Old Man?

557
01:09:20,074 --> 01:09:23,077
Whatever happens in the village,
the Old Man —

558
01:09:23,244 --> 01:09:25,329
He's the village elder?

559
01:09:26,831 --> 01:09:31,335
An audience with the village elder.
This is truly an honor.

560
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:36,799
Well, let's go.

561
01:10:48,787 --> 01:10:54,209
I know they're being foolish.

562
01:10:55,044 --> 01:10:58,464
All farmers ever do is worry,

563
01:10:58,631 --> 01:11:03,510
whether the rain falls,
the sun shines, or the wind blows.

564
01:11:03,802 --> 01:11:05,930
In short,

565
01:11:06,513 --> 01:11:10,100
all they know is fear.

566
01:11:10,434 --> 01:11:14,104
Their behavior today...

567
01:11:15,689 --> 01:11:19,276
is also due simply to fear.

568
01:11:21,946 --> 01:11:27,034
But Old Man,
why do the villagers fear us?

569
01:11:27,952 --> 01:11:31,747
What can they expect from us
under such circumstances?

570
01:12:02,486 --> 01:12:04,196
Samurai, sirs!

571
01:12:04,822 --> 01:12:07,449
Samurai, please!

572
01:12:24,299 --> 01:12:27,553
Quiet down!

573
01:12:28,303 --> 01:12:30,848
Don't panic. Calm down.

574
01:12:31,515 --> 01:12:34,268
I want clear answers.

575
01:12:34,435 --> 01:12:36,770
Where are the bandits
coming from?

576
01:12:36,937 --> 01:12:40,232
- The mountains!
- No, the road!

577
01:12:43,485 --> 01:12:46,697
Who saw the bandits?
Come forward.

578
01:12:46,905 --> 01:12:49,158
No one saw any bandits?

579
01:12:49,783 --> 01:12:51,869
Then who sounded the alarm?

580
01:12:52,036 --> 01:12:53,328
<i>I did!</i>

581
01:12:59,835 --> 01:13:02,171
Outta the way.

582
01:13:06,759 --> 01:13:09,303
What's with the faces?

583
01:13:10,554 --> 01:13:13,682
Don't worry.
No bandits have come.

584
01:13:18,937 --> 01:13:20,731
Hey, blockheads.

585
01:13:20,898 --> 01:13:24,568
Remember how you welcomed us
when we got here?

586
01:13:24,902 --> 01:13:27,571
But as soon as I bang on this,

587
01:13:27,738 --> 01:13:31,158
"Samurai, sirs!
Samurai, please!"

588
01:13:31,575 --> 01:13:33,869
You're practically groveling!

589
01:13:38,707 --> 01:13:41,376
Got what you deserved,
you mud snails.

590
01:13:59,103 --> 01:14:01,688
Got a problem, gramps?

591
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:03,190
Nope.

592
01:14:03,607 --> 01:14:05,734
All's well now.

593
01:14:11,323 --> 01:14:14,034
Looks like he's good
for something after all.

594
01:14:14,201 --> 01:14:16,829
There are seven of us at last.

595
01:14:24,002 --> 01:14:26,004
Sorry it's so dirty.

596
01:14:26,171 --> 01:14:30,050
But where will you sleep
if we take your home?

597
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:33,762
- In the barn.
- With your horse?

598
01:14:35,264 --> 01:14:38,225
The bandits
got my horse last year.

599
01:14:55,534 --> 01:14:59,163
A barn's not so bad
with a wife to snuggle up to.

600
01:15:03,333 --> 01:15:05,669
I don't have a wife!

601
01:15:05,836 --> 01:15:07,546
What's the matter, you fool?

602
01:15:19,141 --> 01:15:20,642
Jerk.

603
01:15:34,198 --> 01:15:36,867
By the way,
what's your real name?

604
01:15:38,744 --> 01:15:40,621
I don't remember.

605
01:15:40,996 --> 01:15:43,373
Give me a new one that fits.

606
01:15:43,832 --> 01:15:46,043
Then Kikuchiyo it is.

607
01:15:47,211 --> 01:15:49,379
Fits you perfectly.

608
01:16:09,691 --> 01:16:12,402
How would you attack
this village?

609
01:16:12,569 --> 01:16:15,155
I'd charge from this mountain.

610
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,909
I agree.
Along this road.

611
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:21,620
WEST

612
01:16:36,635 --> 01:16:39,471
And what's the best defense?

613
01:16:39,763 --> 01:16:41,890
Shichiroji knows what to do.

614
01:16:42,557 --> 01:16:45,978
See these logs?
He'll make a fence to block the horses.

615
01:16:46,144 --> 01:16:48,647
Indeed.
Your trusty right-hand man.

616
01:17:17,634 --> 01:17:18,969
All right!

617
01:17:19,553 --> 01:17:21,138
Listen.

618
01:17:22,264 --> 01:17:24,266
Nothing forces you to run
like a battle.

619
01:17:24,766 --> 01:17:27,644
You run when you attack,
you run when you retreat.

620
01:17:27,811 --> 01:17:30,188
When you can't run anymore,
you die.

621
01:17:48,665 --> 01:17:51,209
SOUTH

622
01:18:04,514 --> 01:18:08,226
We'll flood these fields
after they harvest the barley.

623
01:18:08,477 --> 01:18:13,106
That'll make a good defense.
But will we have time?

624
01:18:13,273 --> 01:18:14,608
Indeed.

625
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:23,658
Charge!

626
01:18:24,618 --> 01:18:28,789
Pretend I'm a bandit
and stab me.

627
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:33,418
Charge!

628
01:18:36,588 --> 01:18:38,298
Come on!

629
01:18:47,265 --> 01:18:48,725
Next.

630
01:18:50,435 --> 01:18:51,978
Next.

631
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:54,398
What's wrong with all of you?

632
01:19:18,422 --> 01:19:21,591
EAST

633
01:19:25,095 --> 01:19:29,724
Destroying this bridge
will foil an assault from the east.

634
01:19:36,731 --> 01:19:39,901
But what about the houses
on the other side?

635
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,828
They'll have to evacuate those.

636
01:19:54,166 --> 01:19:56,293
And the mill?

637
01:19:58,211 --> 01:20:01,423
The Old Man's
not going to go quietly.

638
01:20:07,637 --> 01:20:10,474
Listen now.
The enemy is scary.

639
01:20:11,057 --> 01:20:12,601
Everybody's scared.

640
01:20:12,767 --> 01:20:16,271
But the other side's
scared of us too.

641
01:20:45,592 --> 01:20:47,302
Just great.

642
01:20:48,261 --> 01:20:51,014
You all make great scarecrows.

643
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:57,270
Problem is, the enemy
isn't a bunch of sparrows and crows!

644
01:21:05,695 --> 01:21:09,407
You there, chewing your cud.
Can you cut that out?

645
01:21:13,537 --> 01:21:15,580
This isn't a cow shed!

646
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:21,294
Look at the bunch of you.

647
01:21:24,214 --> 01:21:25,882
Shit!

648
01:21:26,049 --> 01:21:28,760
First in line, step forward!

649
01:21:31,096 --> 01:21:33,181
I'm talking to you!

650
01:21:33,723 --> 01:21:34,933
You!

651
01:21:55,161 --> 01:21:58,456
Look here! You gotta pay
a <i>mon</i> each to watch the show!

652
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:19,102
What's this?

653
01:22:20,103 --> 01:22:23,064
- A spear, sir.
- Idiot.

654
01:22:23,231 --> 01:22:25,984
Where the hell
did you get it?

655
01:22:26,901 --> 01:22:29,404
Did it sprout up in those hills?

656
01:22:31,781 --> 01:22:33,283
I know perfectly well.

657
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:35,910
You hunted down retreating warriors
and took their weapons.

658
01:22:36,161 --> 01:22:39,914
If you've got one,
you must have more.

659
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,419
Fess up, damn it!

660
01:22:53,178 --> 01:22:55,680
NORTH

661
01:23:05,065 --> 01:23:09,319
What a peaceful grove.
But it's also a death trap.

662
01:23:45,146 --> 01:23:46,690
Katsushiro.

663
01:23:47,023 --> 01:23:49,275
We're going.
- I'll be right there.

664
01:23:57,242 --> 01:23:59,202
As I said,
he's still a child.

665
01:25:00,764 --> 01:25:03,558
Are you from the village?

666
01:25:08,104 --> 01:25:09,481
Are you a girl?

667
01:25:13,193 --> 01:25:15,445
A boy?

668
01:25:16,279 --> 01:25:19,282
Then where's your spear?

669
01:25:19,449 --> 01:25:22,869
Is this any time for an able-bodied man
to be picking flowers?

670
01:25:23,745 --> 01:25:26,039
Come here!
I'll teach you.

671
01:25:26,456 --> 01:25:28,041
Come here!

672
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:34,130
Why, you!

673
01:26:38,862 --> 01:26:41,823
This is fine, and this too.

674
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:43,908
But this is a problem.

675
01:26:44,409 --> 01:26:46,995
<i>Heave ho! Heave ho!</i>

676
01:26:49,831 --> 01:26:52,250
Get back, the rest of you!

677
01:26:52,876 --> 01:26:55,378
Stand up straight!

678
01:27:00,717 --> 01:27:02,552
What a haul!

679
01:27:08,975 --> 01:27:10,310
What's all this?

680
01:27:10,476 --> 01:27:12,854
Plunder from defeated warriors.

681
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,399
Where did you find it?

682
01:27:16,566 --> 01:27:19,569
Here in the village?
- Yep, over at Manzo's.

683
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,914
What's the matter?

684
01:27:32,916 --> 01:27:34,751
Don't you like 'em?

685
01:27:36,878 --> 01:27:39,422
This is good stuff.

686
01:27:40,965 --> 01:27:42,592
What's wrong?

687
01:27:42,759 --> 01:27:46,179
You said you wanted armor,
spears and bows. Now you got 'em.

688
01:27:46,346 --> 01:27:48,806
Bastard!
You call yourself a samurai?

689
01:27:50,099 --> 01:27:53,102
Those farmers killed samurai
to get these.

690
01:27:53,269 --> 01:27:55,271
- I know that.
- Then why the hell —

691
01:27:55,438 --> 01:27:57,273
That's enough!

692
01:27:58,608 --> 01:28:02,278
You can't understand
unless you've been hunted.

693
01:28:15,083 --> 01:28:17,794
It's nothing.
Get outta here.

694
01:28:41,067 --> 01:28:45,989
Now I want to kill them all.

695
01:28:59,836 --> 01:29:01,796
Well, that's just fine and dandy!

696
01:29:04,298 --> 01:29:08,761
What did ya think
these farmers were anyway?

697
01:29:08,928 --> 01:29:11,514
Buddhas or something?

698
01:29:12,015 --> 01:29:13,641
Don't make me laugh!

699
01:29:13,808 --> 01:29:16,269
There's no creature on earth
as wily as a farmer!

700
01:29:22,108 --> 01:29:24,986
Ask 'em for rice, barley,
anything,

701
01:29:25,153 --> 01:29:27,530
and all they ever say is,
"We're all out."

702
01:29:28,906 --> 01:29:33,244
But they've got it.
They've got everything.

703
01:29:34,162 --> 01:29:38,207
Dig under the floorboards.
If it's not there, try the barn.

704
01:29:38,374 --> 01:29:43,880
You'll find plenty.
Jars of rice, salt, beans, sake!

705
01:29:48,885 --> 01:29:52,055
Go up in the mountains.
They have hidden fields.

706
01:29:52,597 --> 01:29:55,266
They kowtow and lie,
playing innocent the whole time.

707
01:29:55,433 --> 01:29:57,894
You name it,
they'll cheat you on it!

708
01:29:58,061 --> 01:30:01,105
After a battle, they hunt down
the losers with their spears.

709
01:30:03,483 --> 01:30:04,650
Listen to me!

710
01:30:04,817 --> 01:30:08,404
Farmers are misers, weasels,

711
01:30:08,571 --> 01:30:09,822
and crybabies!

712
01:30:09,989 --> 01:30:12,408
They're mean, stupid

713
01:30:12,575 --> 01:30:14,368
murderers!

714
01:30:14,577 --> 01:30:17,705
Damn!
I could laugh till I cry!

715
01:30:21,334 --> 01:30:25,171
But tell me this:
Who turned them into such monsters?

716
01:30:25,421 --> 01:30:28,841
You did!
You samurai did!

717
01:30:29,258 --> 01:30:31,094
Damn you to hell!

718
01:30:37,934 --> 01:30:39,769
In war, you burn their villages,

719
01:30:39,936 --> 01:30:43,106
trample their fields,
steal their food,

720
01:30:43,856 --> 01:30:46,943
work them like slaves,
rape their women,

721
01:30:47,110 --> 01:30:48,778
and kill 'em if they resist.

722
01:30:48,945 --> 01:30:50,822
What do you expect 'em to do?

723
01:30:50,988 --> 01:30:53,324
What the hell are farmers
supposed to do?

724
01:30:53,491 --> 01:30:55,993
Damn it! Goddamn it!

725
01:31:33,781 --> 01:31:37,410
You were born a farmer,
weren't you?

726
01:32:14,947 --> 01:32:18,284
What is it now?

727
01:32:18,451 --> 01:32:22,413
Nothing at all.
Everything's fine.

728
01:33:28,104 --> 01:33:29,647
It's me.

729
01:33:29,897 --> 01:33:31,941
I'm sleeping here
from now on.

730
01:33:32,608 --> 01:33:34,944
Those guys cramp my style.

731
01:33:36,696 --> 01:33:39,782
Idiot! Stop cowering!

732
01:33:40,449 --> 01:33:42,493
This is your place!

733
01:33:42,994 --> 01:33:45,830
You hand over your house
and sleep in a barn,

734
01:33:45,997 --> 01:33:47,832
and still you can't stand up
for yourself.

735
01:33:47,999 --> 01:33:49,542
Get to sleep!

736
01:34:06,142 --> 01:34:08,102
Brings back memories.

737
01:34:26,495 --> 01:34:28,456
Sure is quiet.

738
01:34:31,334 --> 01:34:36,672
On a day like this, it's hard
to imagine bandits on that mountain.

739
01:34:38,591 --> 01:34:41,719
Damn it all,
I need a girl!

740
01:34:50,519 --> 01:34:52,021
- Where are you going?
- The hills.

741
01:34:52,188 --> 01:34:54,315
- The hills?
- To practice.

742
01:34:55,941 --> 01:34:57,568
No girls up there.

743
01:34:59,236 --> 01:35:02,031
Sometimes you really
hit the nail on the head.

744
01:35:03,157 --> 01:35:05,451
What are you making there?

745
01:35:05,618 --> 01:35:07,578
- A flag.
- A flag?

746
01:35:08,287 --> 01:35:13,959
It doesn't feel right in battle
without a banner to raise high.

747
01:35:18,756 --> 01:35:20,508
What do the symbols mean?

748
01:35:20,674 --> 01:35:25,513
This represents a field:
that is, the farmers and this village.

749
01:35:26,389 --> 01:35:28,808
- And those circles?
- Those are us.

750
01:35:29,725 --> 01:35:32,395
There's only six.
You leaving me out?

751
01:35:32,561 --> 01:35:35,689
No, this triangle's Lord Kikuchiyo.

752
01:35:35,856 --> 01:35:37,733
That's a good one!

753
01:36:58,898 --> 01:37:00,649
It's real rice.

754
01:37:00,941 --> 01:37:02,860
Go ahead. Eat.
- But —

755
01:37:03,027 --> 01:37:05,237
Rikichi gave me some millet.

756
01:37:05,404 --> 01:37:09,742
I could barely get it down.

757
01:37:11,744 --> 01:37:13,537
Go ahead. Eat.

758
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:26,300
Hurry up and eat.

759
01:37:26,467 --> 01:37:28,344
If you're embarrassed, I'll go.

760
01:37:28,511 --> 01:37:30,387
I'm not going to eat it.

761
01:37:30,596 --> 01:37:32,848
Why not?
I went to a lot of trouble.

762
01:37:33,015 --> 01:37:34,934
No, I just —

763
01:37:36,185 --> 01:37:41,482
I know you did, so I'll take it
to Kyuemon's grandma.

764
01:37:41,690 --> 01:37:44,443
Kyuemon's grandma?

765
01:38:05,089 --> 01:38:09,385
Rikichi, I'm full.
I'll save the rest for later.

766
01:38:10,094 --> 01:38:12,513
Go ahead and eat.

767
01:38:12,721 --> 01:38:14,723
Take my leftovers this time.

768
01:38:15,724 --> 01:38:19,311
What's this?
What are you up to?

769
01:38:19,478 --> 01:38:21,063
What's going on?

770
01:38:29,071 --> 01:38:30,906
How terrible.

771
01:38:32,324 --> 01:38:36,453
Doesn't she have family?
- The bandits got them all.

772
01:38:42,918 --> 01:38:44,420
I...

773
01:38:45,254 --> 01:38:50,050
want to die quickly.

774
01:38:50,217 --> 01:38:54,471
I want to die soon

775
01:38:54,638 --> 01:38:58,934
and leave this suffering behind.

776
01:39:00,477 --> 01:39:02,896
But you know...

777
01:39:03,939 --> 01:39:07,860
the other world may be

778
01:39:08,027 --> 01:39:12,197
just as full of suffering
as this one.

779
01:39:13,991 --> 01:39:15,784
It's not.

780
01:39:15,951 --> 01:39:20,331
In that world
there's no war and no bandits.

781
01:39:20,664 --> 01:39:22,875
There's no suffering there,
grandma.

782
01:39:23,042 --> 01:39:26,670
How the hell would you know?
Have you been there?

783
01:39:26,837 --> 01:39:28,631
Why the hell
are you always screaming?

784
01:39:28,797 --> 01:39:30,507
I hate wimps.

785
01:39:30,674 --> 01:39:33,344
Worms like her make me sick!

786
01:39:35,888 --> 01:39:38,015
Pissing and grumbling
about everything.

787
01:39:39,475 --> 01:39:42,478
Shit!
I want to do something wild!

788
01:39:42,686 --> 01:39:46,607
Save your spit and fire
for the bandits.

789
01:40:02,331 --> 01:40:04,166
Excuse me.

790
01:40:06,085 --> 01:40:09,254
Excuse me, but why did you —

791
01:40:09,505 --> 01:40:12,257
You saw us today, didn't you?

792
01:40:12,424 --> 01:40:14,927
Me and the —

793
01:40:15,094 --> 01:40:17,096
- The girl?
- Yes.

794
01:40:18,055 --> 01:40:21,850
Why didn't you —
- Tell them? You want me to?

795
01:40:37,032 --> 01:40:41,495
We want rice!
White rice!

796
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:49,878
You little brats!
There's no rice!

797
01:40:55,551 --> 01:40:57,594
Quit yapping!

798
01:40:57,761 --> 01:41:02,766
If you've got the strength
to scream, "We want rice!"

799
01:41:02,933 --> 01:41:05,352
then you don't need it!

800
01:41:05,728 --> 01:41:08,605
Listen here,
you little piss pants.

801
01:41:10,649 --> 01:41:12,901
This is all the rice there is.

802
01:41:13,068 --> 01:41:16,280
If we give you any more,
we'll get all —

803
01:41:19,950 --> 01:41:21,452
That's how it is.

804
01:41:21,618 --> 01:41:25,414
Say, any of you got
a pretty sister?

805
01:41:27,833 --> 01:41:31,587
How about you?
You got one?

806
01:41:31,795 --> 01:41:35,424
So, Old Man,
when is the harvest?

807
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:39,595
In ten days.

808
01:41:39,762 --> 01:41:42,055
How quickly can you do it?

809
01:41:44,057 --> 01:41:46,935
No less than three days.

810
01:41:47,936 --> 01:41:50,063
We'll flood the fields
when you're done.

811
01:41:50,230 --> 01:41:54,067
You see, we want to create
a moat to the south of the village.

812
01:41:54,234 --> 01:41:56,403
It'll keep the horses out.

813
01:41:56,570 --> 01:41:59,948
We don't need all the fields.
One patch per family will do.

814
01:42:00,115 --> 01:42:01,617
Then...

815
01:42:02,117 --> 01:42:06,455
it'll take at least a day to flatten
the paths and draw the water.

816
01:42:06,622 --> 01:42:08,999
Understood.

817
01:42:09,291 --> 01:42:11,627
There's one other thing.

818
01:42:12,085 --> 01:42:18,383
You need to leave the houses this side
of the bridge, and the mill too.

819
01:42:19,468 --> 01:42:21,261
Father!

820
01:42:21,512 --> 01:42:23,680
You want us to move out?

821
01:42:30,979 --> 01:42:33,315
I know it's tough.

822
01:42:34,942 --> 01:42:37,069
But there's no choice.

823
01:42:38,654 --> 01:42:42,616
We can't possibly protect
the outlying houses.

824
01:43:03,804 --> 01:43:07,099
Listen carefully. You'll soon
begin harvesting the barley.

825
01:43:07,349 --> 01:43:09,309
The bandits will come
when you're done.

826
01:43:09,476 --> 01:43:11,353
We have to assume that.

827
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:15,315
Therefore we prepare
for battle as we harvest.

828
01:43:15,691 --> 01:43:19,236
We'll harvest not as families
but as squads.

829
01:43:19,695 --> 01:43:24,032
Starting tomorrow,
each squad will live and work as one.

830
01:43:24,199 --> 01:43:29,121
Understood? Starting tomorrow,
nobody acts on his own.

831
01:43:30,372 --> 01:43:32,291
Hey, everybody.

832
01:43:33,876 --> 01:43:37,880
Give your wives
plenty of lovin' tonight, you hear?

833
01:43:59,026 --> 01:44:01,570
This is all a load of crap!

834
01:44:01,737 --> 01:44:04,573
Everyone from across the bridge,
follow me.

835
01:44:07,242 --> 01:44:09,369
Throw down your spears.

836
01:44:09,536 --> 01:44:13,582
Why should we abandon
our homes to protect theirs?

837
01:44:14,416 --> 01:44:18,045
That's right.
We'll protect our homes ourselves.

838
01:44:20,088 --> 01:44:21,715
Stop!

839
01:44:24,801 --> 01:44:26,678
Pick up your spears!

840
01:44:27,304 --> 01:44:28,805
Return to your line!

841
01:44:54,623 --> 01:44:56,875
Fall in!

842
01:44:57,793 --> 01:45:00,045
Squad formation!

843
01:45:03,048 --> 01:45:05,509
Where's Yohei gone?

844
01:45:06,885 --> 01:45:08,637
Where the hell's Yohei?

845
01:45:14,142 --> 01:45:17,229
There you are, you idiot!

846
01:45:34,830 --> 01:45:37,040
There are three outlying houses,

847
01:45:37,874 --> 01:45:39,960
but 20 in the village.

848
01:45:40,794 --> 01:45:44,756
We can't risk 20
to save three.

849
01:45:46,008 --> 01:45:50,345
And if this village is destroyed,

850
01:45:51,179 --> 01:45:53,390
those three cannot survive
on their own.

851
01:45:57,436 --> 01:46:00,939
Is that clear?
This is the nature of war:

852
01:46:02,441 --> 01:46:05,277
By protecting others,
you save yourself.

853
01:46:07,237 --> 01:46:09,740
If you only think of yourself,

854
01:46:10,198 --> 01:46:12,409
you'll only destroy yourself.

855
01:46:15,495 --> 01:46:19,291
From this day forward,
anyone caught doing that...

856
01:46:45,901 --> 01:46:49,488
INTERMISSION

857
01:52:48,972 --> 01:52:50,598
Hot damn!

858
01:52:50,765 --> 01:52:52,600
Look at all those girls!

859
01:52:52,851 --> 01:52:54,227
Hey, Yohei!

860
01:52:59,774 --> 01:53:02,569
Where the hell
have you been hiding these girls?

861
01:53:06,865 --> 01:53:08,658
You devil.

862
01:53:16,458 --> 01:53:18,751
Hey, lend me your scythe.

863
01:53:19,919 --> 01:53:21,963
I'll cut three times your share.

864
01:53:22,130 --> 01:53:25,175
In return,
we get nice and friendly, eh?

865
01:53:49,199 --> 01:53:50,658
- Rikichi.
- Yes.

866
01:53:51,868 --> 01:53:55,538
It seems the married couples
are the most productive.

867
01:53:56,206 --> 01:53:58,374
Time you got yourself a wife.

868
01:54:01,753 --> 01:54:05,924
Why do you always get so mad?
I just said you should —

869
01:54:07,133 --> 01:54:09,427
Katsushiro, go after him.

870
01:54:09,594 --> 01:54:11,721
Running off at a time like this.

871
01:54:12,889 --> 01:54:14,349
Rikichi!

872
01:54:15,350 --> 01:54:16,809
Rikichi!

873
01:54:20,980 --> 01:54:23,691
Shino, what are you gawking at?

874
01:54:39,791 --> 01:54:43,002
What's this? A bear's den?

875
01:54:45,004 --> 01:54:47,173
This was done with a scythe.

876
01:54:49,300 --> 01:54:50,635
Was it Rikichi?

877
01:54:51,219 --> 01:54:53,721
Yes, though I didn't actually
see him do it.

878
01:54:53,888 --> 01:54:56,099
I lost him for a while,

879
01:54:56,266 --> 01:54:58,184
but then I spotted him
leaving this grove.

880
01:54:58,351 --> 01:55:01,521
He was furious,
soaked in sweat.

881
01:55:05,108 --> 01:55:06,776
What did you say to him?

882
01:55:06,943 --> 01:55:10,446
Nothing. Just that he should
hurry up and find a wife.

883
01:55:13,741 --> 01:55:17,954
Something's upsetting the little bugger,
but he won't say what.

884
01:55:18,413 --> 01:55:20,832
You can see it
all over his face.

885
01:55:21,624 --> 01:55:27,213
Those lips of his
are bolted up tight as a house.

886
01:55:27,380 --> 01:55:29,799
Why don't you try to open them up?

887
01:55:37,181 --> 01:55:38,181
Who's there?

888
01:55:38,266 --> 01:55:39,559
<i>It's me.</i>

889
01:55:41,894 --> 01:55:44,439
All clear?
- Yes.

890
01:55:51,821 --> 01:55:55,825
Have a seat.
Let's have a little chat.

891
01:56:00,997 --> 01:56:04,542
I think talking...

892
01:56:05,209 --> 01:56:07,086
is a good thing.

893
01:56:07,629 --> 01:56:11,674
Whatever your burden may be,
talking can ease it.

894
01:56:14,844 --> 01:56:18,765
You, for example,
seem pretty tight-lipped,

895
01:56:19,182 --> 01:56:23,895
but if you're suffering,
you shouldn't bottle it up.

896
01:56:26,648 --> 01:56:31,194
Letting out your feelings
bit by bit can work wonders.

897
01:56:32,403 --> 01:56:35,073
I've got nothing to say.

898
01:56:52,674 --> 01:56:54,550
Time to head out.

899
01:56:57,053 --> 01:56:58,137
Shall we wake him?

900
01:56:58,304 --> 01:57:00,515
No, let the kid sleep.

901
01:57:04,435 --> 01:57:05,895
Shino.

902
01:57:08,648 --> 01:57:10,733
I swear he just said "Shino."

903
01:57:13,736 --> 01:57:15,613
Sounds like a woman's name.

904
01:57:15,780 --> 01:57:18,616
Even kids can be charmers
in their dreams.

905
01:57:24,997 --> 01:57:27,542
Where shall we start our rounds?

906
01:57:27,709 --> 01:57:30,920
The place that worries us most,
of course.

907
01:58:28,269 --> 01:58:29,771
Who's there?

908
01:58:36,569 --> 01:58:38,112
Who's there?

909
01:58:38,654 --> 01:58:40,323
Come out here!

910
01:58:41,032 --> 01:58:42,033
Who's there?

911
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:43,659
Kikuchiyo.

912
01:58:45,995 --> 01:58:48,080
You're lucky it was us.

913
01:58:48,456 --> 01:58:51,626
If we'd been bandits,
you'd be headless right now.

914
01:59:23,616 --> 01:59:25,159
Yohei.

915
01:59:26,536 --> 01:59:28,246
What's this?

916
01:59:28,538 --> 01:59:30,665
That's my horse, sir.

917
01:59:32,959 --> 01:59:35,795
I thought it was a big old mouse.

918
02:00:15,418 --> 02:00:19,505
<i>The sparrows chirp, chirp, chirp</i>

919
02:00:20,423 --> 02:00:24,260
<i>The crows caw, caw, caw</i>

920
02:00:28,055 --> 02:00:31,350
I wonder why
the bandits aren't coming.

921
02:00:33,644 --> 02:00:39,108
What a waste if they don't.
Think how much we feed those samurai.

922
02:00:39,275 --> 02:00:43,070
Idiot!
It's best if they don't come!

923
02:00:49,619 --> 02:00:52,872
A nag like that
can't carry your weight!

924
02:00:53,039 --> 02:00:56,334
Yohei's horse is too worn out.

925
02:00:58,419 --> 02:01:01,547
Please stop. Yohei'll be in tears
if you break its leg.

926
02:01:01,714 --> 02:01:05,301
A skilled horseman
can make even a nag soar into the sky.

927
02:01:17,271 --> 02:01:18,522
Not bad.

928
02:01:34,246 --> 02:01:36,207
Very fine indeed!

929
02:02:00,189 --> 02:02:02,274
They seem to be having fun.

930
02:02:03,818 --> 02:02:06,696
The threshing's done,
and still no bandits.

931
02:02:07,113 --> 02:02:10,533
Everyone's saying
they might not come after all.

932
02:02:11,742 --> 02:02:14,036
A tempting thought.

933
02:02:14,537 --> 02:02:19,750
But when you think you're safe
is precisely when you're most vulnerable.

934
02:02:21,043 --> 02:02:23,462
Send them back
to their posts.

935
02:02:56,912 --> 02:03:00,666
I wish I'd been born
into a samurai family.

936
02:03:03,753 --> 02:03:05,755
A farmer's life is too cruel.

937
02:03:06,839 --> 02:03:09,925
My life has been so easy,
I'm ashamed.

938
02:03:10,092 --> 02:03:12,428
That's not what I meant.

939
02:03:12,762 --> 02:03:17,266
It's because you're a samurai
and I'm a farmer.

940
02:03:17,433 --> 02:03:18,893
But I don't —

941
02:03:19,060 --> 02:03:22,313
It's all right. I don't mind.
We can't know

942
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:24,690
what the future holds!

943
02:03:57,973 --> 02:04:01,227
Coward!
Act like a samurai!

944
02:05:08,252 --> 02:05:11,046
Three suspicious characters
on the western road.

945
02:05:13,465 --> 02:05:16,260
- The villagers haven't noticed?
- Not yet.

946
02:05:16,427 --> 02:05:18,512
We can't have them
sounding the alarm.

947
02:05:20,890 --> 02:05:23,809
I saw three horses
up in the hills.

948
02:05:23,976 --> 02:05:26,896
I think they're bandits.
- We know.

949
02:05:31,567 --> 02:05:33,819
- So they're here.
- How did you know?

950
02:05:33,986 --> 02:05:37,198
How could I not?
This one here was in such a panic.

951
02:05:40,576 --> 02:05:43,245
Where are they coming from?
The mountains or the west?

952
02:05:45,581 --> 02:05:47,082
The west.

953
02:05:55,758 --> 02:05:56,758
Bandits!

954
02:06:01,138 --> 02:06:04,266
Send everyone to their houses.
There are only three of them.

955
02:06:04,433 --> 02:06:07,228
Tell them to keep quiet
no matter what.

956
02:06:07,394 --> 02:06:11,774
They're probably scouts.
We can't let them see any samurai.

957
02:06:28,958 --> 02:06:31,126
What is it?

958
02:06:31,502 --> 02:06:33,295
Bandits?

959
02:06:35,965 --> 02:06:39,009
Bandits, eh?
Where are they?

960
02:06:50,646 --> 02:06:51,981
Quiet!

961
02:06:53,983 --> 02:06:55,859
Where are they, Shichiroji?

962
02:06:56,026 --> 02:06:58,779
Beyond the fence.

963
02:07:13,168 --> 02:07:15,754
No doubt about it — they're scouts.

964
02:07:16,255 --> 02:07:18,173
The fence took them by surprise.

965
02:07:19,258 --> 02:07:21,677
They don't seem
to realize we're here.

966
02:07:21,844 --> 02:07:24,972
With luck they'll report
there are only farmers here.

967
02:07:26,515 --> 02:07:29,101
<i>Hey, where is everyone?</i>

968
02:07:29,268 --> 02:07:30,978
That idiot!

969
02:07:32,021 --> 02:07:33,939
Kikuchiyo!

970
02:07:40,154 --> 02:07:42,531
Hey, I hear the bandits are here.

971
02:07:44,199 --> 02:07:44,992
You fool.

972
02:07:45,159 --> 02:07:47,494
Too late.
They've seen us.

973
02:07:58,339 --> 02:08:01,884
If they report back that samurai
are here, we're finished.

974
02:08:02,718 --> 02:08:05,888
I'll kill them.
The mountain's my territory.

975
02:08:06,180 --> 02:08:07,222
I was just —

976
02:08:07,389 --> 02:08:11,185
Enough. You can make up for it
by getting one.

977
02:08:11,352 --> 02:08:12,728
Head them off at —

978
02:08:12,895 --> 02:08:15,773
I know, at their horses.
Take us there.

979
02:08:16,899 --> 02:08:18,525
Katsushiro!

980
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:21,904
Just watch, you understand?

981
02:08:28,952 --> 02:08:31,163
Those are some horses!

982
02:08:35,959 --> 02:08:37,878
Wait in this hollow.

983
02:08:46,762 --> 02:08:49,473
- What do you plan to do?
- Who, me?

984
02:10:49,885 --> 02:10:52,054
Katsushiro.

985
02:10:52,888 --> 02:10:55,098
You can come out now.

986
02:10:58,393 --> 02:11:00,270
Help me!

987
02:11:19,331 --> 02:11:21,083
Back off!

988
02:11:22,376 --> 02:11:26,672
He's a captive who has confessed.
He's begging for his life.

989
02:11:26,838 --> 02:11:30,300
You can't just
chop him to pieces.

990
02:11:31,593 --> 02:11:32,844
Stay out of this!

991
02:11:34,596 --> 02:11:36,807
Let me do it! Scum!

992
02:11:54,866 --> 02:11:56,660
All right.

993
02:11:57,119 --> 02:11:59,788
Let her avenge her son's death.

994
02:12:02,082 --> 02:12:04,835
Someone help her!

995
02:12:05,002 --> 02:12:06,628
I'll do it!

996
02:12:15,470 --> 02:12:19,266
- That bandit said their fort —
- It's hardly a fort.

997
02:12:19,433 --> 02:12:23,312
It's full of holes,
like Yohei's underwear.

998
02:12:23,478 --> 02:12:25,814
- Easy to sneak in.
- Let's attack at night.

999
02:12:25,981 --> 02:12:29,568
They have 40 men.
We'd usually pick off a few first.

1000
02:12:29,735 --> 02:12:32,696
Wait. We can't afford
to lose a single man,

1001
02:12:32,863 --> 02:12:35,324
even if we kill five
for every one lost.

1002
02:12:35,490 --> 02:12:40,037
- War is always a gamble.
- Three of us can take 10 of them.

1003
02:12:41,038 --> 02:12:42,581
Rikichi.

1004
02:12:42,748 --> 02:12:45,709
How far away is their hideout?

1005
02:12:45,876 --> 02:12:47,377
At least a day.

1006
02:12:47,544 --> 02:12:50,380
Hey, we've got
three of their horses.

1007
02:12:50,547 --> 02:12:52,674
Half a day by horse.

1008
02:13:04,686 --> 02:13:06,313
Very well. Let's do it.

1009
02:13:06,480 --> 02:13:09,441
If we leave now,
we'll arrive before dawn.

1010
02:13:09,608 --> 02:13:11,360
But who should go?

1011
02:13:14,529 --> 02:13:15,697
Not you.

1012
02:13:18,408 --> 02:13:20,744
And me makes three.

1013
02:13:21,620 --> 02:13:23,538
They need a guide!

1014
02:13:23,705 --> 02:13:26,124
There aren't enough horses.

1015
02:13:26,291 --> 02:13:28,377
There's Yohei's horse.
You ride that.

1016
02:13:28,543 --> 02:13:30,754
The only man
to master that steed

1017
02:13:30,921 --> 02:13:32,547
is Lord Kikuchiyo himself.

1018
02:13:41,598 --> 02:13:43,809
Whoa! What the hell?

1019
02:13:44,643 --> 02:13:46,853
It's the other way!

1020
02:13:49,272 --> 02:13:51,149
Stupid horse!

1021
02:13:51,775 --> 02:13:55,737
This way, you useless mule!

1022
02:13:56,488 --> 02:13:59,074
You call yourself a horse?

1023
02:13:59,241 --> 02:14:01,410
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

1024
02:14:03,286 --> 02:14:05,122
Hey, wait!

1025
02:14:07,416 --> 02:14:11,253
Please stop! I apologize!

1026
02:14:11,420 --> 02:14:12,921
I'm sorry!

1027
02:15:39,466 --> 02:15:41,927
Hey, let's set the place on fire!

1028
02:15:42,093 --> 02:15:44,012
Cut 'em down as they run out!

1029
02:18:18,333 --> 02:18:20,335
Serves you right!

1030
02:18:20,961 --> 02:18:22,712
We did it!

1031
02:18:25,173 --> 02:18:27,133
Take that, you sons of bitches!

1032
02:19:10,135 --> 02:19:11,469
Heihachi!

1033
02:19:32,282 --> 02:19:34,617
Are you crazy?

1034
02:19:50,383 --> 02:19:51,634
Stupid idiot!

1035
02:19:51,801 --> 02:19:55,055
Look what you've done!
Who is she to you?

1036
02:19:56,431 --> 02:19:58,767
She's my wife!

1037
02:20:02,353 --> 02:20:05,106
Heihachi, hang on!

1038
02:20:44,312 --> 02:20:45,980
You said...

1039
02:20:47,941 --> 02:20:50,985
he'd be a treasure
in hard times.

1040
02:20:52,737 --> 02:20:55,115
The hard times
have only just begun.

1041
02:21:05,208 --> 02:21:06,501
Stop crying!

1042
02:21:07,168 --> 02:21:09,254
Damn fool!

1043
02:21:10,505 --> 02:21:12,173
Stop crying!

1044
02:22:40,053 --> 02:22:42,180
Goddamn!
Here they come!

1045
02:23:55,378 --> 02:23:59,173
Take note:
They have three muskets.

1046
02:24:24,824 --> 02:24:27,035
Twenty riders bound north,
13 south.

1047
02:24:27,201 --> 02:24:29,370
- Muskets?
- Three in all.

1048
02:24:30,538 --> 02:24:33,541
Take the south, and watch out
for those muskets.

1049
02:25:29,847 --> 02:25:32,183
Retreat! Retreat!

1050
02:25:47,782 --> 02:25:51,327
- The 12 headed south have turned east.
- Wasn't that 13?

1051
02:25:51,536 --> 02:25:53,496
An arrow got one of them.

1052
02:25:53,663 --> 02:25:55,248
Good old Gorobei.

1053
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:01,295
Make sure the eastern bridge is out,
and watch out for —

1054
02:26:01,462 --> 02:26:03,005
The muskets!

1055
02:26:12,056 --> 02:26:15,643
Take the north.
That's where we'll battle it out.

1056
02:26:16,602 --> 02:26:20,064
If you knew that, why didn't
you build a fence there too?

1057
02:26:20,231 --> 02:26:22,650
Every great castle
needs a breach.

1058
02:26:22,817 --> 02:26:27,113
Draw the enemy there and attack.
You can't win by defense alone.

1059
02:26:38,833 --> 02:26:41,002
Use your balls,
if you've got any!

1060
02:26:45,089 --> 02:26:47,633
Take it away, damn it!

1061
02:26:51,179 --> 02:26:53,890
Twelve riders are on the way.
Hurry with the bridge!

1062
02:26:54,098 --> 02:26:56,809
Are you blind?
What do you think we're doing?

1063
02:26:58,728 --> 02:27:01,147
And he said
to watch out for the muskets.

1064
02:27:01,314 --> 02:27:03,357
What kinda idiot
you take me for?

1065
02:27:09,947 --> 02:27:11,324
Where are you going?

1066
02:27:11,491 --> 02:27:14,327
We're looking for Father.
We can't find him anywhere.

1067
02:27:14,619 --> 02:27:19,207
Father intends to die in that barn.
That's what he's always wanted.

1068
02:27:24,921 --> 02:27:27,089
Stubborn old fool!

1069
02:27:27,590 --> 02:27:29,800
Hurry up and get him!

1070
02:27:33,387 --> 02:27:35,431
Get out of our way!

1071
02:27:36,390 --> 02:27:39,727
What are you doing?
Hurry up!

1072
02:28:01,499 --> 02:28:03,834
- On this mountain —
- Twenty riders.

1073
02:28:04,252 --> 02:28:06,837
And 12 to the east.

1074
02:28:07,004 --> 02:28:08,422
Right.

1075
02:28:24,230 --> 02:28:27,358
This won't do.
They're all scared stiff.

1076
02:28:31,195 --> 02:28:32,780
Good! Again!

1077
02:28:34,365 --> 02:28:35,950
Again!

1078
02:28:39,245 --> 02:28:42,456
Shichiroji's at it.
Let's fire ours up too.

1079
02:28:43,958 --> 02:28:45,668
Everybody out here!

1080
02:28:50,923 --> 02:28:53,426
Raise your spears
and give the battle cry.

1081
02:28:58,055 --> 02:28:59,055
Again!

1082
02:29:03,311 --> 02:29:06,272
Damn 'em, listen to that!
We can beat 'em!

1083
02:29:10,151 --> 02:29:12,820
Yohei, what's that look for?
Again!

1084
02:29:17,992 --> 02:29:19,952
Take cover!

1085
02:29:24,665 --> 02:29:26,542
Here they come!

1086
02:29:43,184 --> 02:29:44,602
Goddamn 'em!

1087
02:30:20,888 --> 02:30:24,016
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

1088
02:30:28,396 --> 02:30:30,606
Oh, no, you don't!

1089
02:30:35,403 --> 02:30:36,987
Don't panic!

1090
02:30:45,913 --> 02:30:48,332
Goddamn you!

1091
02:30:52,420 --> 02:30:53,879
They're burning!

1092
02:30:54,255 --> 02:30:56,173
Damn bastards!

1093
02:31:25,953 --> 02:31:29,039
Back to your posts, everyone!

1094
02:31:30,207 --> 02:31:31,917
Dear!

1095
02:31:33,836 --> 02:31:36,589
They're just rickety shacks!

1096
02:31:39,508 --> 02:31:42,511
Everybody, back to your posts!

1097
02:31:53,981 --> 02:31:55,524
Goddamn it!

1098
02:31:57,234 --> 02:31:58,986
You dogs!

1099
02:31:59,236 --> 02:32:01,822
That's the Old Man's house!

1100
02:32:04,366 --> 02:32:07,077
Where's the Old Man?
What about that couple?

1101
02:32:07,536 --> 02:32:10,539
And the little brat?
What the hell's going on?

1102
02:32:13,626 --> 02:32:16,587
Stop!
You can't abandon your post!

1103
02:32:18,506 --> 02:32:20,591
Kikuchiyo, come back!

1104
02:32:22,676 --> 02:32:24,178
Kikuchiyo!

1105
02:32:39,360 --> 02:32:42,154
Where's the Old Man
and your husband?

1106
02:32:52,122 --> 02:32:55,084
She's been speared.
How'd she make it this far?

1107
02:33:01,549 --> 02:33:03,467
Let's go!

1108
02:33:10,057 --> 02:33:12,184
Damn it, what is it now?

1109
02:33:15,396 --> 02:33:18,065
This baby... is me.

1110
02:33:18,566 --> 02:33:21,068
This is just
what happened to me!

1111
02:34:29,845 --> 02:34:31,764
Here we go!

1112
02:34:40,481 --> 02:34:42,566
What the hell?

1113
02:34:56,830 --> 02:34:59,333
What the hell
were you staring at?

1114
02:35:00,501 --> 02:35:02,086
Idiot!

1115
02:36:04,398 --> 02:36:06,442
No one wounded?

1116
02:36:06,817 --> 02:36:09,278
Good.
You did a fine job.

1117
02:36:09,445 --> 02:36:11,113
Fine job!

1118
02:36:14,450 --> 02:36:16,702
Gunpowder!
Take cover!

1119
02:36:27,212 --> 02:36:28,922
Manzo!

1120
02:36:42,686 --> 02:36:44,646
Where were you hit?

1121
02:36:45,147 --> 02:36:48,317
Shino! Shino!
Bring me my daughter.

1122
02:36:49,526 --> 02:36:50,944
Don't bother.

1123
02:36:51,320 --> 02:36:54,239
If this kills you,
you'd die of a fleabite.

1124
02:36:55,449 --> 02:36:58,035
You make a ruckus
over a little scratch

1125
02:36:58,202 --> 02:37:02,081
and blow your daughter's cover
in the process. Nice going!

1126
02:37:31,443 --> 02:37:33,695
You don't have
to chase them all down.

1127
02:37:37,157 --> 02:37:39,201
That's far enough.
Well done.

1128
02:37:39,952 --> 02:37:41,870
Who are you?

1129
02:37:43,747 --> 02:37:45,499
Rikichi.

1130
02:38:00,472 --> 02:38:03,016
They've attacked from the east,
west and south

1131
02:38:03,183 --> 02:38:06,145
and run away each time
with their tails between their legs.

1132
02:38:06,311 --> 02:38:08,063
This is the only approach left.

1133
02:38:08,230 --> 02:38:10,858
We don't know
if they'll come tonight,

1134
02:38:11,024 --> 02:38:13,152
but when they do,
they'll mass their forces here.

1135
02:38:13,318 --> 02:38:15,028
Perhaps, but...

1136
02:38:15,696 --> 02:38:17,781
I don't hear a thing.

1137
02:38:30,878 --> 02:38:32,588
Nevertheless,

1138
02:38:33,338 --> 02:38:35,674
this will surely
be the focus of their attack.

1139
02:38:36,091 --> 02:38:38,051
I'll prove it to you in a minute.

1140
02:39:22,054 --> 02:39:23,430
Good work.

1141
02:39:23,597 --> 02:39:26,642
Now poke that scarecrow out
from behind those trees.

1142
02:40:01,176 --> 02:40:04,304
I'd say tomorrow morning

1143
02:40:04,596 --> 02:40:07,099
they'll attack us here
with everything they've got.

1144
02:40:07,266 --> 02:40:10,185
And we'll let them in.

1145
02:40:14,106 --> 02:40:17,276
Don't worry.
I mean we'll let one in.

1146
02:40:18,318 --> 02:40:20,320
Two at most.

1147
02:40:21,321 --> 02:40:24,992
Once they're in,
we form a wall again with our spears.

1148
02:40:25,701 --> 02:40:28,578
The one or two who get in
are as good as dead.

1149
02:40:28,745 --> 02:40:30,831
We can cook 'em up
any way we want.

1150
02:40:33,083 --> 02:40:37,671
We'll pick them off patiently,
one by one, until the final showdown.

1151
02:40:37,838 --> 02:40:39,881
Those muskets worry me.

1152
02:40:40,048 --> 02:40:42,217
If only we could
get one of them.

1153
02:40:44,803 --> 02:40:48,181
I'll go.
I swear I'll get one!

1154
02:40:48,348 --> 02:40:51,268
No. You're looking to die.
I'll go.

1155
02:41:44,404 --> 02:41:46,323
Footsteps! Listen!

1156
02:41:46,490 --> 02:41:49,743
That's enough.
Get some rest.

1157
02:41:49,910 --> 02:41:52,913
It's true! I hear them!
Listen.

1158
02:41:53,080 --> 02:41:55,207
I said enough.

1159
02:41:56,083 --> 02:41:59,211
You're exhausted.
Get some rest.

1160
02:42:01,963 --> 02:42:03,673
I hear them.

1161
02:42:31,827 --> 02:42:33,578
Two more down.

1162
02:43:08,572 --> 02:43:09,781
What is it?

1163
02:43:12,868 --> 02:43:16,997
State your business.
I'm going to get some sleep.

1164
02:43:18,457 --> 02:43:21,960
You are a magnificent person.

1165
02:43:26,339 --> 02:43:30,385
I've wanted to tell you so
for some time.

1166
02:43:56,369 --> 02:43:58,121
They're here.

1167
02:44:02,209 --> 02:44:04,211
We'll let one in.

1168
02:44:07,005 --> 02:44:08,965
We're letting one in!

1169
02:44:16,389 --> 02:44:20,894
Remember, after the first one's in,
jump out with your spears.

1170
02:44:39,788 --> 02:44:41,039
Here they come.

1171
02:45:16,992 --> 02:45:18,743
Step aside!

1172
02:45:21,288 --> 02:45:22,831
Good work.

1173
02:45:30,547 --> 02:45:33,633
What's wrong? You did well.

1174
02:45:34,134 --> 02:45:36,052
Here he comes! Scatter!

1175
02:45:53,612 --> 02:45:55,822
Fall back! Fall back!

1176
02:46:01,453 --> 02:46:03,538
After them!

1177
02:46:11,838 --> 02:46:13,506
Another on the way!

1178
02:47:55,817 --> 02:47:57,569
Here he comes.

1179
02:48:13,793 --> 02:48:15,628
Watch this!

1180
02:48:21,551 --> 02:48:24,262
Having fun with your horsey?

1181
02:48:46,034 --> 02:48:50,580
They've stopped.
Won't fall for that trick again, eh?

1182
02:48:59,506 --> 02:49:02,675
They're all wimps!
Who's scared of bandits anyway?

1183
02:49:09,599 --> 02:49:14,854
That little skirmish just cost them four.
Kyuzo got two last night.

1184
02:49:31,454 --> 02:49:33,706
That man is a true samurai.

1185
02:49:34,040 --> 02:49:36,709
He's fearless,
his swordsmanship is amazing,

1186
02:49:36,876 --> 02:49:38,586
and yet he's kind too.

1187
02:49:38,753 --> 02:49:42,465
He never once boasted
about capturing that musket.

1188
02:49:42,882 --> 02:49:47,387
He walked into a forest filled with bandits
as if on a mushroom hunt.

1189
02:49:48,763 --> 02:49:53,059
Fascinating.
I'm not bored at all, I swear.

1190
02:50:10,910 --> 02:50:12,829
Hey, Yohei.

1191
02:50:13,705 --> 02:50:15,248
Take over for me.

1192
02:50:18,376 --> 02:50:21,421
What's that face for?

1193
02:50:21,588 --> 02:50:23,756
There's no danger here now.

1194
02:50:25,341 --> 02:50:27,510
You make a great scarecrow.

1195
02:51:58,977 --> 02:52:00,269
Hear me good!

1196
02:52:01,354 --> 02:52:03,731
If anybody else turns yellow —

1197
02:52:09,904 --> 02:52:11,280
Out of my way!

1198
02:53:34,781 --> 02:53:36,032
Hey!

1199
02:53:39,786 --> 02:53:40,953
How's it goin'?

1200
02:53:41,120 --> 02:53:43,164
Man, they're a pain.

1201
02:53:43,456 --> 02:53:45,583
Won't be long now.

1202
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:49,253
Everything's upside down.

1203
02:53:49,462 --> 02:53:53,299
They burn us out,
and we starve like farmers.

1204
02:53:54,133 --> 02:53:56,969
Quit your moaning.
There are better times ahead.

1205
02:53:57,136 --> 02:53:59,472
Do your part, man.

1206
02:54:39,178 --> 02:54:41,347
Hey, it's me!

1207
02:54:48,604 --> 02:54:50,356
Serves you right, you dogs!

1208
02:54:50,523 --> 02:54:51,524
Fool!

1209
02:54:52,692 --> 02:54:54,694
Why did you leave your post?

1210
02:54:54,861 --> 02:54:56,237
Just look at this!

1211
02:54:56,404 --> 02:55:00,032
Don't scold me, man.
My post is fine.

1212
02:55:00,867 --> 02:55:04,412
There's nothing heroic
about selfishly grabbing for glory.

1213
02:55:04,579 --> 02:55:08,791
Listen to me:
War is not fought alone!

1214
02:55:19,177 --> 02:55:22,221
Gorobei and Kyuzo,
guard this post!

1215
02:55:27,602 --> 02:55:29,645
Let no one pass!

1216
02:57:37,565 --> 02:57:40,359
Stop, you asses!

1217
02:57:40,526 --> 02:57:42,236
Damn you!

1218
02:57:42,862 --> 02:57:44,864
Damn it! Two made it in!

1219
02:58:00,546 --> 02:58:03,591
Goddamn it!

1220
02:58:04,300 --> 02:58:05,885
Where's Yohei?

1221
02:58:45,883 --> 02:58:47,218
Yohei!

1222
02:58:48,844 --> 02:58:50,262
Yohei!

1223
02:58:50,763 --> 02:58:53,891
I defended my post.

1224
02:58:54,058 --> 02:58:56,727
Don't give up, Yohei!

1225
02:59:00,106 --> 02:59:01,941
Go ahead, shoot me!

1226
02:59:39,979 --> 02:59:41,689
Shichiroji, take over!

1227
02:59:52,950 --> 02:59:54,827
Gorobei!

1228
03:00:04,503 --> 03:00:06,505
Gorobei!

1229
03:00:58,432 --> 03:01:00,726
Just 13 left.

1230
03:01:01,310 --> 03:01:03,354
But these last seven...

1231
03:01:04,605 --> 03:01:06,732
came at a steep price.

1232
03:01:27,920 --> 03:01:30,589
How are you? Tired?

1233
03:01:32,508 --> 03:01:36,428
Poor man.
You've lost a lot of weight.

1234
03:01:40,599 --> 03:01:43,143
I'll go throw
some water on my face.

1235
03:01:53,737 --> 03:01:56,448
Next time they come,
we fight to the finish.

1236
03:01:56,615 --> 03:02:00,869
It's better we fight it out
before we're spent.

1237
03:02:01,120 --> 03:02:04,665
When do you think
they'll attack?

1238
03:02:06,083 --> 03:02:09,086
They're exhausted too,
and a few are wounded.

1239
03:02:09,503 --> 03:02:11,630
They won't come tonight.

1240
03:02:11,797 --> 03:02:17,011
But they have no food,
and their ranks are splitting.

1241
03:02:17,928 --> 03:02:20,014
They can't afford
to dawdle either.

1242
03:02:20,264 --> 03:02:26,437
I say they'll come at us like hell
tomorrow morning.

1243
03:02:27,813 --> 03:02:29,481
Katsushiro.

1244
03:02:48,959 --> 03:02:50,461
An order from above.

1245
03:02:50,628 --> 03:02:53,797
Place two on watch
and let the rest sleep.

1246
03:02:54,506 --> 03:02:58,510
The men may visit their families
one at a time.

1247
03:03:00,304 --> 03:03:01,847
So tomorrow's the showdown?

1248
03:03:03,849 --> 03:03:06,060
Yes.
Please carry out the order.

1249
03:03:12,775 --> 03:03:16,570
You all heard what he just said.

1250
03:03:20,574 --> 03:03:22,993
I'll stand guard.

1251
03:03:23,619 --> 03:03:25,496
The rest of you sleep.

1252
03:03:26,538 --> 03:03:29,708
Manzo...

1253
03:03:30,501 --> 03:03:32,544
you go home first.

1254
03:03:32,961 --> 03:03:35,381
Take a good look
at your daughter —

1255
03:03:36,173 --> 03:03:38,425
I mean, your son.

1256
03:03:47,434 --> 03:03:48,727
I told them.

1257
03:03:48,894 --> 03:03:51,063
All right. Get some rest.

1258
03:03:55,109 --> 03:03:57,444
Katsushiro.

1259
03:03:58,404 --> 03:03:59,947
How was Kikuchiyo?

1260
03:04:00,114 --> 03:04:03,200
Still beside the grave.

1261
03:04:03,450 --> 03:04:04,743
I see.

1262
03:05:18,066 --> 03:05:20,903
Are we all going
to die tomorrow?

1263
03:05:21,069 --> 03:05:24,156
There's no way to know.

1264
03:05:24,782 --> 03:05:27,326
But we might!

1265
03:05:49,556 --> 03:05:50,974
Shino.

1266
03:05:51,600 --> 03:05:53,268
Where's Shino?

1267
03:05:58,941 --> 03:06:00,526
Anyone seen Shino?

1268
03:06:34,977 --> 03:06:37,563
Sake, eh?
Where'd you find it?

1269
03:06:52,870 --> 03:06:55,914
I see. They have stockpiles,
just like Kikuchiyo said,

1270
03:06:56,081 --> 03:06:58,083
and tonight it all comes out.

1271
03:07:07,467 --> 03:07:10,095
I think I'll help myself.

1272
03:07:13,807 --> 03:07:15,392
Shino!

1273
03:07:41,168 --> 03:07:44,254
Here's some sake.
Drink up and get some sleep.

1274
03:07:49,509 --> 03:07:53,805
This is hardly like you.
You must rest for the battle tomorrow.

1275
03:08:05,359 --> 03:08:07,444
Shino!

1276
03:09:12,592 --> 03:09:14,469
<i>You tramp!</i>

1277
03:09:23,937 --> 03:09:27,024
You wench!

1278
03:09:30,902 --> 03:09:33,071
Stop this brutality!

1279
03:09:33,238 --> 03:09:37,576
What the hell's a farmer girl
doing with a samurai?

1280
03:10:03,018 --> 03:10:04,686
You slut!

1281
03:10:14,821 --> 03:10:16,406
Manzo.

1282
03:10:17,282 --> 03:10:19,785
Is this your daughter?

1283
03:10:26,249 --> 03:10:28,126
Tell me what happened.

1284
03:10:28,293 --> 03:10:32,631
You mentioned a samurai.
Who was it?

1285
03:10:34,216 --> 03:10:35,759
Manzo!

1286
03:10:45,477 --> 03:10:47,312
Manzo, say something.

1287
03:10:48,396 --> 03:10:49,981
Speak!

1288
03:11:22,347 --> 03:11:24,516
Are you Shino?

1289
03:11:43,743 --> 03:11:46,955
Manzo, don't be angry.

1290
03:11:48,415 --> 03:11:51,501
When the dawn threatens
our very lives,

1291
03:11:51,668 --> 03:11:55,005
the weight of it
makes us all a little reckless.

1292
03:12:00,844 --> 03:12:03,388
On the eve of decisive battles...

1293
03:12:04,931 --> 03:12:07,684
this often happens,
even inside castles.

1294
03:12:10,562 --> 03:12:14,608
Remember what it was to be young.
You can't blame them.

1295
03:12:15,567 --> 03:12:17,652
I can't forgive them.

1296
03:12:17,903 --> 03:12:21,072
I can't stand by when my only daughter
has been made damaged goods.

1297
03:12:35,629 --> 03:12:40,258
What's wrong with two people in love?
It's not like bandits took her!

1298
03:14:12,684 --> 03:14:16,938
They're wound up tight.
We need to loosen them up.

1299
03:14:25,030 --> 03:14:28,283
Everyone, the final battle
is here at last.

1300
03:14:31,286 --> 03:14:35,540
By the way, Katsushiro,
we expect much of you today.

1301
03:14:37,292 --> 03:14:40,378
As of last night,
you became a real man.

1302
03:14:58,396 --> 03:14:59,939
Hey!

1303
03:15:02,901 --> 03:15:06,029
Where's that fighting spirit?

1304
03:15:07,781 --> 03:15:11,368
You'll never win
with such long faces!

1305
03:15:24,923 --> 03:15:27,092
Kikuchiyo, what are you up to?

1306
03:15:27,258 --> 03:15:29,594
I can't kill five
with just one blade.

1307
03:15:45,276 --> 03:15:47,195
There are 13 left.

1308
03:15:48,363 --> 03:15:52,325
We'll let them all in.

1309
03:15:53,910 --> 03:15:56,329
Once they pass this point,

1310
03:15:56,830 --> 03:16:00,708
we close in from all sides
at the crossing.

1311
03:16:03,628 --> 03:16:07,757
Everything's riding
on this battle!

1312
03:16:38,037 --> 03:16:40,290
Here they come!

1313
03:17:03,605 --> 03:17:05,857
Here they come!

1314
03:17:30,298 --> 03:17:32,509
Shichiroji and Katsushiro,
go west!

1315
03:17:32,759 --> 03:17:35,053
Kyuzo, Kikuchiyo, east!

1316
03:19:16,529 --> 03:19:19,490
Katsushiro! Rikichi!

1317
03:19:19,657 --> 03:19:22,327
East! Go east!

1318
03:19:22,493 --> 03:19:24,370
East!

1319
03:19:41,429 --> 03:19:43,222
Shut up!

1320
03:19:43,681 --> 03:19:45,892
Scream and you're dead!

1321
03:20:33,272 --> 03:20:34,482
We did it!

1322
03:20:34,649 --> 03:20:35,983
We did it!

1323
03:20:36,150 --> 03:20:38,903
Head east!

1324
03:20:54,252 --> 03:20:56,629
Katsushiro, pull back!

1325
03:20:59,132 --> 03:21:01,384
Damn you!

1326
03:21:03,094 --> 03:21:04,554
Kikuchiyo!

1327
03:21:40,715 --> 03:21:42,842
Kikuchiyo!

1328
03:21:53,227 --> 03:21:56,314
Where are the bandits?

1329
03:21:56,481 --> 03:21:58,483
They're all dead!

1330
03:22:16,793 --> 03:22:19,629
Once more we survive.

1331
03:25:57,805 --> 03:26:01,517
In the end,
we lost this battle too.

1332
03:26:02,393 --> 03:26:03,644
What?

1333
03:26:04,478 --> 03:26:06,105
I mean,

1334
03:26:06,480 --> 03:26:09,066
the victory belongs to those peasants.

1335
03:26:10,359 --> 03:26:12,194
Not to us.

1336
03:26:41,432 --> 03:26:46,312
THE END
