17
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:15,507
In the 16th century, during the Civil Wars,

18
00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:20,346
an endless cycle of conflict
left the countryside overrun by bandits.

19
00:03:20,554 --> 00:03:24,641
Peaceful peasants lived in terror
of the thunder of approaching hooves...

20
00:04:08,602 --> 00:04:11,772
Take this village too?

21
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,650
Take it! Take it!

22
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:16,985
Not so fast!

23
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:21,115
We just took their rice last fall.

24
00:04:21,782 --> 00:04:23,242
They'll have nothing now.

25
00:04:23,742 --> 00:04:25,202
Very well.

26
00:04:25,411 --> 00:04:28,205
We'll return
when that barley's ripe!

27
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:03,490
Is there no god to protect us?

28
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:10,914
Land tax, forced labor,
war, drought...

29
00:05:11,582 --> 00:05:14,293
and now bandits!

30
00:05:18,714 --> 00:05:22,384
The gods want us farmers dead!

31
00:05:22,593 --> 00:05:25,304
That's right!
We're better off dead!

32
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:31,226
What's all this?
Crying won't change anything.

33
00:05:31,685 --> 00:05:34,563
The magistrate can do more
than collect taxes.

34
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,565
We can ask him for help.

35
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:39,526
We know all about him!

36
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:43,072
He shows up after they're gone,
acting big while he surveys the damage.

37
00:05:43,238 --> 00:05:45,366
That's right. He's useless.

38
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:50,871
We might as well hand over
our rice and barley to the bandits

39
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,332
and just hang ourselves!

40
00:05:53,874 --> 00:05:57,252
That'll bring the magistrate
here in a hurry!

41
00:06:07,888 --> 00:06:09,556
We'll kill those bandits.

42
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:12,559
We'll kill them all.

43
00:06:12,768 --> 00:06:14,812
Never again!
Let's kill 'em all!

44
00:06:15,604 --> 00:06:17,064
Not me!

45
00:06:18,607 --> 00:06:20,943
I couldn't possibly --

46
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,030
That's crazy talk.

47
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,244
So we can kill defeated samurai
but not bandits?

48
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:34,248
Stop it! This is no time
to fight amongst ourselves.

49
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:41,422
We don't have a chance against bandits.
And when we lose?

50
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,967
They'll slaughter us all,
down to the last unborn child.

51
00:06:45,134 --> 00:06:48,595
I've had enough!
Better to risk it all

52
00:06:48,804 --> 00:06:51,432
than to live like this.
Kill or be killed!

53
00:06:51,682 --> 00:06:53,100
Rikichi!

54
00:06:53,517 --> 00:06:56,270
The farmer's only choice
is to endure.

55
00:06:56,562 --> 00:06:58,605
We can't defy the powerful.

56
00:07:00,315 --> 00:07:03,152
When the bandits arrive,
we'll greet them meekly

57
00:07:03,986 --> 00:07:06,155
and quietly hand over
all our barley.

58
00:07:06,655 --> 00:07:11,201
We'll plead with them to leave
just enough for us to survive.

59
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,790
" That's all we ask, "
we'll beg on our hands and knees.

60
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:20,711
What bandit will agree to that?

61
00:07:21,128 --> 00:07:26,258
Have you forgotten how low we had
to stoop for the rice we're eating now?

62
00:07:47,696 --> 00:07:49,782
We should go see the Old Man.

63
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,368
Let him decide what to do.

64
00:08:57,975 --> 00:09:00,144
<i>Consider who
we're dealing with here. </i>

65
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:05,774
<i>Give a wolf a taste of your leg
and he'll ask for your hand. </i>

66
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:08,736
<i>Once they have a taste,
they'll be back in the fall. </i>

67
00:09:08,986 --> 00:09:12,239
<i>- But what if we lose?
- Then we're no worse off!</i>

68
00:09:12,823 --> 00:09:15,784
<i>Without our barley,
we're doomed anyway!</i>

69
00:09:20,956 --> 00:09:22,166
We fight.

70
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:26,086
Old Man, that's madness.

71
00:09:26,295 --> 00:09:28,756
We're farmers.
What do we know of battle?

72
00:09:28,964 --> 00:09:31,467
We'll hire samurai.

73
00:09:31,842 --> 00:09:35,971
Whoever heard of farmers
hiring samurai?

74
00:09:37,598 --> 00:09:40,309
I saw it with my own eyes,

75
00:09:41,352 --> 00:09:46,565
when the village you were born in
was torched.

76
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:51,779
I saw it when we escaped
to this village here.

77
00:09:52,988 --> 00:09:59,870
The only village that didn't burn
was the one that hired samurai.

78
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:03,874
But Old Man, there are
different kinds of villages and villagers.

79
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,585
How are we to feed samurai
when we live on rice gruel?

80
00:10:06,794 --> 00:10:07,961
We'll make do on millet!

81
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,508
Show me a samurai who'll fight
for farmers in return for food!

82
00:10:12,675 --> 00:10:14,677
They're a proud lot.

83
00:10:14,885 --> 00:10:15,928
Look.

84
00:10:17,137 --> 00:10:20,849
Find hungry samurai.

85
00:10:22,184 --> 00:10:27,856
Even bears come down from
the mountains when they're hungry.

86
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,111
How dare you?

87
00:11:15,696 --> 00:11:19,033
You're nothing but a farmer!
I'm still a samurai!

88
00:11:19,241 --> 00:11:21,035
I don't need your charity!

89
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:25,748
Fool!

90
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:34,673
What'd I tell you?

91
00:12:07,748 --> 00:12:09,708
Look, the barley's ripe.

92
00:12:10,793 --> 00:12:12,878
Ten days already
since we left the village.

93
00:12:13,087 --> 00:12:15,464
What do we do?

94
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:21,011
This barley's early,
not like our mountain barley.

95
00:12:23,806 --> 00:12:27,434
Hey, we're soaked through
to the bone.

96
00:12:27,643 --> 00:12:31,271
Find any cheap, strong
and foolhardy samurai?

97
00:13:10,352 --> 00:13:12,312
Leftovers.

98
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:13,939
You can have 'em cheap.

99
00:13:14,148 --> 00:13:15,399
That's a laugh!

100
00:13:16,358 --> 00:13:18,986
- What's so funny?
- He's blind.

101
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:22,906
- What about you, then?
- Not me.

102
00:13:23,115 --> 00:13:25,451
I'd rather eat horseshit.

103
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:34,001
- Won't get a nose bleed outta him.
- Cleaned him out gambling last night.

104
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:38,047
Pulled his sword when he lost,
so the three of us beat him up.

105
00:13:38,213 --> 00:13:40,632
Not a drop left in his nose now.

106
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:47,973
Don't bother.
They only eat millet.

107
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:51,226
Is that true?
You can't live like that.

108
00:13:51,435 --> 00:13:54,355
Without nourishment
you'll go night-blind.

109
00:13:54,646 --> 00:13:56,440
I've got just four left.

110
00:13:56,648 --> 00:13:59,276
I'll trade 'em all
for a cup of rice.

111
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,445
What do you say?

112
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:06,825
Damn! What a bunch.

113
00:14:25,469 --> 00:14:28,097
What a waste.

114
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:33,268
If we still had that rice,
we coulda bought 40 of those.

115
00:14:33,477 --> 00:14:34,353
Shut up!

116
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,398
But it's true, right?

117
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:41,485
The blockhead's cracking up!

118
00:14:42,152 --> 00:14:44,446
What a show.
Go at it, boys.

119
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:53,998
Who ever heard
of anything so unfair?

120
00:14:55,582 --> 00:15:01,422
We give him his fill of rice
and a free bottle of sake,

121
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:05,592
and he thanks us
with a beating.

122
00:15:07,094 --> 00:15:09,096
Good for him!

123
00:15:09,471 --> 00:15:12,266
Not like this one
playing possum here.

124
00:15:12,641 --> 00:15:17,813
Say, let's go home.
Let's just go home.

125
00:15:19,982 --> 00:15:21,358
Look at him sobbing.

126
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:23,235
Misses his wifey.

127
00:15:23,444 --> 00:15:26,488
I'd pay good money
to watch the two of 'em going at it.

128
00:15:26,697 --> 00:15:31,285
Let's hurry
and get back to the village.

129
00:15:31,493 --> 00:15:34,955
Go on home. You can't afford buns,
let alone samurai.

130
00:15:35,664 --> 00:15:40,002
Farmers like us know
good from bad when it comes to seed,

131
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,005
but not when it comes
to samurai.

132
00:15:44,673 --> 00:15:49,011
Besides, we're no match
for the tough ones,

133
00:15:50,012 --> 00:15:55,642
and the only ones interested
are weaklings.

134
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:08,530
If I lost last night,
it was only because I was starving.

135
00:16:09,698 --> 00:16:13,494
Liar! You had plenty
of money to gamble.

136
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:15,871
Jerk!

137
00:16:16,038 --> 00:16:17,581
Wanna fight?

138
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,751
It's a fight.

139
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:26,548
Over here!
Wake up!

140
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:39,728
Quit that strumming, monk!
It's depressing!

141
00:16:40,604 --> 00:16:43,732
Keep it up, grandpa.
We're on your side.

142
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,390
Rikichi!

143
00:17:17,266 --> 00:17:18,809
Stop it, Manzo!

144
00:17:19,268 --> 00:17:22,229
You said we were going home,
you son of a bitch!

145
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:26,150
I said we'd go home,
not bargain with bandits!

146
00:17:26,942 --> 00:17:29,486
If we can't hire samurai,
what's left?

147
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:32,322
It's bargain or nothing!

148
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,909
Fine, have it your way!

149
00:17:44,626 --> 00:17:46,086
But tell me:

150
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,340
If we do strike a bargain,

151
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:51,759
what have we got
to offer this year?

152
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:54,762
Are you willing to give 'em
your daughter?

153
00:17:56,722 --> 00:17:58,682
Shino's a fine-Iookin' girl.

154
00:19:30,774 --> 00:19:32,401
What's going on?

155
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:37,531
There's a thief in that barn.
We raised a ruckus and he ran in to hide.

156
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,056
How many thieves are there?

157
00:20:02,264 --> 00:20:03,307
Just one.

158
00:20:03,766 --> 00:20:05,184
One?

159
00:20:06,852 --> 00:20:09,438
All of you can't take
a single thief?

160
00:20:09,646 --> 00:20:14,485
We don't dare make a move.
He took a kid in there with him.

161
00:20:14,693 --> 00:20:17,446
Says he'll kill him
if we attack.

162
00:20:18,572 --> 00:20:21,200
Listen. Hear him?

163
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,666
Poor thing.

164
00:20:28,874 --> 00:20:31,001
It all happened
in the middle of the night.

165
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,464
Poor kid's been bawling
the better part of a day.

166
00:20:35,673 --> 00:20:38,801
He can barely
make a sound now.

167
00:20:42,054 --> 00:20:46,141
He's only seven.
Imagine how his parents feel.

168
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:50,062
Who's that samurai
getting his head shaved?

169
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:54,608
No idea. We asked him for help
and he agreed right away.

170
00:20:54,817 --> 00:20:56,777
Then he asked us
for two rice balls.

171
00:20:56,985 --> 00:21:01,198
He asked a monk to shave his head
and lend him his robes.

172
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:02,950
No idea what he's up to.

173
00:22:35,751 --> 00:22:39,713
<i>Stay back!
Any closer and I kill the brat!</i>

174
00:22:39,922 --> 00:22:41,840
I'm a monk.

175
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:44,176
<i>Stay back!</i>

176
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:49,556
I'm just a monk.
I mean you no harm.

177
00:22:54,895 --> 00:22:56,355
I won't come in.

178
00:22:56,563 --> 00:23:00,651
I just thought the child
must be very hungry.

179
00:23:06,073 --> 00:23:08,242
I've brought some rice balls.

180
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:11,245
You should eat one yourself.

181
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:17,334
Won't you have one?

182
00:23:17,751 --> 00:23:18,669
What's wrong?

183
00:23:22,881 --> 00:23:24,591
<i>Throw 'em here!</i>

184
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,427
Here.

185
00:23:54,163 --> 00:23:56,373
My baby!

186
00:25:07,903 --> 00:25:10,572
Even you can't object
to a samurai like that.

187
00:25:10,781 --> 00:25:13,534
Ask him quickly.
It'll be harder in town.

188
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,677
What do you want?

189
00:25:40,602 --> 00:25:44,398
My name is Katsushiro Okamoto.
Please make me your disciple!

190
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:48,402
Disciple?

191
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:52,448
As you see, I'm a ronin.
The name is Kambei Shimada.

192
00:25:53,115 --> 00:25:55,326
I don't take on disciples.

193
00:25:55,534 --> 00:25:58,203
Get up.
I can't talk to you like this.

194
00:25:59,455 --> 00:26:01,623
I'm begging you --
let me be your disciple.

195
00:26:01,832 --> 00:26:06,670
First get off your knees.
We'll talk as we go.

196
00:26:19,016 --> 00:26:20,726
I'm at a loss.

197
00:26:20,934 --> 00:26:23,937
You think far too highly of me.

198
00:26:24,146 --> 00:26:24,897
No, sir --

199
00:26:25,105 --> 00:26:26,815
Just hear me out.

200
00:26:27,024 --> 00:26:30,152
There's nothing special
about me.

201
00:26:30,361 --> 00:26:33,614
I may have seen
my share of battle,

202
00:26:33,822 --> 00:26:36,784
but always on the losing side.

203
00:26:36,992 --> 00:26:39,745
That about sums me up.

204
00:26:39,953 --> 00:26:42,956
Better not to follow
such an unlucky man.

205
00:26:43,165 --> 00:26:48,128
No, I'm determined to follow you
whether you allow me to or not.

206
00:26:48,337 --> 00:26:49,963
I forbid it.

207
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:54,009
I don't have the means
to travel with an attendant.

208
00:27:06,355 --> 00:27:07,981
Can I help you?

209
00:27:16,198 --> 00:27:17,908
What do you want?

210
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:27,126
Insolence!

211
00:27:29,003 --> 00:27:31,088
Stay out of this, little chick.

212
00:27:34,258 --> 00:27:36,218
Are you a samurai?

213
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:42,057
Damn right I am!

214
00:27:45,102 --> 00:27:46,812
I wonder.

215
00:27:54,778 --> 00:27:56,030
Bastard.

216
00:28:12,296 --> 00:28:13,922
Who was that?

217
00:28:20,262 --> 00:28:21,847
Leave him be.

218
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:42,034
I beg of you, sir!

219
00:28:43,952 --> 00:28:47,081
You idiot.
Why don't you scram?

220
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:53,212
Stubborn old fool.
They'll eat it and run like last time.

221
00:28:58,133 --> 00:29:00,678
It will never work.

222
00:29:00,886 --> 00:29:04,348
Sir, we could arm the villagers
with bamboo spears.

223
00:29:04,556 --> 00:29:07,142
- I thought of that.
- But, sir --

224
00:29:10,854 --> 00:29:13,232
This isn't a game.

225
00:29:16,652 --> 00:29:19,279
They may be bandits,
but they ride 40 strong.

226
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:23,158
Two or three samurai
won't suffice.

227
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:40,009
Defense is more difficult
than offense.

228
00:29:42,011 --> 00:29:44,263
You say there are mountains
behind the village?

229
00:29:44,471 --> 00:29:45,264
Yes.

230
00:29:45,472 --> 00:29:47,141
Passable by horse?

231
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:48,350
Yes.

232
00:29:57,526 --> 00:29:59,820
Fields in front.

233
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:02,489
Until those are flooded
with water,

234
00:30:02,865 --> 00:30:05,909
you're open to mounted attack
on four sides.

235
00:30:07,369 --> 00:30:10,080
You need at least four men,
one to guard each side.

236
00:30:11,957 --> 00:30:14,209
Two more to guard the rear.

237
00:30:15,794 --> 00:30:18,547
No matter how frugal
our estimate,

238
00:30:19,423 --> 00:30:21,759
we need seven,
including me.

239
00:30:24,011 --> 00:30:26,263
We can manage
seven somehow.

240
00:30:26,472 --> 00:30:29,183
But the Old Man said four.

241
00:30:29,391 --> 00:30:31,018
It's only three more.

242
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,103
Hold on a second.

243
00:30:33,312 --> 00:30:37,024
I haven't accepted your offer.
I'm only speculating.

244
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:42,905
First of all, it's not easy
to find trustworthy samurai.

245
00:30:43,322 --> 00:30:48,285
What's more,
all you have to offer is food.

246
00:30:49,662 --> 00:30:53,082
Only those out to fight
for the hell of it will agree.

247
00:30:53,499 --> 00:30:57,795
Besides, I'm sick of fighting.

248
00:30:59,296 --> 00:31:00,923
Age, I suppose.

249
00:31:22,277 --> 00:31:25,364
Good thing
I wasn't born a peasant.

250
00:31:27,157 --> 00:31:30,619
Better to be born a dog.
Goddamn it.

251
00:31:30,953 --> 00:31:34,873
Go ahead -- hang yourself and die!
You're better off dead!

252
00:31:35,082 --> 00:31:36,458
Silence, you lout!

253
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:39,253
What's it to you?
I'm only telling the truth.

254
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:43,716
What truth? What the hell do you know
of these farmers' suffering?

255
00:31:43,924 --> 00:31:45,509
Don't make me laugh!

256
00:31:45,718 --> 00:31:47,386
Like you would know.

257
00:31:47,594 --> 00:31:48,429
How dare you?

258
00:31:48,637 --> 00:31:52,016
You heard right. If you know,
why don't you help them?

259
00:31:57,563 --> 00:31:59,148
So you wanna fight?

260
00:32:01,608 --> 00:32:02,943
That's enough.

261
00:32:09,283 --> 00:32:11,118
Enough!

262
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:21,712
Hey, samurai, look at this.

263
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,756
This here's your dinner.

264
00:32:23,964 --> 00:32:26,592
But what do you think
these blockheads eat?

265
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,052
Millet.

266
00:32:28,302 --> 00:32:32,306
They eat millet
to feed you white rice.

267
00:32:32,514 --> 00:32:36,018
This is the best they can offer.
What do you say to that?

268
00:32:37,811 --> 00:32:39,730
- All right, then.
- What?

269
00:32:39,938 --> 00:32:41,357
Quit your jabbering.

270
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,448
I won't let this rice go to waste.

271
00:33:06,548 --> 00:33:08,509
Manzo and the others are back!

272
00:33:23,148 --> 00:33:24,692
Where are Rikichi and Yohei?

273
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,569
They stayed behind.
We still need more samurai.

274
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:29,029
The samurai are coming?

275
00:33:29,238 --> 00:33:31,281
They sure are.
Seven of 'em.

276
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,700
Seven?

277
00:33:36,787 --> 00:33:38,247
Seven.

278
00:33:38,872 --> 00:33:43,043
I was against it
because you said four, Old Man.

279
00:33:44,712 --> 00:33:49,883
I figured we'd need
at least ten.

280
00:33:50,092 --> 00:33:55,180
But if I'd said ten,
we'd have ended up with 15.

281
00:33:56,098 --> 00:33:58,726
That's the way it goes.

282
00:34:00,102 --> 00:34:03,272
Old Man, I'm worried.

283
00:34:07,985 --> 00:34:11,572
The village girls will go crazy
over the samurai.

284
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,951
If the samurai touch 'em,
all hell will break loose.

285
00:34:19,455 --> 00:34:22,458
Bandits are coming, you fool.

286
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:26,086
Your head is on the block,

287
00:34:26,462 --> 00:34:29,715
and all you think of
are your whiskers?

288
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,517
Samurai, sir.

289
00:34:51,362 --> 00:34:54,990
- You require my services?
- Yes, sir.

290
00:34:55,574 --> 00:34:57,201
Who's to be my opponent?

291
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,120
<i>Katsushiro. </i>

292
00:35:12,174 --> 00:35:13,967
Hide just inside the door.

293
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:18,889
Strike that ronin as he enters.

294
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:25,396
Here he comes.

295
00:35:30,192 --> 00:35:33,237
Don't hold back.
Give him a real whack.

296
00:36:02,266 --> 00:36:03,851
Excellent!

297
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:08,856
Please don't take offense.
I am Kambei Shimada.

298
00:36:09,064 --> 00:36:13,527
We're seeking expert swordsmen
and have no time to waste.

299
00:36:13,736 --> 00:36:15,029
Forgive me.

300
00:36:15,738 --> 00:36:16,947
What's this about?

301
00:36:17,865 --> 00:36:19,950
The reason better be good,
or I'll have to redeem my honor.

302
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:24,621
I humbly beg your pardon.
We only sought to test your skill.

303
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:28,125
We must soon contend
with a gang of bandits.

304
00:36:29,043 --> 00:36:31,962
I see.
And whose clan do you serve?

305
00:36:32,171 --> 00:36:37,551
It pains me to tell you,
but we're fighting for farmers.

306
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,261
- Farmers?
- That's right.

307
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:42,890
This job affords
no stipend and no reward.

308
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,144
But we can eat our fill
as long as we fight.

309
00:36:47,436 --> 00:36:48,812
This is absurd!

310
00:36:49,813 --> 00:36:51,940
My ambitions
are greater than that.

311
00:36:53,609 --> 00:36:57,905
That's a shame.
Won't you reconsider?

312
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:00,157
I will not.

313
00:37:06,497 --> 00:37:11,543
Sir, we lost a good man there.
Such a fine swordsman.

314
00:37:57,673 --> 00:37:59,299
What's wrong?

315
00:37:59,508 --> 00:38:03,887
That one samurai's good,
but how'll the other six be?

316
00:38:04,096 --> 00:38:06,181
Enough of your worrying.

317
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:10,978
How can we know before they get here?
Don't worry till you've seen 'em.

318
00:38:26,243 --> 00:38:28,203
<i>That one there. </i>

319
00:38:46,513 --> 00:38:48,891
Excuse me, samurai, sir.

320
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,936
Just like last time?

321
00:38:56,273 --> 00:38:59,360
Sure.
It's good practice for you.

322
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:33,435
Surely you jest.

323
00:39:34,436 --> 00:39:36,063
No offense intended.

324
00:39:51,286 --> 00:39:52,830
I'm with you.

325
00:39:55,374 --> 00:39:57,501
But I have to say

326
00:39:58,043 --> 00:40:00,754
that although I understand
the farmers' suffering

327
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:05,634
and understand
why you would take up their cause,

328
00:40:05,843 --> 00:40:10,723
it's your character
that I find most compelling.

329
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:16,270
In life one finds friends
in the strangest places.

330
00:40:22,276 --> 00:40:24,862
- What is your name?
- Gorobei Katayama.

331
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,031
A name fit for a giant, no?

332
00:40:38,042 --> 00:40:41,503
Yohei, what are you doing?
Hurry and wash the rice.

333
00:40:45,924 --> 00:40:47,468
Yohei!

334
00:40:51,347 --> 00:40:52,556
What's wrong?

335
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:57,311
Someone stole the rice.

336
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:11,659
You idiot!
Didn't I warn you?

337
00:41:11,867 --> 00:41:14,620
I was so careful.

338
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:23,837
I slept the whole night
hugging that rice jar.

339
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:30,928
Fine, then!
I'll get more from home!

340
00:41:32,262 --> 00:41:33,722
But what'll we do

341
00:41:33,931 --> 00:41:36,141
till you get back?

342
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:40,604
There's only a handful left.

343
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,950
Stop that, you idiot!

344
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:37,911
Hide that money.
The master's returning.

345
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:46,128
I ran into you
at just the right time.

346
00:42:49,006 --> 00:42:55,054
So you're still alive.
I figured you'd long since left this earth.

347
00:43:01,643 --> 00:43:04,396
Now tell me,
what happened after that?

348
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:08,108
I hid among the grasses
in the moat until dark.

349
00:43:10,611 --> 00:43:16,450
When the outer walls tumbled down
on me in flames, I knew I was finished.

350
00:43:17,493 --> 00:43:19,912
What ran through your mind
at that moment?

351
00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:23,791
Nothing special.

352
00:43:26,168 --> 00:43:28,921
Sick of fighting yet?

353
00:43:37,763 --> 00:43:43,977
Truth is, there's a tough battle ahead
leading to neither money nor rank.

354
00:43:44,186 --> 00:43:46,563
Will you join us?
- Yes.

355
00:43:47,398 --> 00:43:49,608
This may be the one
that kills us.

356
00:44:10,671 --> 00:44:12,506
Where are they
when you need 'em?

357
00:44:12,715 --> 00:44:14,800
What do you need, sir?

358
00:44:15,009 --> 00:44:17,177
Samurai.

359
00:44:19,221 --> 00:44:23,392
There's a pretty poor excuse for one
in my backyard.

360
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,187
I couldn't believe his gumption.

361
00:44:27,396 --> 00:44:30,149
He says,
"I'm hungry. Feed me.

362
00:44:30,357 --> 00:44:34,403
I'm broke, though,
so I'll pay you by chopping wood. "

363
00:44:39,825 --> 00:44:43,162
I like his frankness.

364
00:45:22,868 --> 00:45:25,788
Never seen a man
split wood before?

365
00:45:25,996 --> 00:45:28,457
Sure, but you do it
with such relish.

366
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:32,586
It's just my nature.
Sorry if it bothers you.

367
00:45:37,383 --> 00:45:38,676
You're very good.

368
00:45:38,884 --> 00:45:42,221
It's nothing compared
to how I cut down men.

369
00:45:42,429 --> 00:45:45,891
- Have you cut down many?
- That I have.

370
00:45:46,141 --> 00:45:48,811
There's no cutting me off
when I start cutting.

371
00:45:52,147 --> 00:45:55,484
So I make it a point
to run away first.

372
00:45:56,443 --> 00:45:59,071
A most excellent approach.

373
00:45:59,279 --> 00:46:01,448
Why, thank you kindly.

374
00:46:08,664 --> 00:46:13,502
Tell me, do you feel like
cutting down 30 bandits?

375
00:46:32,521 --> 00:46:34,106
Let us commence!

376
00:48:05,114 --> 00:48:06,323
Too bad.

377
00:48:06,532 --> 00:48:07,783
It's a draw.

378
00:48:07,992 --> 00:48:09,493
I'm afraid not.

379
00:48:09,702 --> 00:48:10,953
I won.

380
00:48:14,623 --> 00:48:15,708
That's ridiculous!

381
00:48:17,584 --> 00:48:20,212
If these were steel,
you'd be dead now.

382
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,469
- Then we fight with steel!
- Don't throw your life away.

383
00:48:27,678 --> 00:48:28,387
What?

384
00:48:28,595 --> 00:48:31,890
Don't you see?
With steel blades, you'd die.

385
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:33,517
It's a waste of your life.

386
00:48:33,726 --> 00:48:36,145
Wait! Don't try to flee.

387
00:48:39,773 --> 00:48:42,735
Draw! This isn't
a contest of words!

388
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:22,858
This is preposterous.

389
00:49:24,109 --> 00:49:26,153
There's no contest.

390
00:49:57,976 --> 00:49:59,687
How did you fare?

391
00:50:03,565 --> 00:50:06,694
We let a good fish get away.
An excellent swordsman.

392
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:10,239
They say the fish that gets away
looks bigger than it really is.

393
00:50:10,447 --> 00:50:11,657
No.

394
00:50:12,741 --> 00:50:16,245
I watched him cut a man down
with my own eyes.

395
00:50:23,252 --> 00:50:24,920
It was amazing.

396
00:50:25,254 --> 00:50:29,341
A man obsessed only
with testing the limits of his skill.

397
00:50:29,925 --> 00:50:31,969
I doubt he'll join us.

398
00:50:32,177 --> 00:50:34,555
- That's a shame.
- Indeed.

399
00:50:35,973 --> 00:50:38,726
I did tell him
where we're staying, though.

400
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:40,978
And how did you fare?

401
00:50:41,562 --> 00:50:43,355
- Caught one.
- I see.

402
00:50:43,564 --> 00:50:46,984
- As a swordsman, barely mediocre.
- Barely mediocre?

403
00:50:48,485 --> 00:50:51,405
But an honest, amusing man.

404
00:50:51,613 --> 00:50:54,366
Something about him
brightens one's spirits.

405
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:57,244
He'll be a treasure in hard times.

406
00:50:57,661 --> 00:50:58,996
Much obliged.

407
00:51:01,123 --> 00:51:05,961
Actually, I did land one myself.
- The one dressed as a peddler?

408
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:07,254
That's right.

409
00:51:07,463 --> 00:51:10,090
In fact, he's an old trusted friend.

410
00:51:16,055 --> 00:51:17,931
I'll bring some water.

411
00:51:21,643 --> 00:51:23,729
I'm Heihachi Hayashida.

412
00:51:23,937 --> 00:51:26,899
A modest warrior
of the Wood-Chop School.

413
00:51:32,821 --> 00:51:35,741
Just three more to go.

414
00:51:35,949 --> 00:51:38,285
Three? Don't you mean two?

415
00:51:38,494 --> 00:51:40,913
No, we can't afford
to take a child along.

416
00:51:42,456 --> 00:51:43,374
Master!

417
00:51:43,791 --> 00:51:45,542
I know, I know.

418
00:51:46,001 --> 00:51:48,337
I know what you'll say.

419
00:51:48,545 --> 00:51:52,716
I was once your age, you know.

420
00:51:53,884 --> 00:51:55,844
Hone your skills,

421
00:51:56,095 --> 00:51:59,306
then go to war
and do great things.

422
00:51:59,723 --> 00:52:03,560
Then become lord
of your own castle and domain.

423
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:09,817
But as you dream those dreams,
before you know it,

424
00:52:10,025 --> 00:52:12,152
your hair will turn
as gray as mine.

425
00:52:13,862 --> 00:52:17,866
By that time

426
00:52:18,075 --> 00:52:21,537
you've lost your parents
and you're all alone.

427
00:53:09,626 --> 00:53:11,712
Tomorrow you go home.

428
00:53:12,129 --> 00:53:14,631
You've learned a lot
these four or five days.

429
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,759
You have
fine stories to tell.

430
00:53:32,608 --> 00:53:36,362
Please, sir.
I beg you to let him come along.

431
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:39,531
Why not let him come?
You call him a kid, but --

432
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,075
Actually,

433
00:53:41,283 --> 00:53:43,494
kids work harder than adults.

434
00:53:44,453 --> 00:53:48,082
But only if you treat them
like adults.

435
00:53:48,749 --> 00:53:52,127
Then let's treat him
like an adult.

436
00:53:57,841 --> 00:54:00,302
That means only two more.

437
00:54:00,511 --> 00:54:03,681
Actually just one, it seems.

438
00:54:10,145 --> 00:54:12,272
You wish to join us?

439
00:54:13,482 --> 00:54:15,442
I'm very grateful.

440
00:54:15,651 --> 00:54:17,653
- When do we depart?
- Tomorrow.

441
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:22,491
Tomorrow?

442
00:54:24,326 --> 00:54:28,205
This is enough. We don't have time
to find the last one.

443
00:54:30,958 --> 00:54:32,626
All right, then.

444
00:54:36,046 --> 00:54:37,589
Master!

445
00:54:38,507 --> 00:54:40,217
Master!
- All right.

446
00:54:41,301 --> 00:54:44,471
- Master!
- All right! That's enough of that!

447
00:54:49,309 --> 00:54:52,146
Hey, I just found
a real tough samurai.

448
00:54:52,354 --> 00:54:54,690
There was a huge fight.
They were no match for him.

449
00:54:54,898 --> 00:54:57,484
Never seen anything like it.
He's like a wild dog.

450
00:54:57,693 --> 00:55:00,654
Someone stopped the fight.
They started drinking.

451
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,489
I told him about you.

452
00:55:02,698 --> 00:55:04,450
He's on his way.

453
00:55:06,869 --> 00:55:08,829
Shall we give him the usual?

454
00:55:22,843 --> 00:55:24,553
What are you doing?

455
00:55:25,012 --> 00:55:26,680
Testing him.

456
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,683
That's a dirty trick!

457
00:55:29,892 --> 00:55:32,353
Hey, samurai!
- Just shut up and watch.

458
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:34,563
A true samurai won't get hit.

459
00:55:34,772 --> 00:55:36,440
But this guy's drunk!

460
00:55:36,649 --> 00:55:39,485
A samurai never drinks
enough to dull his wits.

461
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:56,919
I told you!
You guys are nuts.

462
00:55:58,128 --> 00:55:59,838
What the --

463
00:56:03,759 --> 00:56:06,553
Who the hell hit me?

464
00:56:22,277 --> 00:56:23,904
You?

465
00:56:28,951 --> 00:56:32,246
Who hit me?

466
00:56:38,085 --> 00:56:39,545
You?

467
00:56:42,089 --> 00:56:44,258
Damn bastard!

468
00:57:12,786 --> 00:57:14,663
You again!

469
00:57:17,291 --> 00:57:20,711
I see that bald head of yours
in my dreams!

470
00:57:23,297 --> 00:57:25,215
Hey, you.

471
00:57:26,133 --> 00:57:28,969
How dare you even ask me
if I'm a samurai!

472
00:57:29,553 --> 00:57:31,555
You got some nerve!

473
00:57:33,474 --> 00:57:35,267
Don't mess with me.

474
00:57:42,149 --> 00:57:45,569
I may look like hell,
but I'm a real samurai!

475
00:57:49,114 --> 00:57:53,535
I've been looking for you
ever since that day.

476
00:57:54,745 --> 00:57:56,830
Wanted you to see this.

477
00:58:05,297 --> 00:58:06,840
Look at this!

478
00:58:07,049 --> 00:58:12,054
This is my family tree.
All my ancestors are here.

479
00:58:13,972 --> 00:58:18,227
Damn you, trying to make
a fool outta me. Screw you.

480
00:58:20,145 --> 00:58:21,438
Looky here.

481
00:58:23,065 --> 00:58:24,858
Making a fool outta me.

482
00:58:31,532 --> 00:58:33,784
My honorable self
is right here.

483
00:58:34,743 --> 00:58:37,204
So this Kikuchiyo here
would be you?

484
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:39,206
That is correct.

485
00:58:39,581 --> 00:58:43,752
" Kikuchiyo,
born February 17, 1574. "

486
00:58:45,796 --> 00:58:47,923
What's so damned funny?

487
00:58:49,466 --> 00:58:52,177
You hardly look
13 years old to me.

488
00:58:53,095 --> 00:58:57,057
If you are in fact
the Kikuchiyo listed here,

489
00:58:57,266 --> 00:59:00,102
you'd now be precisely
13 years old.

490
00:59:04,606 --> 00:59:07,359
Where'd you steal
this family tree?

491
00:59:07,943 --> 00:59:11,322
Steal it? Shit!

492
00:59:11,947 --> 00:59:13,949
Damn jerks.

493
00:59:14,116 --> 00:59:16,160
To hell with samurai.

494
00:59:17,661 --> 00:59:19,788
To hell with samurai!

495
00:59:22,666 --> 00:59:25,044
Hey, you bastard!

496
00:59:26,503 --> 00:59:29,173
Come back here!

497
00:59:29,381 --> 00:59:32,593
Goddamn it,
you son of a bitch!

498
00:59:42,811 --> 00:59:46,106
What's wrong, teenager?
Here you are.

499
00:59:48,359 --> 00:59:50,486
Damn you!

500
00:59:52,154 --> 00:59:54,073
Come back here!

501
01:00:29,108 --> 01:00:31,068
What's wrong, Lord Kikuchiyo?

502
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:37,950
What's the matter, junior?

503
01:00:47,584 --> 01:00:50,170
Screw samurai!

504
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:10,399
- Is he really a samurai?
- In his own mind, anyway.

505
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:23,454
<i>Take me too!</i>

506
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:30,794
Hey, Kikuchiyo.

507
01:01:33,464 --> 01:01:35,341
Guard your treasure.

508
01:01:37,217 --> 01:01:40,179
Let me go too!

509
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:22,930
What is it, Father?

510
01:02:39,488 --> 01:02:41,281
What is it?

511
01:02:42,157 --> 01:02:44,326
What are you staring at?

512
01:02:52,501 --> 01:02:56,088
Shino, cut off your hair.

513
01:02:56,296 --> 01:02:58,882
Cut your hair
and dress like a man.

514
01:03:01,051 --> 01:03:03,554
- What are you talking about?
- Just cut it off!

515
01:03:04,555 --> 01:03:08,475
It's only because I love you.
No telling what those samurai'll do!

516
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:09,601
No!

517
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:12,187
No, I won't!

518
01:03:16,525 --> 01:03:18,027
Shino!

519
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:44,219
He's a fool.

520
01:03:44,428 --> 01:03:47,890
But Manzo knows those samurai
better than anyone.

521
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:50,184
If he cut off his daughter's hair,
he must have good reason.

522
01:03:50,392 --> 01:03:53,520
You've only got sons,
so you're safe, but we --

523
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:56,231
Goddamn it!
Now I understand.

524
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:00,319
So you agree to hide my daughter
at your place across the bridge?

525
01:04:00,527 --> 01:04:03,447
Idiot! I meant that I see
what Manzo's up to.

526
01:04:04,198 --> 01:04:09,870
That rascal doesn't care about the village,
only about his daughter.

527
01:04:10,245 --> 01:04:11,622
Damn him!

528
01:04:30,724 --> 01:04:32,893
Look what you've done!

529
01:04:33,394 --> 01:04:35,437
Now the whole village is crazed.

530
01:04:35,646 --> 01:04:37,898
Every family
with a girl's gone mad.

531
01:04:39,692 --> 01:04:41,735
How do you plan
to set this right?

532
01:04:41,986 --> 01:04:44,738
The samurai will show up
any day now.

533
01:04:45,614 --> 01:04:48,575
Come on.
We're seeing the Old Man.

534
01:04:50,619 --> 01:04:53,664
There's nothing to see here!
Go home!

535
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:56,333
Go home!

536
01:04:58,127 --> 01:05:01,672
We can't let the samurai
see us like this.

537
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:10,431
He's still following us.

538
01:06:55,744 --> 01:06:57,788
Where did Kikuchiyo go?

539
01:06:58,747 --> 01:07:00,457
Think he gave up?

540
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:02,459
It's funny.

541
01:07:02,751 --> 01:07:04,878
Now that he's gone,
it's almost a little...

542
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:07,047
Ionely.

543
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:14,555
This way.

544
01:07:16,974 --> 01:07:18,851
Oh, hell!

545
01:07:31,822 --> 01:07:34,366
So that's our castle, eh?

546
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:38,203
No way I'm gonna die
in that dungheap.

547
01:07:38,412 --> 01:07:40,914
No one asked you to.

548
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:03,228
We're back!
The samurai have arrived!

549
01:08:08,275 --> 01:08:10,235
The samurai are here!

550
01:08:14,948 --> 01:08:18,619
What's wrong with you?
The samurai are here!

551
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:26,752
Hey, what's wrong?

552
01:08:30,839 --> 01:08:32,633
What's the matter?

553
01:08:46,647 --> 01:08:48,983
This is a fine welcome.

554
01:08:52,611 --> 01:08:54,655
What's the meaning of this?

555
01:08:57,574 --> 01:09:01,495
Hey, what's going on?
The samurai have arrived!

556
01:09:17,636 --> 01:09:19,972
- We'll go see the Old Man.
- The Old Man?

557
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:23,142
Whatever happens in the village,
the Old Man --

558
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:25,352
He's the village elder?

559
01:09:26,895 --> 01:09:31,358
An audience with the village elder.
This is truly an honor.

560
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:36,864
Well, let's go.

561
01:10:48,894 --> 01:10:54,274
I know they're being foolish.

562
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:58,529
All farmers ever do is worry,

563
01:10:58,737 --> 01:11:03,575
whether the rain falls,
the sun shines, or the wind blows.

564
01:11:03,909 --> 01:11:05,953
In short,

565
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:10,124
all they know is fear.

566
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:14,169
Their behavior today...

567
01:11:15,796 --> 01:11:19,299
is also due simply to fear.

568
01:11:22,052 --> 01:11:27,099
But Old Man,
why do the villagers fear us?

569
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:31,812
What can they expect from us
under such circumstances?

570
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:04,261
Samurai, sirs!

571
01:12:04,928 --> 01:12:07,473
Samurai, please!

572
01:12:24,406 --> 01:12:27,618
Quiet down!

573
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:30,913
Don't panic. Calm down.

574
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:34,333
I want clear answers.

575
01:12:34,541 --> 01:12:36,835
Where are the bandits
coming from?

576
01:12:37,044 --> 01:12:40,297
- The mountains!
- No, the road!

577
01:12:43,592 --> 01:12:46,720
Who saw the bandits?
Come forward.

578
01:12:47,012 --> 01:12:49,223
No one saw any bandits?

579
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:51,934
Then who sounded the alarm?

580
01:12:52,142 --> 01:12:53,394
<i>I did!</i>

581
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:02,236
Outta the way.

582
01:13:06,865 --> 01:13:09,368
What's with the faces?

583
01:13:10,661 --> 01:13:13,706
Don't worry.
No bandits have come.

584
01:13:19,044 --> 01:13:20,754
Hey, blockheads.

585
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:24,633
Remember how you welcomed us
when we got here?

586
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:27,636
But as soon as I bang on this,

587
01:13:27,845 --> 01:13:31,223
" Samurai, sirs!
Samurai, please!"

588
01:13:31,682 --> 01:13:33,934
You're practically groveling!

589
01:13:38,814 --> 01:13:41,442
Got what you deserved,
you mud snails.

590
01:13:59,209 --> 01:14:01,754
Got a problem, gramps?

591
01:14:01,962 --> 01:14:03,255
Nope.

592
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:05,758
All's well now.

593
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:14,099
Looks like he's good
for something after all.

594
01:14:14,308 --> 01:14:16,894
There are seven of us at last.

595
01:14:24,109 --> 01:14:26,070
Sorry it's so dirty.

596
01:14:26,278 --> 01:14:30,115
But where will you sleep
if we take your home?

597
01:14:30,407 --> 01:14:33,827
- In the barn.
- With your horse?

598
01:14:35,371 --> 01:14:38,290
The bandits
got my horse last year.

599
01:14:55,641 --> 01:14:59,228
A barn's not so bad
with a wife to snuggle up to.

600
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,693
I don't have a wife!

601
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:07,611
What's the matter, you fool?

602
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:20,708
Jerk.

603
01:15:34,263 --> 01:15:36,932
By the way,
what's your real name?

604
01:15:38,851 --> 01:15:40,686
I don't remember.

605
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:43,439
Give me a new one that fits.

606
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:46,108
Then Kikuchiyo it is.

607
01:15:47,318 --> 01:15:49,445
Fits you perfectly.

608
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:14,328
How would you attack
this village?

609
01:16:14,536 --> 01:16:17,122
I'd charge from this mountain.

610
01:16:18,749 --> 01:16:20,834
I agree.
Along this road.

611
01:16:21,418 --> 01:16:23,587
WEST

612
01:16:38,644 --> 01:16:41,438
And what's the best defense?

613
01:16:41,772 --> 01:16:43,816
Shichiroji knows what to do.

614
01:16:44,567 --> 01:16:47,945
See these logs?
He'll make a fence to block the horses.

615
01:16:48,153 --> 01:16:50,614
Indeed.
Your trusty right-hand man.

616
01:17:19,602 --> 01:17:20,895
All right!

617
01:17:21,562 --> 01:17:23,105
Listen.

618
01:17:24,231 --> 01:17:26,233
Nothing forces you to run
like a battle.

619
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:29,612
You run when you attack,
you run when you retreat.

620
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:32,156
When you can't run anymore,
you die.

621
01:17:50,674 --> 01:17:53,177
SOUTH

622
01:18:06,523 --> 01:18:10,194
We'll flood these fields
after they harvest the barley.

623
01:18:10,486 --> 01:18:15,074
That'll make a good defense.
But will we have time?

624
01:18:15,282 --> 01:18:16,575
Indeed.

625
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:25,626
Charge!

626
01:18:26,627 --> 01:18:30,756
Pretend I'm a bandit
and stab me.

627
01:18:33,759 --> 01:18:35,386
Charge!

628
01:18:38,597 --> 01:18:40,266
Come on!

629
01:18:49,275 --> 01:18:50,693
<i>Next. </i>

630
01:18:52,444 --> 01:18:53,946
<i>Next. </i>

631
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:56,323
What's wrong with all of you?

632
01:19:20,431 --> 01:19:23,559
EAST

633
01:19:27,104 --> 01:19:31,650
Destroying this bridge
will foil an assault from the east.

634
01:19:38,741 --> 01:19:41,869
But what about the houses
on the other side?

635
01:19:49,210 --> 01:19:51,795
They'll have to evacuate those.

636
01:19:56,175 --> 01:19:58,260
And the mill?

637
01:20:00,221 --> 01:20:03,390
The Old Man's
not going to go quietly.

638
01:20:09,605 --> 01:20:12,441
Listen now.
The enemy is scary.

639
01:20:13,067 --> 01:20:14,526
Everybody's scared.

640
01:20:14,777 --> 01:20:18,197
But the other side's
scared of us too.

641
01:20:47,601 --> 01:20:49,270
Just great.

642
01:20:50,271 --> 01:20:52,940
You all make great scarecrows.

643
01:20:55,359 --> 01:20:59,238
Problem is, the enemy
isn't a bunch of sparrows and crows!

644
01:21:07,705 --> 01:21:11,375
You there, chewing your cud.
Can you cut that out?

645
01:21:15,504 --> 01:21:17,548
This isn't a cow shed!

646
01:21:20,885 --> 01:21:23,262
Look at the bunch of you.

647
01:21:26,223 --> 01:21:27,808
Shit!

648
01:21:28,017 --> 01:21:30,728
First in line, step forward!

649
01:21:33,105 --> 01:21:35,107
I'm talking to you!

650
01:21:35,691 --> 01:21:36,901
You!

651
01:21:57,171 --> 01:22:00,424
<i>Look here! You gotta pay
a mon each to watch the show!</i>

652
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:21,070
What's this?

653
01:22:22,071 --> 01:22:25,032
- A spear, sir.
- Idiot.

654
01:22:25,241 --> 01:22:27,952
Where the hell
did you get it?

655
01:22:28,869 --> 01:22:31,372
Did it sprout up in those hills?

656
01:22:33,749 --> 01:22:35,209
I know perfectly well.

657
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:37,878
You hunted down retreating warriors
and took their weapons.

658
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:41,882
If you've got one,
you must have more.

659
01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:46,387
Fess up, damn it!

660
01:22:55,187 --> 01:22:57,648
NORTH

661
01:23:07,074 --> 01:23:11,287
What a peaceful grove.
But it's also a death trap.

662
01:23:47,156 --> 01:23:48,616
Katsushiro.

663
01:23:49,033 --> 01:23:51,243
We're going.
- I'll be right there.

664
01:23:59,251 --> 01:24:01,128
As I said,
he's still a child.

665
01:25:02,731 --> 01:25:05,526
Are you from the village?

666
01:25:10,072 --> 01:25:11,448
Are you a girl?

667
01:25:15,202 --> 01:25:17,413
A boy?

668
01:25:18,247 --> 01:25:21,208
Then where's your spear?

669
01:25:21,417 --> 01:25:24,837
Is this any time for an able-bodied man
to be picking flowers?

670
01:25:25,713 --> 01:25:28,007
Come here!
I'll teach you.

671
01:25:28,465 --> 01:25:30,009
Come here!

672
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:36,056
Why, you!

673
01:26:40,871 --> 01:26:43,791
This is fine, and this too.

674
01:26:43,958 --> 01:26:45,876
But this is a problem.

675
01:26:46,418 --> 01:26:48,921
<i>Heave ho! Heave ho!</i>

676
01:26:51,799 --> 01:26:54,218
Get back, the rest of you!

677
01:26:54,843 --> 01:26:57,346
Stand up straight!

678
01:27:02,685 --> 01:27:04,478
What a haul!

679
01:27:10,985 --> 01:27:12,278
What's all this?

680
01:27:12,486 --> 01:27:14,822
Plunder from defeated warriors.

681
01:27:16,490 --> 01:27:18,325
Where did you find it?

682
01:27:18,534 --> 01:27:21,537
Here in the village?
- Yep, over at Manzo's.

683
01:27:31,130 --> 01:27:32,840
What's the matter?

684
01:27:34,925 --> 01:27:36,677
Don't you like 'em?

685
01:27:38,846 --> 01:27:41,348
This is good stuff.

686
01:27:42,975 --> 01:27:44,518
What's wrong?

687
01:27:44,727 --> 01:27:48,147
You said you wanted armor,
spears and bows. Now you got 'em.

688
01:27:48,355 --> 01:27:50,774
Bastard!
You call yourself a samurai?

689
01:27:52,067 --> 01:27:55,029
Those farmers killed samurai
to get these.

690
01:27:55,237 --> 01:27:57,197
- I know that.
- Then why the hell --

691
01:27:57,406 --> 01:27:59,241
That's enough!

692
01:28:00,576 --> 01:28:04,205
You can't understand
unless you've been hunted.

693
01:28:17,051 --> 01:28:19,762
It's nothing.
Get outta here.

694
01:28:43,077 --> 01:28:47,957
Now I want to kill them all.

695
01:29:01,845 --> 01:29:03,764
Well, that's just fine and dandy!

696
01:29:06,267 --> 01:29:10,729
What did ya think
these farmers were anyway?

697
01:29:10,938 --> 01:29:13,440
Buddhas or something?

698
01:29:13,983 --> 01:29:15,568
Don't make me laugh!

699
01:29:15,818 --> 01:29:18,237
There's no creature on earth
as wily as a farmer!

700
01:29:24,118 --> 01:29:26,954
Ask 'em for rice, barley,
anything,

701
01:29:27,121 --> 01:29:29,498
and all they ever say is,
"We're all out. "

702
01:29:30,916 --> 01:29:35,212
But they've got it.
They've got everything.

703
01:29:36,130 --> 01:29:40,134
Dig under the floorboards.
If it's not there, try the barn.

704
01:29:40,342 --> 01:29:45,806
You'll find plenty.
Jars of rice, salt, beans, sake!

705
01:29:50,853 --> 01:29:54,023
Go up in the mountains.
They have hidden fields.

706
01:29:54,607 --> 01:29:57,234
They kowtow and lie,
playing innocent the whole time.

707
01:29:57,443 --> 01:29:59,820
You name it,
they'll cheat you on it!

708
01:30:00,029 --> 01:30:03,073
After a battle, they hunt down
the losers with their spears.

709
01:30:05,492 --> 01:30:06,619
Listen to me!

710
01:30:06,827 --> 01:30:10,331
Farmers are misers, weasels,

711
01:30:10,539 --> 01:30:11,790
and crybabies!

712
01:30:11,999 --> 01:30:14,335
They're mean, stupid

713
01:30:14,543 --> 01:30:16,337
murderers!

714
01:30:16,545 --> 01:30:19,632
Damn!
I could laugh till I cry!

715
01:30:23,344 --> 01:30:27,139
But tell me this:
Who turned them into such monsters?

716
01:30:27,389 --> 01:30:30,809
You did!
You samurai did!

717
01:30:31,227 --> 01:30:33,020
Damn you to hell!

718
01:30:39,944 --> 01:30:41,737
In war, you burn their villages,

719
01:30:41,946 --> 01:30:45,032
trample their fields,
steal their food,

720
01:30:45,866 --> 01:30:48,869
work them like slaves,
rape their women,

721
01:30:49,078 --> 01:30:50,704
and kill 'em if they resist.

722
01:30:50,913 --> 01:30:52,790
What do you expect 'em to do?

723
01:30:52,998 --> 01:30:55,292
What the hell are farmers
supposed to do?

724
01:30:55,501 --> 01:30:57,962
Damn it! Goddamn it!

725
01:31:35,749 --> 01:31:39,378
You were born a farmer,
weren't you?

726
01:32:16,957 --> 01:32:20,252
What is it now?

727
01:32:20,461 --> 01:32:24,381
Nothing at all.
Everything's fine.

728
01:33:30,072 --> 01:33:31,615
It's me.

729
01:33:31,866 --> 01:33:33,909
I'm sleeping here
from now on.

730
01:33:34,577 --> 01:33:36,871
Those guys cramp my style.

731
01:33:38,706 --> 01:33:41,750
Idiot! Stop cowering!

732
01:33:42,418 --> 01:33:44,461
This is your place!

733
01:33:45,004 --> 01:33:47,798
You hand over your house
and sleep in a barn,

734
01:33:48,007 --> 01:33:49,800
and still you can't stand up
for yourself.

735
01:33:50,009 --> 01:33:51,510
Get to sleep!

736
01:34:08,152 --> 01:34:10,070
Brings back memories.

737
01:34:28,464 --> 01:34:30,424
Sure is quiet.

738
01:34:33,344 --> 01:34:38,641
On a day like this, it's hard
to imagine bandits on that mountain.

739
01:34:40,601 --> 01:34:43,687
Damn it all,
I need a girl!

740
01:34:52,530 --> 01:34:53,989
- Where are you going?
- The hills.

741
01:34:54,198 --> 01:34:56,242
- The hills?
- To practice.

742
01:34:57,952 --> 01:34:59,537
No girls up there.

743
01:35:01,247 --> 01:35:03,958
Sometimes you really
hit the nail on the head.

744
01:35:05,125 --> 01:35:07,419
What are you making there?

745
01:35:07,628 --> 01:35:09,547
- A flag.
- A flag?

746
01:35:10,297 --> 01:35:15,928
It doesn't feel right in battle
without a banner to raise high.

747
01:35:20,766 --> 01:35:22,476
What do the symbols mean?

748
01:35:22,643 --> 01:35:27,481
This represents a field:
That is, the farmers and this village.

749
01:35:28,399 --> 01:35:30,776
- And those circles?
- Those are us.

750
01:35:31,735 --> 01:35:34,321
There's only six.
You leaving me out?

751
01:35:34,530 --> 01:35:37,616
No, this triangle's Lord Kikuchiyo.

752
01:35:37,825 --> 01:35:39,702
That's a good one!

753
01:37:00,908 --> 01:37:02,618
It's real rice.

754
01:37:02,910 --> 01:37:04,828
Go ahead. Eat.
- But --

755
01:37:05,037 --> 01:37:07,206
Rikichi gave me some millet.

756
01:37:07,414 --> 01:37:11,710
I could barely get it down.

757
01:37:13,754 --> 01:37:15,506
Go ahead. Eat.

758
01:37:26,850 --> 01:37:28,269
Hurry up and eat.

759
01:37:28,435 --> 01:37:30,312
If you're embarrassed, I'll go.

760
01:37:30,521 --> 01:37:32,356
I'm not going to eat it.

761
01:37:32,606 --> 01:37:34,775
Why not?
I went to a lot of trouble.

762
01:37:34,984 --> 01:37:36,902
No, I just --

763
01:37:38,153 --> 01:37:43,450
I know you did, so I'll take it
to Kyuemon's grandma.

764
01:37:43,659 --> 01:37:46,412
Kyuemon's grandma?

765
01:38:07,099 --> 01:38:11,353
Rikichi, I'm full.
I'll save the rest for later.

766
01:38:12,104 --> 01:38:14,481
Go ahead and eat.

767
01:38:14,732 --> 01:38:16,692
Take my leftovers this time.

768
01:38:17,693 --> 01:38:21,280
What's this?
What are you up to?

769
01:38:21,488 --> 01:38:22,990
What's going on?

770
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,833
How terrible.

771
01:38:34,335 --> 01:38:38,422
Doesn't she have family?
- The bandits got them all.

772
01:38:44,887 --> 01:38:46,347
I...

773
01:38:47,223 --> 01:38:52,019
want to die quickly.

774
01:38:52,186 --> 01:38:56,440
I want to die soon

775
01:38:56,649 --> 01:39:00,861
and leave this suffering behind.

776
01:39:02,488 --> 01:39:04,865
But you know...

777
01:39:05,950 --> 01:39:09,828
the other world may be

778
01:39:10,037 --> 01:39:14,166
just as full of suffering
as this one.

779
01:39:16,001 --> 01:39:17,753
It's not.

780
01:39:17,962 --> 01:39:22,299
In that world
there's no war and no bandits.

781
01:39:22,675 --> 01:39:24,843
There's no suffering there,
grandma.

782
01:39:25,052 --> 01:39:28,639
How the hell would you know?
Have you been there?

783
01:39:28,847 --> 01:39:30,558
Why the hell
are you always screaming?

784
01:39:30,766 --> 01:39:32,476
I hate wimps.

785
01:39:32,685 --> 01:39:35,312
Worms like her make me sick!

786
01:39:37,898 --> 01:39:39,984
Pissing and grumbling
about everything.

787
01:39:41,443 --> 01:39:44,446
Shit!
I want to do something wild!

788
01:39:44,697 --> 01:39:48,576
Save your spit and fire
for the bandits.

789
01:40:04,341 --> 01:40:06,135
Excuse me.

790
01:40:08,095 --> 01:40:11,223
Excuse me, but why did you --

791
01:40:11,515 --> 01:40:14,226
You saw us today, didn't you?

792
01:40:14,435 --> 01:40:16,896
Me and the --

793
01:40:17,104 --> 01:40:19,064
- The girl?
- Yes.

794
01:40:20,065 --> 01:40:23,819
Why didn't you --
- Tell them? You want me to?

795
01:40:39,001 --> 01:40:43,464
We want rice!
White rice!

796
01:40:48,219 --> 01:40:51,805
You little brats!
There's no rice!

797
01:40:57,561 --> 01:40:59,563
Quit yapping!

798
01:40:59,772 --> 01:41:04,735
If you've got the strength
to scream, "We want rice!"

799
01:41:04,944 --> 01:41:07,321
Then you don't need it!

800
01:41:07,738 --> 01:41:10,574
Listen here,
you little piss pants.

801
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:14,828
This is all the rice there is.

802
01:41:15,037 --> 01:41:18,249
If we give you any more,
we'll get all --

803
01:41:21,961 --> 01:41:23,420
That's how it is.

804
01:41:23,629 --> 01:41:27,383
Say, any of you got
a pretty sister?

805
01:41:29,843 --> 01:41:33,556
How about you?
You got one?

806
01:41:33,806 --> 01:41:37,351
So, Old Man,
when is the harvest?

807
01:41:39,728 --> 01:41:41,522
In ten days.

808
01:41:41,730 --> 01:41:44,024
How quickly can you do it?

809
01:41:46,026 --> 01:41:48,904
No less than three days.

810
01:41:49,947 --> 01:41:51,991
We'll flood the fields
when you're done.

811
01:41:52,199 --> 01:41:56,036
You see, we want to create
a moat to the south of the village.

812
01:41:56,203 --> 01:41:58,330
It'll keep the horses out.

813
01:41:58,539 --> 01:42:01,876
We don't need all the fields.
One patch per family will do.

814
01:42:02,084 --> 01:42:03,586
Then...

815
01:42:04,128 --> 01:42:08,424
it'll take at least a day to flatten
the paths and draw the water.

816
01:42:08,632 --> 01:42:10,968
Understood.

817
01:42:11,302 --> 01:42:13,554
There's one other thing.

818
01:42:14,054 --> 01:42:20,352
You need to leave the houses this side
of the bridge, and the mill too.

819
01:42:21,437 --> 01:42:23,230
Father!

820
01:42:23,522 --> 01:42:25,649
You want us to move out?

821
01:42:32,990 --> 01:42:35,242
I know it's tough.

822
01:42:36,911 --> 01:42:39,038
But there's no choice.

823
01:42:40,664 --> 01:42:44,585
We can't possibly protect
the outlying houses.

824
01:43:05,773 --> 01:43:09,068
Listen carefully. You'll soon
begin harvesting the barley.

825
01:43:09,318 --> 01:43:11,278
The bandits will come
when you're done.

826
01:43:11,445 --> 01:43:13,322
We have to assume that.

827
01:43:13,531 --> 01:43:17,284
Therefore we prepare
for battle as we harvest.

828
01:43:17,660 --> 01:43:21,205
We'll harvest not as families
but as squads.

829
01:43:21,705 --> 01:43:26,001
Starting tomorrow,
each squad will live and work as one.

830
01:43:26,210 --> 01:43:31,090
Understood? Starting tomorrow,
nobody acts on his own.

831
01:43:32,383 --> 01:43:34,260
Hey, everybody.

832
01:43:35,886 --> 01:43:39,807
Give your wives
plenty of lovin' tonight, you hear?

833
01:44:00,995 --> 01:44:03,539
This is all a load of crap!

834
01:44:03,747 --> 01:44:06,500
Everyone from across the bridge,
follow me.

835
01:44:09,211 --> 01:44:11,297
Throw down your spears.

836
01:44:11,505 --> 01:44:15,509
Why should we abandon
our homes to protect theirs?

837
01:44:16,427 --> 01:44:19,972
That's right.
We'll protect our homes ourselves.

838
01:44:22,057 --> 01:44:23,642
Stop!

839
01:44:26,812 --> 01:44:28,647
Pick up your spears!

840
01:44:29,315 --> 01:44:30,774
Return to your line!

841
01:44:56,592 --> 01:44:58,844
Fall in!

842
01:44:59,762 --> 01:45:02,014
Squad formation!

843
01:45:05,059 --> 01:45:07,478
Where's Yohei gone?

844
01:45:08,896 --> 01:45:10,564
Where the hell's Yohei?

845
01:45:16,111 --> 01:45:19,198
There you are, you idiot!

846
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:39,009
There are three outlying houses,

847
01:45:39,885 --> 01:45:41,887
but 20 in the village.

848
01:45:42,763 --> 01:45:46,725
We can't risk 20
to save three.

849
01:45:47,977 --> 01:45:52,273
And if this village is destroyed,

850
01:45:53,148 --> 01:45:55,359
those three cannot survive
on their own.

851
01:45:59,446 --> 01:46:02,908
Is that clear?
This is the nature of war:

852
01:46:04,451 --> 01:46:07,246
By protecting others,
you save yourself.

853
01:46:09,248 --> 01:46:11,709
If you only think of yourself,

854
01:46:12,209 --> 01:46:14,378
you'll only destroy yourself.

855
01:46:17,464 --> 01:46:21,260
From this day forward,
anyone caught doing that...

856
01:52:53,308 --> 01:52:54,935
Hot damn!

857
01:52:55,144 --> 01:52:56,937
Look at all those girls!

858
01:52:57,229 --> 01:52:58,564
Hey, Yohei!

859
01:53:04,153 --> 01:53:06,905
Where the hell
have you been hiding these girls?

860
01:53:11,243 --> 01:53:12,995
You devil.

861
01:53:20,836 --> 01:53:23,088
Hey, lend me your scythe.

862
01:53:24,298 --> 01:53:26,300
I'll cut three times your share.

863
01:53:26,508 --> 01:53:29,511
In return,
we get nice and friendly, eh?

864
01:53:53,577 --> 01:53:54,995
- Rikichi.
- Yes.

865
01:53:56,205 --> 01:53:59,875
It seems the married couples
are the most productive.

866
01:54:00,584 --> 01:54:02,711
Time you got yourself a wife.

867
01:54:06,131 --> 01:54:10,260
Why do you always get so mad?
I just said you should --

868
01:54:11,512 --> 01:54:13,764
Katsushiro, go after him.

869
01:54:13,972 --> 01:54:16,058
Running off at a time like this.

870
01:54:17,267 --> 01:54:18,685
Rikichi!

871
01:54:19,728 --> 01:54:21,146
Rikichi!

872
01:54:25,359 --> 01:54:28,028
Shino, what are you gawking at?

873
01:54:44,169 --> 01:54:47,339
What's this? A bear's den?

874
01:54:49,383 --> 01:54:51,510
This was done with a scythe.

875
01:54:53,679 --> 01:54:54,972
Was it Rikichi?

876
01:54:55,597 --> 01:54:58,058
Yes, though I didn't actually
see him do it.

877
01:54:58,267 --> 01:55:00,435
I lost him for a while,

878
01:55:00,644 --> 01:55:02,521
but then I spotted him
leaving this grove.

879
01:55:02,729 --> 01:55:05,858
He was furious,
soaked in sweat.

880
01:55:09,444 --> 01:55:11,113
What did you say to him?

881
01:55:11,321 --> 01:55:14,783
Nothing. Just that he should
hurry up and find a wife.

882
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:22,291
Something's upsetting the little bugger,
but he won't say what.

883
01:55:22,791 --> 01:55:25,169
You can see it
all over his face.

884
01:55:26,003 --> 01:55:31,550
Those lips of his
are bolted up tight as a house.

885
01:55:31,758 --> 01:55:34,136
Why don't you try to open them up?

886
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:42,436
Who's there?

887
01:55:42,644 --> 01:55:43,896
<i>It's me. </i>

888
01:55:46,273 --> 01:55:48,775
All clear?
- Yes.

889
01:55:56,200 --> 01:56:00,162
Have a seat.
Let's have a little chat.

890
01:56:05,375 --> 01:56:08,879
I think talking...

891
01:56:09,588 --> 01:56:11,423
is a good thing.

892
01:56:12,007 --> 01:56:15,969
Whatever your burden may be,
talking can ease it.

893
01:56:19,223 --> 01:56:23,101
You, for example,
seem pretty tight-lipped,

894
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:28,232
but if you're suffering,
you shouldn't bottle it up.

895
01:56:31,026 --> 01:56:35,489
Letting out your feelings
bit by bit can work wonders.

896
01:56:36,782 --> 01:56:39,409
I've got nothing to say.

897
01:56:57,052 --> 01:56:58,887
Time to head out.

898
01:57:01,431 --> 01:57:02,474
Shall we wake him?

899
01:57:02,683 --> 01:57:04,852
No, let the kid sleep.

900
01:57:08,814 --> 01:57:10,232
Shino.

901
01:57:13,026 --> 01:57:15,070
I swear he just said " Shino. "

902
01:57:18,115 --> 01:57:19,950
Sounds like a woman's name.

903
01:57:20,159 --> 01:57:22,953
Even kids can be charmers
in their dreams.

904
01:57:29,376 --> 01:57:31,879
Where shall we start our rounds?

905
01:57:32,087 --> 01:57:35,257
The place that worries us most,
of course.

906
01:58:32,648 --> 01:58:34,107
Who's there?

907
01:58:40,948 --> 01:58:42,449
Who's there?

908
01:58:42,991 --> 01:58:44,660
Come out here!

909
01:58:45,410 --> 01:58:46,370
Who's there?

910
01:58:46,578 --> 01:58:47,996
Kikuchiyo.

911
01:58:50,332 --> 01:58:52,417
You're lucky it was us.

912
01:58:52,835 --> 01:58:55,963
If we'd been bandits,
you'd be headless right now.

913
01:59:27,995 --> 01:59:29,496
Yohei.

914
01:59:30,873 --> 01:59:32,583
What's this?

915
01:59:32,916 --> 01:59:35,002
That's my horse, sir.

916
01:59:37,337 --> 01:59:40,132
I thought it was a big old mouse.

917
02:00:19,797 --> 02:00:23,842
<i>The sparrows chirp, chirp, chirp</i>

918
02:00:24,802 --> 02:00:28,597
<i>The crows caw, caw, caw</i>

919
02:00:32,434 --> 02:00:35,687
I wonder why
the bandits aren't coming.

920
02:00:38,023 --> 02:00:43,445
What a waste if they don't.
Think how much we feed those samurai.

921
02:00:43,612 --> 02:00:47,407
Idiot!
It's best if they don't come!

922
02:00:53,956 --> 02:00:57,209
A nag like that
can't carry your weight!

923
02:00:57,417 --> 02:01:00,671
Yohei's horse is too worn out.

924
02:01:02,798 --> 02:01:05,884
Please stop. Yohei'll be in tears
if you break its leg.

925
02:01:06,093 --> 02:01:09,596
A skilled horseman
can make even a nag soar into the sky.

926
02:01:21,650 --> 02:01:22,860
Not bad.

927
02:01:38,625 --> 02:01:40,544
Very fine indeed!

928
02:02:04,568 --> 02:02:06,612
They seem to be having fun.

929
02:02:08,197 --> 02:02:11,033
The threshing's done,
and still no bandits.

930
02:02:11,492 --> 02:02:14,870
Everyone's saying
they might not come after all.

931
02:02:16,121 --> 02:02:18,373
A tempting thought.

932
02:02:18,874 --> 02:02:24,087
But when you think you're safe
is precisely when you're most vulnerable.

933
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:27,800
Send them back
to their posts.

934
02:03:01,250 --> 02:03:05,003
I wish I'd been born
into a samurai family.

935
02:03:08,132 --> 02:03:10,092
A farmer's life is too cruel.

936
02:03:11,218 --> 02:03:14,221
My life has been so easy,
I'm ashamed.

937
02:03:14,429 --> 02:03:16,765
That's not what I meant.

938
02:03:17,141 --> 02:03:21,603
It's because you're a samurai
and I'm a farmer.

939
02:03:21,812 --> 02:03:23,230
But I don't --

940
02:03:23,438 --> 02:03:26,650
It's all right. I don't mind.
We can't know

941
02:03:26,859 --> 02:03:29,027
what the future holds!

942
02:04:02,352 --> 02:04:05,564
Coward!
Act like a samurai!

943
02:05:12,631 --> 02:05:15,384
Three suspicious characters
on the western road.

944
02:05:17,845 --> 02:05:20,597
- The villagers haven't noticed?
- Not yet.

945
02:05:20,806 --> 02:05:22,850
We can't have them
sounding the alarm.

946
02:05:25,227 --> 02:05:28,147
I saw three horses
up in the hills.

947
02:05:28,355 --> 02:05:31,233
I think they're bandits.
- We know.

948
02:05:35,946 --> 02:05:38,157
- So they're here.
- How did you know?

949
02:05:38,365 --> 02:05:41,535
How could I not?
This one here was in such a panic.

950
02:05:44,955 --> 02:05:47,541
Where are they coming from?
The mountains or the west?

951
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:51,420
The west.

952
02:06:00,095 --> 02:06:00,971
Bandits!

953
02:06:05,517 --> 02:06:08,562
Send everyone to their houses.
There are only three of them.

954
02:06:08,770 --> 02:06:11,565
Tell them to keep quiet
no matter what.

955
02:06:11,773 --> 02:06:16,111
They're probably scouts.
We can't let them see any samurai.

956
02:06:33,337 --> 02:06:35,422
What is it?

957
02:06:35,881 --> 02:06:37,633
Bandits?

958
02:06:40,302 --> 02:06:43,347
Bandits, eh?
Where are they?

959
02:06:55,025 --> 02:06:56,318
Quiet!

960
02:06:58,362 --> 02:07:00,197
Where are they, Shichiroji?

961
02:07:00,405 --> 02:07:03,117
Beyond the fence.

962
02:07:17,506 --> 02:07:20,092
No doubt about it -- they're scouts.

963
02:07:20,634 --> 02:07:22,511
The fence took them by surprise.

964
02:07:23,637 --> 02:07:26,014
They don't seem
to realize we're here.

965
02:07:26,181 --> 02:07:29,309
With luck they'll report
there are only farmers here.

966
02:07:30,853 --> 02:07:33,438
<i>Hey, where is everyone?</i>

967
02:07:33,647 --> 02:07:35,315
That idiot!

968
02:07:36,358 --> 02:07:38,277
Kikuchiyo!

969
02:07:44,533 --> 02:07:46,869
Hey, I hear the bandits are here.

970
02:07:48,537 --> 02:07:49,329
You fool.

971
02:07:49,538 --> 02:07:51,832
Too late.
They've seen us.

972
02:08:02,718 --> 02:08:06,180
If they report back that samurai
are here, we're finished.

973
02:08:07,097 --> 02:08:10,184
I'll kill them.
The mountain's my territory.

974
02:08:10,559 --> 02:08:11,560
I was just --

975
02:08:11,768 --> 02:08:15,522
Enough. You can make up for it
by getting one.

976
02:08:15,731 --> 02:08:17,065
Head them off at --

977
02:08:17,274 --> 02:08:20,110
I know, at their horses.
Take us there.

978
02:08:21,278 --> 02:08:22,863
Katsushiro!

979
02:08:23,739 --> 02:08:26,241
Just watch, you understand?

980
02:08:33,332 --> 02:08:35,501
Those are some horses!

981
02:08:40,339 --> 02:08:42,216
Wait in this hollow.

982
02:08:51,099 --> 02:08:53,811
- What do you plan to do?
- Who, me?

983
02:10:54,223 --> 02:10:56,391
Katsushiro.

984
02:10:57,226 --> 02:10:59,436
You can come out now.

985
02:11:02,773 --> 02:11:04,608
Help me!

986
02:11:23,710 --> 02:11:25,420
Back off!

987
02:11:26,755 --> 02:11:31,009
He's a captive who has confessed.
He's begging for his life.

988
02:11:31,218 --> 02:11:34,638
You can't just
chop him to pieces.

989
02:11:35,973 --> 02:11:37,182
Stay out of this!

990
02:11:38,934 --> 02:11:41,145
Let me do it! Scum!

991
02:11:59,246 --> 02:12:00,998
All right.

992
02:12:01,457 --> 02:12:04,084
Let her avenge her son's death.

993
02:12:06,462 --> 02:12:09,173
Someone help her!

994
02:12:09,381 --> 02:12:10,966
I'll do it!

995
02:12:19,850 --> 02:12:23,604
- That bandit said their fort --
- It's hardly a fort.

996
02:12:23,812 --> 02:12:27,649
It's full of holes,
like Yohei's underwear.

997
02:12:27,816 --> 02:12:30,152
- Easy to sneak in.
- Let's attack at night.

998
02:12:30,319 --> 02:12:33,906
They have 40 men.
We'd usually pick off a few first.

999
02:12:34,114 --> 02:12:37,034
Wait. We can't afford
to lose a single man,

1000
02:12:37,242 --> 02:12:39,661
even if we kill five
for every one lost.

1001
02:12:39,828 --> 02:12:44,374
- War is always a gamble.
- Three of us can take 10 of them.

1002
02:12:45,417 --> 02:12:46,919
Rikichi.

1003
02:12:47,127 --> 02:12:50,047
How far away is their hideout?

1004
02:12:50,255 --> 02:12:51,715
At least a day.

1005
02:12:51,924 --> 02:12:54,718
Hey, we've got
three of their horses.

1006
02:12:54,927 --> 02:12:56,970
Half a day by horse.

1007
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:11,627
Very well. Let's do it.

1008
02:13:11,835 --> 02:13:14,755
If we leave now,
we'll arrive before dawn.

1009
02:13:14,963 --> 02:13:16,673
But who should go?

1010
02:13:19,885 --> 02:13:21,011
Not you.

1011
02:13:23,764 --> 02:13:26,058
And me makes three.

1012
02:13:26,975 --> 02:13:28,852
They need a guide!

1013
02:13:29,061 --> 02:13:31,438
There aren't enough horses.

1014
02:13:31,647 --> 02:13:33,649
There's Yohei's horse.
You ride that.

1015
02:13:33,857 --> 02:13:36,068
The only man
to master that steed

1016
02:13:36,276 --> 02:13:37,820
is Lord Kikuchiyo himself.

1017
02:13:46,954 --> 02:13:49,123
Whoa! What the hell?

1018
02:13:49,998 --> 02:13:52,167
It's the other way!

1019
02:13:54,628 --> 02:13:56,463
Stupid horse!

1020
02:13:57,131 --> 02:14:01,051
This way, you useless mule!

1021
02:14:01,844 --> 02:14:04,388
You call yourself a horse?

1022
02:14:04,596 --> 02:14:06,682
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

1023
02:14:08,642 --> 02:14:10,436
Hey, wait!

1024
02:14:12,771 --> 02:14:16,567
Please stop!
I apologize!

1025
02:14:16,775 --> 02:14:18,235
I'm sorry!

1026
02:15:44,822 --> 02:15:47,241
Hey, let's set the place on fire!

1027
02:15:47,449 --> 02:15:49,326
Cut 'em down as they run out!

1028
02:18:23,689 --> 02:18:25,649
Serves you right!

1029
02:18:26,316 --> 02:18:28,026
We did it!

1030
02:18:30,487 --> 02:18:32,448
Take that, you sons of bitches!

1031
02:19:15,491 --> 02:19:16,784
Heihachi!

1032
02:19:37,638 --> 02:19:39,932
Are you crazy?

1033
02:19:55,739 --> 02:19:56,949
Stupid idiot!

1034
02:19:57,157 --> 02:20:00,369
Look what you've done!
Who is she to you?

1035
02:20:01,745 --> 02:20:04,081
She's my wife!

1036
02:20:07,709 --> 02:20:10,421
Heihachi, hang on!

1037
02:20:49,626 --> 02:20:51,253
You said...

1038
02:20:53,297 --> 02:20:56,300
he'd be a treasure
in hard times.

1039
02:20:58,093 --> 02:21:00,429
The hard times
have only just begun.

1040
02:21:10,564 --> 02:21:11,774
Stop crying!

1041
02:21:12,524 --> 02:21:14,568
Damn fool!

1042
02:21:15,861 --> 02:21:17,488
Stop crying!

1043
02:22:45,409 --> 02:22:47,494
Goddamn!
Here they come!

1044
02:24:00,734 --> 02:24:04,488
Take note:
They have three muskets.

1045
02:24:30,180 --> 02:24:32,307
Twenty riders bound north,
13 south.

1046
02:24:32,516 --> 02:24:34,643
- Muskets?
- Three in all.

1047
02:24:35,853 --> 02:24:38,856
Take the south, and watch out
for those muskets.

1048
02:25:35,204 --> 02:25:37,498
Retreat! Retreat!

1049
02:25:53,138 --> 02:25:56,642
- The 12 headed south have turned east.
- Wasn't that 13?

1050
02:25:56,892 --> 02:25:58,811
An arrow got one of them.

1051
02:25:59,019 --> 02:26:00,562
Good old Gorobei.

1052
02:26:03,357 --> 02:26:06,610
Make sure the eastern bridge is out,
and watch out for --

1053
02:26:06,819 --> 02:26:08,320
The muskets!

1054
02:26:17,412 --> 02:26:20,958
Take the north.
That's where we'll battle it out.

1055
02:26:21,959 --> 02:26:25,379
If you knew that, why didn't
you build a fence there too?

1056
02:26:25,587 --> 02:26:27,965
Every great castle
needs a breach.

1057
02:26:28,173 --> 02:26:32,428
Draw the enemy there and attack.
You can't win by defense alone.

1058
02:26:44,189 --> 02:26:46,316
Use your balls,
if you've got any!

1059
02:26:50,446 --> 02:26:52,948
Take it away, damn it!

1060
02:26:56,493 --> 02:26:59,204
Twelve riders are on the way.
Hurry with the bridge!

1061
02:26:59,455 --> 02:27:02,124
Are you blind?
What do you think we're doing?

1062
02:27:04,084 --> 02:27:06,462
And he said
to watch out for the muskets.

1063
02:27:06,670 --> 02:27:08,630
What kinda idiot
you take me for?

1064
02:27:15,304 --> 02:27:16,638
Where are you going?

1065
02:27:16,847 --> 02:27:19,641
We're looking for Father.
We can't find him anywhere.

1066
02:27:19,975 --> 02:27:24,521
Father intends to die in that barn.
That's what he's always wanted.

1067
02:27:30,277 --> 02:27:32,404
Stubborn old fool!

1068
02:27:32,946 --> 02:27:35,115
Hurry up and get him!

1069
02:27:38,702 --> 02:27:40,746
Get out of our way!

1070
02:27:41,705 --> 02:27:45,042
What are you doing?
Hurry up!

1071
02:28:06,855 --> 02:28:09,149
- On this mountain --
- Twenty riders.

1072
02:28:09,566 --> 02:28:12,152
And 12 to the east.

1073
02:28:12,361 --> 02:28:13,737
Right.

1074
02:28:29,586 --> 02:28:32,673
This won't do.
They're all scared stiff.

1075
02:28:36,552 --> 02:28:38,095
Good! Again!

1076
02:28:39,721 --> 02:28:41,223
Again!

1077
02:28:44,601 --> 02:28:47,771
Shichiroji's at it.
Let's fire ours up too.

1078
02:28:49,314 --> 02:28:50,983
Everybody out here!

1079
02:28:56,280 --> 02:28:58,740
Raise your spears
and give the battle cry.

1080
02:29:03,412 --> 02:29:04,288
Again!

1081
02:29:08,667 --> 02:29:11,587
Damn 'em, listen to that!
We can beat 'em!

1082
02:29:15,507 --> 02:29:18,135
Yohei, what's that look for?
Again!

1083
02:29:23,348 --> 02:29:25,267
Take cover!

1084
02:29:30,022 --> 02:29:31,857
Here they come!

1085
02:29:48,499 --> 02:29:49,917
Goddamn 'em!

1086
02:30:26,203 --> 02:30:29,331
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

1087
02:30:33,710 --> 02:30:35,921
Oh, no, you don't!

1088
02:30:40,717 --> 02:30:42,302
Don't panic!

1089
02:30:51,228 --> 02:30:53,647
Goddamn you!

1090
02:30:57,734 --> 02:30:59,194
They're burning!

1091
02:30:59,611 --> 02:31:01,488
Damn bastards!

1092
02:31:31,310 --> 02:31:34,354
Back to your posts, everyone!

1093
02:31:35,564 --> 02:31:37,232
Dear!

1094
02:31:39,193 --> 02:31:41,904
They're just rickety shacks!

1095
02:31:44,865 --> 02:31:47,826
Everybody, back to your posts!

1096
02:31:59,338 --> 02:32:00,839
Goddamn it!

1097
02:32:02,591 --> 02:32:04,259
You dogs!

1098
02:32:04,593 --> 02:32:07,137
That's the Old Man's house!

1099
02:32:09,723 --> 02:32:12,392
Where's the Old Man?
What about that couple?

1100
02:32:12,893 --> 02:32:15,854
And the little brat?
What the hell's going on?

1101
02:32:18,982 --> 02:32:21,902
Stop!
You can't abandon your post!

1102
02:32:23,862 --> 02:32:25,906
Kikuchiyo, come back!

1103
02:32:28,033 --> 02:32:29,493
Kikuchiyo!

1104
02:32:44,675 --> 02:32:47,469
Where's the Old Man
and your husband?

1105
02:32:57,479 --> 02:33:00,399
She's been speared.
How'd she make it this far?

1106
02:33:06,905 --> 02:33:08,782
Let's go!

1107
02:33:15,372 --> 02:33:17,499
Damn it, what is it now?

1108
02:33:20,711 --> 02:33:23,380
This baby... is me.

1109
02:33:23,881 --> 02:33:26,383
This is just
what happened to me!

1110
02:34:35,202 --> 02:34:37,079
Here we go!

1111
02:34:45,838 --> 02:34:47,881
What the hell?

1112
02:35:02,146 --> 02:35:04,648
What the hell
were you staring at?

1113
02:35:05,816 --> 02:35:07,401
Idiot!

1114
02:36:09,713 --> 02:36:11,757
No one wounded?

1115
02:36:12,174 --> 02:36:14,593
Good.
You did a fine job.

1116
02:36:14,802 --> 02:36:16,428
Fine job!

1117
02:36:19,807 --> 02:36:22,017
Gunpowder!
Take cover!

1118
02:36:32,569 --> 02:36:34,238
Manzo!

1119
02:36:48,043 --> 02:36:49,962
Where were you hit?

1120
02:36:50,504 --> 02:36:53,632
Shino! Shino!
Bring me my daughter.

1121
02:36:54,883 --> 02:36:56,260
Don't bother.

1122
02:36:56,677 --> 02:36:59,555
If this kills you,
you'd die of a fleabite.

1123
02:37:00,806 --> 02:37:03,350
You make a ruckus
over a little scratch

1124
02:37:03,559 --> 02:37:07,396
and blow your daughter's cover
in the process. Nice going!

1125
02:37:36,800 --> 02:37:39,011
You don't have
to chase them all down.

1126
02:37:42,473 --> 02:37:44,516
That's far enough.
Well done.

1127
02:37:45,309 --> 02:37:47,186
Who are you?

1128
02:37:49,104 --> 02:37:50,773
Rikichi.

1129
02:38:05,829 --> 02:38:08,290
They've attacked from the east,
west and south

1130
02:38:08,499 --> 02:38:11,460
and run away each time
with their tails between their legs.

1131
02:38:11,668 --> 02:38:13,378
This is the only approach left.

1132
02:38:13,587 --> 02:38:16,173
We don't know
if they'll come tonight,

1133
02:38:16,381 --> 02:38:18,467
but when they do,
they'll mass their forces here.

1134
02:38:18,675 --> 02:38:20,344
Perhaps, but...

1135
02:38:21,053 --> 02:38:23,097
I don't hear a thing.

1136
02:38:36,193 --> 02:38:37,903
Nevertheless,

1137
02:38:38,695 --> 02:38:40,989
this will surely
be the focus of their attack.

1138
02:38:41,448 --> 02:38:43,367
I'll prove it to you in a minute.

1139
02:39:27,411 --> 02:39:28,746
Good work.

1140
02:39:28,912 --> 02:39:31,957
Now poke that scarecrow out
from behind those trees.

1141
02:40:06,533 --> 02:40:09,578
I'd say tomorrow morning

1142
02:40:09,953 --> 02:40:12,414
they'll attack us here
with everything they've got.

1143
02:40:12,623 --> 02:40:15,501
And we'll let them in.

1144
02:40:19,463 --> 02:40:22,591
Don't worry.
I mean we'll let one in.

1145
02:40:23,675 --> 02:40:25,636
Two at most.

1146
02:40:26,637 --> 02:40:30,307
Once they're in,
we form a wall again with our spears.

1147
02:40:31,058 --> 02:40:33,894
The one or two who get in
are as good as dead.

1148
02:40:34,103 --> 02:40:36,105
We can cook 'em up
any way we want.

1149
02:40:38,440 --> 02:40:42,986
We'll pick them off patiently,
one by one, until the final showdown.

1150
02:40:43,195 --> 02:40:45,197
Those muskets worry me.

1151
02:40:45,405 --> 02:40:47,533
If only we could
get one of them.

1152
02:40:50,160 --> 02:40:53,455
I'll go.
I swear I'll get one!

1153
02:40:53,664 --> 02:40:56,583
No. You're looking to die.
I'll go.

1154
02:41:49,762 --> 02:41:51,638
Footsteps! Listen!

1155
02:41:51,847 --> 02:41:55,058
That's enough.
Get some rest.

1156
02:41:55,267 --> 02:41:58,228
It's true! I hear them!
Listen.

1157
02:41:58,437 --> 02:42:00,522
I said enough.

1158
02:42:01,440 --> 02:42:04,526
You're exhausted.
Get some rest.

1159
02:42:07,321 --> 02:42:08,989
I hear them.

1160
02:42:37,184 --> 02:42:38,894
Two more down.

1161
02:43:13,929 --> 02:43:15,097
What is it?

1162
02:43:18,225 --> 02:43:22,271
State your business.
I'm going to get some sleep.

1163
02:43:23,814 --> 02:43:27,276
You are a magnificent person.

1164
02:43:31,655 --> 02:43:35,701
I've wanted to tell you so
for some time.

1165
02:44:01,727 --> 02:44:03,437
They're here.

1166
02:44:07,566 --> 02:44:09,526
We'll let one in.

1167
02:44:12,362 --> 02:44:14,281
We're letting one in!

1168
02:44:21,747 --> 02:44:26,210
Remember, after the first one's in,
jump out with your spears.

1169
02:44:45,145 --> 02:44:46,355
Here they come.

1170
02:45:22,349 --> 02:45:24,059
Step aside!

1171
02:45:26,645 --> 02:45:28,147
Good work.

1172
02:45:35,904 --> 02:45:38,907
What's wrong?
You did well.

1173
02:45:39,450 --> 02:45:41,368
Here he comes!
Scatter!

1174
02:45:58,969 --> 02:46:01,138
Fall back! Fall back!

1175
02:46:06,810 --> 02:46:08,854
After them!

1176
02:46:17,196 --> 02:46:18,822
Another on the way!

1177
02:48:01,175 --> 02:48:02,885
Here he comes.

1178
02:48:19,151 --> 02:48:20,903
Watch this!

1179
02:48:26,909 --> 02:48:29,578
Having fun
with your horsey?

1180
02:48:51,391 --> 02:48:55,896
They've stopped.
Won't fall for that trick again, eh?

1181
02:49:04,863 --> 02:49:07,991
They're all wimps!
Who's scared of bandits anyway?

1182
02:49:14,957 --> 02:49:20,170
That little skirmish just cost them four.
Kyuzo got two last night.

1183
02:49:36,812 --> 02:49:39,022
That man is a true samurai.

1184
02:49:39,398 --> 02:49:42,025
He's fearless,
his swordsmanship is amazing,

1185
02:49:42,234 --> 02:49:43,902
and yet he's kind too.

1186
02:49:44,111 --> 02:49:47,781
He never once boasted
about capturing that musket.

1187
02:49:48,240 --> 02:49:52,703
He walked into a forest filled with bandits
as if on a mushroom hunt.

1188
02:49:54,121 --> 02:49:58,375
Fascinating.
I'm not bored at all, I swear.

1189
02:50:16,268 --> 02:50:18,145
Hey, Yohei.

1190
02:50:19,062 --> 02:50:20,564
Take over for me.

1191
02:50:23,734 --> 02:50:26,695
What's that face for?

1192
02:50:26,904 --> 02:50:29,031
There's no danger here now.

1193
02:50:30,699 --> 02:50:32,826
You make a great scarecrow.

1194
02:52:04,334 --> 02:52:05,586
Hear me good!

1195
02:52:06,670 --> 02:52:09,047
If anybody else turns yellow --

1196
02:52:15,262 --> 02:52:16,597
Out of my way!

1197
02:53:40,139 --> 02:53:41,348
Hey!

1198
02:53:45,144 --> 02:53:46,270
How's it goin'?

1199
02:53:46,478 --> 02:53:48,480
Man, they're a pain.

1200
02:53:48,814 --> 02:53:50,899
Won't be long now.

1201
02:53:51,358 --> 02:53:54,570
Everything's upside down.

1202
02:53:54,778 --> 02:53:58,574
They burn us out,
and we starve like farmers.

1203
02:53:59,450 --> 02:54:02,244
Quit your moaning.
There are better times ahead.

1204
02:54:02,453 --> 02:54:04,747
Do your part, man.

1205
02:54:44,495 --> 02:54:46,622
Hey, it's me!

1206
02:54:53,962 --> 02:54:55,631
Serves you right, you dogs!

1207
02:54:55,839 --> 02:54:56,840
Fool!

1208
02:54:58,008 --> 02:55:00,010
Why did you leave your post?

1209
02:55:00,219 --> 02:55:01,553
Just look at this!

1210
02:55:01,762 --> 02:55:05,349
Don't scold me, man.
My post is fine.

1211
02:55:06,225 --> 02:55:09,728
There's nothing heroic
about selfishly grabbing for glory.

1212
02:55:09,937 --> 02:55:14,108
Listen to me:
War is not fought alone!

1213
02:55:24,535 --> 02:55:27,496
Gorobei and Kyuzo,
guard this post!

1214
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,002
Let no one pass!

1215
02:57:43,963 --> 02:57:46,716
Stop, you asses!

1216
02:57:46,924 --> 02:57:48,593
Damn you!

1217
02:57:49,260 --> 02:57:51,220
Damn it! Two made it in!

1218
02:58:06,944 --> 02:58:09,947
Goddamn it!

1219
02:58:10,698 --> 02:58:12,241
Where's Yohei?

1220
02:58:52,281 --> 02:58:53,574
Yohei!

1221
02:58:55,243 --> 02:58:56,577
Yohei!

1222
02:58:57,120 --> 02:59:00,248
I defended my post.

1223
02:59:00,456 --> 02:59:03,084
Don't give up, Yohei!

1224
02:59:06,462 --> 02:59:08,297
Go ahead, shoot me!

1225
02:59:46,335 --> 02:59:48,045
Shichiroji, take over!

1226
02:59:59,348 --> 03:00:01,184
Gorobei!

1227
03:00:10,860 --> 03:00:12,862
Gorobei!

1228
03:01:04,831 --> 03:01:07,041
Just 13 left.

1229
03:01:07,708 --> 03:01:09,710
But these last seven...

1230
03:01:11,003 --> 03:01:13,047
came at a steep price.

1231
03:01:34,277 --> 03:01:36,946
How are you? Tired?

1232
03:01:38,906 --> 03:01:42,785
Poor man.
You've lost a lot of weight.

1233
03:01:46,998 --> 03:01:49,500
I'll go throw
some water on my face.

1234
03:02:00,136 --> 03:02:02,763
<i>Next time they come,
we fight to the finish.</i>

1235
03:02:02,972 --> 03:02:07,226
It's better we fight it out
before we're spent.

1236
03:02:07,477 --> 03:02:11,022
When do you think
they'll attack?

1237
03:02:12,482 --> 03:02:15,443
They're exhausted too,
and a few are wounded.

1238
03:02:15,902 --> 03:02:17,945
They won't come tonight.

1239
03:02:18,154 --> 03:02:23,367
But they have no food,
and their ranks are splitting.

1240
03:02:24,327 --> 03:02:26,370
They can't afford
to dawdle either.

1241
03:02:26,662 --> 03:02:32,794
I say they'll come at us like hell
tomorrow morning.

1242
03:02:34,170 --> 03:02:35,797
Katsushiro.

1243
03:02:55,358 --> 03:02:56,818
An order from above.

1244
03:02:57,026 --> 03:03:00,154
Place two on watch
and let the rest sleep.

1245
03:03:00,863 --> 03:03:04,826
The men may visit their families
one at a time.

1246
03:03:06,702 --> 03:03:08,162
So tomorrow's the showdown?

1247
03:03:10,248 --> 03:03:12,416
Yes.
Please carry out the order.

1248
03:03:19,173 --> 03:03:22,927
You all heard what he just said.

1249
03:03:26,973 --> 03:03:29,350
I'll stand guard.

1250
03:03:30,017 --> 03:03:31,853
The rest of you sleep.

1251
03:03:32,895 --> 03:03:36,065
Manzo...

1252
03:03:36,899 --> 03:03:38,901
you go home first.

1253
03:03:39,360 --> 03:03:41,696
Take a good look
at your daughter --

1254
03:03:42,572 --> 03:03:44,782
I mean, your son.

1255
03:03:53,833 --> 03:03:55,084
I told them.

1256
03:03:55,293 --> 03:03:57,420
All right. Get some rest.

1257
03:04:01,507 --> 03:04:03,801
Katsushiro.

1258
03:04:04,760 --> 03:04:06,304
How was Kikuchiyo?

1259
03:04:06,512 --> 03:04:09,557
Still beside the grave.

1260
03:04:09,849 --> 03:04:11,058
I see.

1261
03:05:24,465 --> 03:05:27,260
Are we all going
to die tomorrow?

1262
03:05:27,468 --> 03:05:30,513
There's no way to know.

1263
03:05:31,180 --> 03:05:33,683
But we might!

1264
03:05:55,955 --> 03:05:57,331
Shino.

1265
03:05:57,999 --> 03:05:59,625
Where's Shino?

1266
03:06:05,339 --> 03:06:06,841
Anyone seen Shino?

1267
03:06:41,375 --> 03:06:43,920
Sake, eh?
Where'd you find it?

1268
03:06:59,268 --> 03:07:02,230
I see. They have stockpiles,
just like Kikuchiyo said,

1269
03:07:02,438 --> 03:07:04,440
and tonight it all comes out.

1270
03:07:13,866 --> 03:07:16,410
I think I'll help myself.

1271
03:07:20,206 --> 03:07:21,707
Shino!

1272
03:07:47,567 --> 03:07:50,611
Here's some sake.
Drink up and get some sleep.

1273
03:07:55,908 --> 03:08:00,121
This is hardly like you.
You must rest for the battle tomorrow.

1274
03:08:11,757 --> 03:08:13,801
Shino!

1275
03:09:18,991 --> 03:09:20,827
<i>You tramp!</i>

1276
03:09:30,336 --> 03:09:33,381
You wench!

1277
03:09:37,301 --> 03:09:39,428
Stop this brutality!

1278
03:09:39,637 --> 03:09:43,891
What the hell's a farmer girl
doing with a samurai?

1279
03:10:09,417 --> 03:10:11,043
You slut!

1280
03:10:21,220 --> 03:10:22,722
Manzo.

1281
03:10:23,639 --> 03:10:26,142
Is this your daughter?

1282
03:10:32,648 --> 03:10:34,442
Tell me what happened.

1283
03:10:34,650 --> 03:10:38,988
You mentioned a samurai.
Who was it?

1284
03:10:40,615 --> 03:10:42,074
Manzo!

1285
03:10:51,834 --> 03:10:53,669
Manzo, say something.

1286
03:10:54,796 --> 03:10:56,297
Speak!

1287
03:11:28,704 --> 03:11:30,873
Are you Shino?

1288
03:11:50,143 --> 03:11:53,312
Manzo, don't be angry.

1289
03:11:54,814 --> 03:11:57,859
When the dawn threatens
our very lives,

1290
03:11:58,067 --> 03:12:01,362
the weight of it
makes us all a little reckless.

1291
03:12:07,243 --> 03:12:09,704
On the eve of decisive battles...

1292
03:12:11,330 --> 03:12:14,041
this often happens,
even inside castles.

1293
03:12:16,919 --> 03:12:20,965
Remember what it was to be young.
You can't blame them.

1294
03:12:21,924 --> 03:12:24,010
I can't forgive them.

1295
03:12:24,260 --> 03:12:27,388
I can't stand by when my only daughter
has been made damaged goods.

1296
03:12:42,028 --> 03:12:46,616
What's wrong with two people in love?
It's not like bandits took her!

1297
03:14:19,041 --> 03:14:23,296
They're wound up tight.
We need to loosen them up.

1298
03:14:31,387 --> 03:14:34,640
Everyone, the final battle
is here at last.

1299
03:14:37,685 --> 03:14:41,856
By the way, Katsushiro,
we expect much of you today.

1300
03:14:43,691 --> 03:14:46,694
As of last night,
you became a real man.

1301
03:15:04,754 --> 03:15:06,297
Hey!

1302
03:15:09,258 --> 03:15:12,386
Where's that fighting spirit?

1303
03:15:14,180 --> 03:15:17,725
You'll never win
with such long faces!

1304
03:15:31,322 --> 03:15:33,407
Kikuchiyo, what are you up to?

1305
03:15:33,616 --> 03:15:35,910
I can't kill five
with just one blade.

1306
03:15:51,634 --> 03:15:53,553
There are 13 left.

1307
03:15:54,762 --> 03:15:58,683
We'll let them all in.

1308
03:16:00,309 --> 03:16:02,687
Once they pass this point,

1309
03:16:03,229 --> 03:16:07,066
we close in from all sides
at the crossing.

1310
03:16:09,986 --> 03:16:14,115
Everything's riding
on this battle!

1311
03:16:44,437 --> 03:16:46,647
Here they come!

1312
03:17:10,004 --> 03:17:12,173
Here they come!

1313
03:17:36,697 --> 03:17:38,866
Shichiroji and Katsushiro,
go west!

1314
03:17:39,158 --> 03:17:41,410
Kyuzo, Kikuchiyo, east!

1315
03:19:22,929 --> 03:19:25,848
Katsushiro! Rikichi!

1316
03:19:26,057 --> 03:19:28,684
East! Go east!

1317
03:19:28,893 --> 03:19:30,728
East!

1318
03:19:47,829 --> 03:19:49,580
Shut up!

1319
03:19:50,039 --> 03:19:52,250
Scream and you're dead!

1320
03:20:39,672 --> 03:20:40,840
We did it!

1321
03:20:41,048 --> 03:20:42,341
We did it!

1322
03:20:42,550 --> 03:20:45,261
Head east!

1323
03:21:00,610 --> 03:21:02,987
Katsushiro, pull back!

1324
03:21:05,531 --> 03:21:07,742
Damn you!

1325
03:21:09,494 --> 03:21:10,912
Kikuchiyo!

1326
03:21:47,115 --> 03:21:49,200
Kikuchiyo!

1327
03:21:59,627 --> 03:22:02,672
Where are the bandits?

1328
03:22:02,880 --> 03:22:04,841
They're all dead!

1329
03:22:23,192 --> 03:22:25,987
Once more we survive.

1330
03:26:04,205 --> 03:26:07,875
In the end,
we lost this battle too.

1331
03:26:08,793 --> 03:26:10,002
What?

1332
03:26:10,878 --> 03:26:12,463
I mean,

1333
03:26:12,880 --> 03:26:15,424
the victory belongs
to those peasants.

1334
03:26:16,759 --> 03:26:18,553
Not to us.

1335
03:26:47,790 --> 03:26:52,670
THE END
