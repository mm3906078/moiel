1
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,559
Starling!

2
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,145
Starling.

3
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,775
Crawford wants to see you in his office.

4
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,486
Thank you, sir.

5
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,785
-Clarice.
-Hey.

6
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,047
Hey, I got right to the end.

7
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,586
So there shouldn't be any problem
if you could –

8
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,171
-You looking for Crawford?
-Yes, sir.

9
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,632
He should be back in a couple minutes.
Why don't you wait in his office.

10
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,925
Okay.

11
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,886
Then I think they were over into Flushing.

12
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,901
Starling. Clarice M.

13
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,237
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Mr. Crawford.

14
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,073
Sorry to pull you off the course
on such short notice.

15
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,744
Your instructors tell me you're doing well.
Top quarter of your class.

16
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:13,289
I hope so.
They haven't posted any grades yet.

17
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,125
A job's come up, and I thought about you.

18
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,878
Not a job really.
More of an interesting errand.

19
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,589
-Sit down.
-Yes, sir.

20
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:26,802
-I remember you from my seminar at UVA.
-Yeah.

21
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,971
You grilled me pretty hard, as I recall,

22
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,682
on the Bureau's civil rights record
in the Hoover years.

23
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,643
-I gave you an "A."
-A-minus, sir.

24
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,190
Let's see.
Double major – psych and criminology.

25
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:42,568
Graduated magna.
Summer internships at the Reitzinger Clinic.

26
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,196
It says here, when you graduate,

27
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,823
you wanna come to work for me
in behavioral science.

28
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,493
Yes. Very much, sir. Very much.

29
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,663
We're interviewing
all the serial killers now in custody

30
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,540
for a psycho-behavioral profile.

31
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,627
Could be a real help in unsolved cases.

32
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,296
Most of them have been happy to talk to us.

33
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,423
You spook easily, Starling?

34
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,801
Not yet, sir.

35
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,720
See, the one we want most
refuses to cooperate.

36
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:12,306
I want you to go after him again today
in the asylum.

37
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,141
Who's the subject?

38
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,352
The psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter.

39
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,813
"Hannibal the Cannibal."

40
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,524
I don't expect him to talk to you...

41
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,820
but I have to be able to say we tried.

42
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:29,031
So, if he won't cooperate,
I want just straight reporting –

43
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,075
how's he look, how's his cell look.

44
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,787
Is he sketching, drawing?
If he is, what's he sketching?

45
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,960
Here's a, uh, dossier on Lecter...

46
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,465
copy of our questionnaire,
and a special ID for you.

47
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,760
Have your memo on my desk
by 0800 Wednesday.

48
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,345
Okay.

49
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:56,600
Um, excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?

50
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,853
Lecter's been in prison
for so many years now.

51
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:02,106
Is there some connection
between him and Buffalo Bill maybe?

52
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,024
I wish there were.

53
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,943
I want your full attention, Starling.

54
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,112
Yes, sir.

55
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,573
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.

56
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,202
Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over
all the physical procedures used with him.

57
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:19,456
Do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever.

58
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,584
And you're to tell him nothing personal,
Starling.

59
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,879
Believe me, you don't want
Hannibal Lecter inside your head.

60
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,549
Just do your job,
but never forget what he is.

61
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,176
And what is that?

62
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,720
Oh, he's a monster.

63
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,597
Pure psychopath.

64
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,266
So rare to capture one alive.

65
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,978
From a research point of view,
Lecter is our most prized asset.

66
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,231
Well.

67
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,110
You know, we get a lot of detectives here,
but, I must say,

68
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,863
I can't ever remember one as attractive.

69
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,701
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?

70
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,705
Because this can be quite a fun town
if you have the right guide.

71
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:03,375
I'm sure this is a great town,
Dr. Chilton,

72
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,547
but, um, my instructions are to talk
to Dr. Lecter and report back this afternoon.

73
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:12,343
I see. Well, let's make this quick then.

74
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,261
We've tried to study him, of course,

75
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:17,223
but he's much too sophisticated
for the standard tests.

76
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,642
And, oh, my, does he hate us.

77
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,727
He thinks I'm his nemesis.

78
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,148
Crawford's very clever, isn't he, using you?

79
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:30,653
-What do you mean, sir?
-Pretty, young woman to turn him on.

80
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,781
I don't believe Lecter's
even seen a woman in eight years.

81
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:37,284
And, oh, are you ever his taste,
so to speak.

82
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,955
I graduated from UVA, Doctor.
It is not a charm school.

83
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,666
Good. Then you should be able
to remember the rules.

84
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,588
Do not touch the glass.
Do not approach the glass.

85
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:53,092
You pass him nothing but soft paper.
No pencils or pens.

86
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,219
No staples or paper clips in his paper.

87
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,763
Use the sliding food carrier.
No exceptions.

88
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,182
If he attempts to pass you anything,
do not accept it.

89
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,351
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, I understand, sir.

90
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:07,356
I'm going to show you
why we insist on such precautions.

91
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,109
On the afternoon of July 8, 1981,

92
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:13,195
he complained of chest pains
and was taken to the dispensary.

93
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,781
His mouthpiece and restraints
were removed for an EKG.

94
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,617
When the nurse leaned over him,
he did this to her.

95
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:26,083
The doctors managed to reset her jaw,
more or less, save one of her eyes.

96
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,086
His pulse never got above 85,

97
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,171
even when he ate her tongue.

98
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,383
-I keep him in here.
-Dr. Chilton.

99
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:40,306
Um, if Lecter feels that you're his enemy,

100
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,101
then, um, well, maybe we'll have more luck
if I go in by myself.

101
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,186
What do you think?

102
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:52,443
You might have suggested this
in my office and saved me the time.

103
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:57,906
Yes, sir, but then I – I would have missed
the pleasure of your company, sir.

104
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,162
When she's finished, bring her out.

105
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,817
Hi. I'm Barney.

106
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,278
He told you don't get near the glass?

107
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:39,448
-Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.
-Mm-hmm.

108
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,659
Nice to meet you, Clarice.
You can hang your coat up here if you like.

109
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,661
Oh, thank you. I will.

110
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,708
He's past the others – the last cell.

111
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,502
You keep to the right.

112
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:57,466
-I put out a chair for you.
-Oh, yes. That's very good. Thank you.

113
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:02,304
I'll be watching. You'll do fine.

114
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,234
Hi.

115
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,962
I can smell your cunt!

116
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,479
-Good morning.
-Dr. Lecter, my name is Clarice Starling.

117
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,064
May I speak with you?

118
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,192
You're one of Jack Crawford's, aren't you?

119
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,861
I am, yes.

120
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,905
May I see your credentials?

121
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,116
Certainly.

122
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,374
Closer, please.

123
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,003
Closer.

124
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:36,315
That expires in one week.
You're not real FBI, are you?

125
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,276
I'm still in training at the academy.

126
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,363
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?

127
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:47,201
Yes. I'm a student.
I'm here to learn from you.

128
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:51,038
Maybe you can decide for yourself
whether or not I'm qualified enough to do that.

129
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,623
Mmm.

130
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,586
That is rather slippery of you,
Agent Starling.

131
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,799
Sit. Please.

132
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:14,186
Now then, tell me,
what did Miggs say to you?

133
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,688
Multiple Miggs in the next cell.

134
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:20,317
He hissed at you. What did he say?

135
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,655
He said, "I can smell your cunt."

136
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,240
I see.

137
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,618
I myself cannot.

138
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,796
You use Evyan skin cream.

139
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,218
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps.

140
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,888
But not today.

141
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,767
Did you do all these drawings, Doctor?

142
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,352
Ah.

143
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,773
That is the Duomo seen from the Belvedere.

144
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,235
Do you know Florence?

145
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,196
All that detail just from memory, sir?

146
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:10,409
Memory, Agent Starling,
is what I have instead of a view.

147
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:16,373
Well, perhaps you'd care to lend us
your view on this questionnaire, sir.

148
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,251
Oh, no, no, no, no.

149
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,086
You were doing fine.

150
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,298
You had been courteous
and receptive to courtesy.

151
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:28,802
You had established trust
with the... embarrassing truth about Miggs.

152
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,848
And now this... ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire.

153
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,268
It won't do.

154
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,687
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor.

155
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,647
Either you will or you won't.

156
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:44,568
Yeah. Jack Crawford
must be very busy indeed

157
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,237
if he is recruiting help
from the student body.

158
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:50,324
Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill.

159
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,784
What a naughty boy he is.

160
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:56,538
Do you know why he's called "Buffalo Bill"?

161
00:15:56,623 --> 00:16:00,000
Please tell me. The newspapers won't say.

162
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,754
Well, it started as a bad joke
in Kansas City Homicide.

163
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:07,924
They said, "This one likes to skin his humps."

164
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:13,013
Why do you think he removes their skins,

165
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,806
Agent Starling?

166
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,017
Thrill me with your acumen.

167
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,561
It excites him.

168
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,648
Most serial killers keep some sort
of trophies from their victims.

169
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,567
-I didn't.
-No.

170
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,444
No, you ate yours.

171
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,282
You send that through now.

172
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,099
Hmm.

173
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,394
Oh, Agent Starling.

174
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,689
You think you can dissect me
with this blunt little tool?

175
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,401
No. I – I thought that your knowledge –

176
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,820
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

177
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:13,865
You know what you look like to me
with your good bag and your cheap shoes?

178
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,450
You look like a rube –

179
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:20,247
a well-scrubbed, hustling rube
with a little taste.

180
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,417
Good nutrition's given you
some length of bone,

181
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:26,753
but you're not more than one generation
from poor white trash,

182
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,839
are you, Agent Starling?

183
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:33,969
And that accent you've tried so desperately
to shed – pure West Virginia.

184
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,555
What does your father do?
Is he a coal miner?

185
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,181
Does he stink of the lamp?

186
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:41,143
And, oh, how quickly the boys found you –

187
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:44,813
all those tedious, sticky fumblings
in the back seats of cars

188
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,442
while you could only dream
of getting out, getting anywhere,

189
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:52,070
getting all the way to the FBI.

190
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,367
You see a lot, Doctor.

191
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,871
But are you strong enough to point

192
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,498
that high-powered perception at yourself?

193
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,210
What about it? Why don't you –
Why don't you look at yourself

194
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,629
and write down what you see?

195
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,382
Or maybe you're afraid to.

196
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,061
A census taker once tried to test me.

197
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:28,482
I ate his liver with some fava beans

198
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,734
and a nice Chianti.

199
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,870
You fly back to school now, little Starling.

200
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,498
Fly, fly, fly.

201
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,501
Fly, fly, fly.

202
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,294
Fly, fly, fly.

203
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,724
I bit my wrist so I could die.

204
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:06,311
Look at the blood!

205
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,897
--Gotcha!

206
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,149
Miggs! You stupid fuck!

207
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,487
I'm gonna kill him!

208
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:19,533
Agent Starling! Come back!
Agent Starling! Agent Starling!

209
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,953
I would not have had that happen to you.
Discourtesy is unspeakably ugly to me.

210
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,622
-Then do this test for me.
-No. But I will make you happy.

211
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,582
I'll give you a chance
for what you love most.

212
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,335
-And what is that, Doc –
-Advancement, of course. Listen carefully.

213
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,255
Look deep within yourself, Clarice Starling.

214
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:37,133
Go seek out Miss Mofet,
an old patient of mine – M-O-F-E-T.

215
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:41,054
Go. I don't think Miggs could manage again
quite so soon, even though he is crazy.

216
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,224
- Go now!

217
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,892
- Hi, Bill.

218
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,896
-Hey!
-Daddy!

219
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,063
Hey, Clarice.

220
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,567
Hello, my girl.

221
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:40,071
-Did you get any bad guys today, Daddy?
-No, angel. They all got away today.

222
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,656
Aw, shoot.

223
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,303
FBI! Hands up!

224
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,513
-Don't move!
-Turn around.

225
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,807
Hands behind your back. Thumbs up.

226
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,979
--You're dead, Starling.

227
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:15,148
--Johnson, good job.

228
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,983
Good entry. Good commands.

229
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:19,027
-Starling, where's your danger area?
-In the corner, sir.

230
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,487
-Did you check the corner?
-No, sir.

231
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:21,780
That's the reason you're dead.

232
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,949
3-109.

233
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:27,619
3-109. Breaking doors or windows

234
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,829
to enter or exit.

235
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,998
Uh, Rule 4-048.

236
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,936
Clarice. Phone. It's the guru.

237
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,020
-Crawford?
-Yeah.

238
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:55,105
Thanks, Ardelia.

239
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,941
-Starling?
-Sir.

240
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,693
Miggs is dead.

241
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,487
Dead?

242
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,406
How?

243
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,742
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him
all afternoon and Miggs crying.

244
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,453
They found him at bed check.
He'd swallowed his own tongue.

245
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,582
Starling?

246
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,043
Yeah. I'm – I'm still here, sir.

247
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:20,088
I just –
I don't know how to feel about this.

248
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:24,092
You don't have to feel any way about it.
Lecter did it to amuse himself.

249
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,345
Look, I know it got ugly today, but –

250
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,141
He mentioned a name at the end – a Mofet.

251
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,976
Any follow-up on her?

252
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,230
Uh, well, Lecter altered or destroyed most
of his patients' histories prior to capture,

253
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,232
so there's no record of anyone named Mofet.

254
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:45,196
But, um, I thought the "yourself" reference
was, uh, too hokey for Lecter.

255
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:48,033
So I figured, he's from Baltimore,

256
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:52,871
and I looked in the phone book,
and there's a Your Self Storage facility

257
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:55,498
right outside of downtown Baltimore, sir.

258
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:01,713
Unit 31 was leased for 10 years,

259
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,548
prepaid in full.

260
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,759
The contract was in the name

261
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,928
of a... Miss Hester Mofet.

262
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,515
So nobody's been in here since 1980?

263
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,851
Not to my knowledge.

264
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,772
Privacy is a great concern
to my customers.

265
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:21,649
Yes. I won't disturb anything. I promise.

266
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,985
I'll be outta here before you know it.

267
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,361
--Can I help you?

268
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:28,573
Yes, actually. I can't –

269
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:33,745
It's stuck.

270
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,581
You could return tomorrow with my son.

271
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:40,126
- What about him?

272
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,420
I would ask my driver to help you,

273
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,839
but he detests physical labor.

274
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,550
Right.

275
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,428
Well, you just stay here.
I'll be back in one minute.

276
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:24,045
--Stuck.

277
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,506
- Hand me that flashlight, sir.

278
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,643
Oh.

279
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:42,105
Um, if this door should fall down or –

280
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,190
anything else,

281
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:48,153
uh, this is the number
for our Baltimore field office.

282
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:52,657
Now, they know that you're with me.
You call them if anything should happen.

283
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,242
Yes, Miss Starling.

284
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,622
--Ow!

285
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,104
Clarice, I cleared the way for you.

286
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,648
-Watch yourself.
-Okay. Thanks.

287
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:34,193
"Hester Mofet."
It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor?

288
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,239
"Hester Mofet." "The rest of me."

289
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:42,785
"Miss the Rest of Me."
Meaning that you rented that garage?

290
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,490
Thank you.

291
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:21,991
Your bleeding has stopped.

292
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,037
How did you –

293
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:29,415
It's nothing.

294
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,751
It's just a scratch.

295
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,754
Dr. Lecter, whose head is in that bottle?

296
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,091
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?

297
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,009
Why, do you know something about him?

298
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:44,013
I might if I saw the case file.
You could get that for me.

299
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:47,475
Why don't we talk about Miss Mofet?
You wanted me to find him.

300
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,562
His real name is Benjamin Raspail.

301
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,942
A former patient of mine
whose romantic attachments ran

302
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:58,736
to, shall we say, the exotic.

303
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,947
I did not kill him, I assure you.

304
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:03,533
Merely tucked him away
very much as I found him

305
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:06,119
after he'd missed three appointments.

306
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:09,414
But... if you didn't kill him,
then who did, sir?

307
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:12,834
Who can say? Best thing for him really.

308
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:15,336
His therapy was going nowhere.

309
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:19,215
His dress, uh, makeup –

310
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,008
Raspail was a transvestite?

311
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,553
In life? Oh, no.

312
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,930
Garden-variety manic-depressive.

313
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,849
Tedious. Very tedious.

314
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,102
No, no. Just think of him
as a kind of experiment,

315
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,856
a fledgling killer's
first effort at transformation.

316
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,358
How did you feel when you saw him,
Clarice?

317
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:42,572
Scared at first, then... exhilarated.

318
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,366
Jack Crawford is helping your career,
isn't he?

319
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:48,286
Apparently he likes you, and you like him too.

320
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,955
I never thought about it.

321
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,083
Do you think Jack Crawford
wants you sexually?

322
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:55,710
True, he is much older,

323
00:29:55,794 --> 00:30:00,673
but do you think he visualizes scenarios,
exchanges, fucking you?

324
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,261
That doesn't interest me, Doctor.

325
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,848
And frankly, it's – it's the sort of thing
that Miggs would say.

326
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,643
Not anymore.

327
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,652
Thank you, Barney.

328
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,533
What happened to your drawings?

329
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,787
Punishment, you see. For Miggs.

330
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,581
Just like that gospel program.

331
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,709
When you leave,
they'll turn the volume way up.

332
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:40,171
Dr. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.

333
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,216
What did you mean by "transformation,"
Doctor?

334
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,977
I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice...

335
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:59,315
and I know they will never, ever
let me out while I'm alive.

336
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,485
What I want is a view.

337
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:06,489
I want a window
where I can see a tree or even water.

338
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:10,326
I want to be in a federal institution
far away from Dr. Chilton.

339
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,912
What did you mean by "fledgling killer"?

340
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,872
Are you saying that he's killed again?

341
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:18,376
I'm offering you
a psychological profile on Buffalo Bill

342
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,711
based on the case evidence.

343
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:28,344
I'll help you catch him, Clarice.

344
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,270
You know who he is, don't you?

345
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:40,982
Tell me who decapitated your patient, Doctor.

346
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,901
All good things to those who wait.

347
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:45,528
I've waited, Clarice.

348
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,447
But how long can you
and ol' Jackie boy wait?

349
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:54,245
Our little Billy must already
be searching for that next special lady.

350
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:58,976
Hey, little cheeper.

351
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,945
I'll be right there.

352
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:19,747
Goddamn.

353
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:30,091
Fuckin' – Geez.

354
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,391
Can I help you with that?

355
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,893
-Would you?
-Sure.

356
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,771
-Thank you.
-That's all right.

357
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,190
-You look kinda handicapped.
-Yeah.

358
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,151
I got it this far.
I just can't get it up in the truck.

359
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:51,237
I could use all the help I can get.
Just grab that.

360
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:52,738
- Up.
- Okay.

361
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:55,157
Yeah. Just set it down. That's good.

362
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:58,744
Uh, get in the truck,
and I wanna push it all the way up.

363
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,331
-I really appreciate this. Thank you.
-All right. Yeah.

364
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:05,418
Thank you. Now – Push it all the way back.

365
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,796
Okay. Is this good?

366
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,049
-Yeah, that's good. That's great.
-Ah –

367
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:14,009
-That's great.
-Okay.

368
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:18,764
-Hey, say, are you about a size 14?
-Sorry?

369
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:41,495
Good.

370
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:00,973
Oh, good.

371
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:03,768
Good.

372
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,868
--Hold!

373
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,839
--Starling!

374
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:39,470
Outside. Let's go.

375
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,389
Cindy! In the ring for Starling! Let's go!

376
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,566
-FBI! Hold it!
-Hold it right there!

377
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,611
Saddle up. Pack your field gear.
You're movin' out. You're goin' with Crawford.

378
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,780
-Where?
-They found a girl's body down in West Virginia.

379
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,783
Been in the water about a week.
Looks like a Buffalo Bill-type situation.

380
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,881
Keeps 'em alive for three days.
We don't know why.

381
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:19,134
There's no evidence of rape
or physical abuse prior to death.

382
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,887
All the mutilation you see there
is postmortem.

383
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,640
Okay. Three days.

384
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:28,060
Then he shoots them, skins them,
and dumps them –

385
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,187
each body in a different river.

386
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:33,357
The water leaves us
no trace evidence of any kind.

387
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,943
That's Frederica Bimmel, the first one.

388
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,071
Her body was the only one
he took the trouble to weight down,

389
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,949
so actually she was the third girl found.

390
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,034
After her, he got lazy.

391
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,039
Okay. Let's see.

392
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,500
Circles where the girls were abducted.

393
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:53,460
Arrows where their bodies were found.

394
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:57,131
This new one today washed up here.

395
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,716
Elk River, West Virginia.

396
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,321
Look at 'em, Starling.
Tell me what you see.

397
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:23,908
Well, he's a white male.

398
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,744
Uh, serial killers tend to hunt
within their own ethnic groups.

399
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,746
Um, he's not a drifter.

400
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,082
He's got his own... house somewhere,
not an apartment.

401
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:36,045
-Why?
-What he does with them takes privacy.

402
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:38,088
He's in his 30s or 40s.

403
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:43,385
He's got real physical strength,
combined with an older man's self-control.

404
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,679
He's-He's cautious, precise.

405
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:49,433
And he's never impulsive.
He'll never stop.

406
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:51,852
Why not?

407
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:56,440
He's got a real taste for it now,
and he's getting better at his work.

408
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,945
Not bad, Starling. Questions?

409
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:06,450
Yes, sir. Um, you haven't mentioned anything
about the information contained in my report

410
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,535
or Dr. Lecter's offer, sir.

411
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,537
I'm considering it.

412
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,873
That's why you sent me in there, isn't it?

413
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,918
To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?

414
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:21,382
Well, if that was the case, then I just –

415
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:24,677
I just wish I was in on it, that's all.

416
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:27,221
If I'd sent you in there
with an actual agenda,

417
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,223
Lecter would have known it instantly.

418
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,059
He would have toyed with you,
then turned to stone.

419
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,680
Excuse me, Sheriff Perkins.
These are the FBI people.

420
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,516
Sheriff Perkins. Jack Crawford, FBI.

421
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,893
Special Agent Terry, Agent Starling.

422
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:17,771
We appreciate being invited
to your jurisdiction.

423
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,816
I didn't call you. That was somebody
from the state attorney's office.

424
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:23,485
We'll extend you every courtesy,
but right now I –

425
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,612
Sheriff.

426
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,823
This type of sex crime has certain aspects

427
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,409
I'd just as soon discuss in private.

428
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,202
Know what I mean?

429
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,564
--Oscar.

430
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,524
- Fetch Dr. Akin from the chapel.
- Yes, sir.

431
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,442
Starling, we're back here.

432
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:30,154
Tell Lamar to come on
when he's finished playing his music.

433
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:33,365
- Yeah, we'll be sending in a minute.

434
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,661
- I need a – I need a six-way link-up.

435
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,414
Chicago, Detroit – What? What?

436
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,962
Uh, excuse me.

437
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,714
Excuse me, gentlemen.

438
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:52,593
You officers and gentlemen, listen here now.
There's things we need to do for her.

439
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,469
I know that you all brought her this far

440
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,513
and that her folks would thank you
if they could

441
00:41:56,598 --> 00:42:00,017
for your – for your kindness
and your sensitivity.

442
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:02,186
But now, please, go on now
and let us take care of her.

443
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:05,230
Go on now.

444
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,819
- Thank you.

445
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:15,490
Thank you.

446
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:18,243
Okay, good.

447
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,921
Yeah, that's right.
West Vir – Yeah. Elk River.

448
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,964
Stand by for transmission.

449
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,261
Ray.

450
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:51,109
Doctor, Lamar, let's take a look at her.

451
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:10,629
- Jesus.

452
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,053
Okay, Starling.

453
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,434
Bill.

454
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,078
Star-shaped contact entrance wound

455
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,330
over the, uh, sternum.

456
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,501
Um, muzzle stamp at the top.

457
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,837
- Wrongful death.
- Wrongful death.

458
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:56,091
She'll have to go
to the state pathologist at Claxton.

459
00:43:56,175 --> 00:44:00,012
Well, I-I'd better get back to that service.
Lamar'll help ya.

460
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:04,141
- Lord Almighty.

461
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,895
What else do you see, Starling?

462
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,524
Well, she's not local.

463
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:16,278
Her ears are pierced three times,
and there's, uh –

464
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,574
Uh, glitter nail polish.
It looks like town to me.

465
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:29,624
Two of her fingernails are broken off,
and there's, uh –

466
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,836
there's dirt or grit under them.

467
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,297
It looks like she's tried to claw her way
through something.

468
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:39,176
Ray, get pictures of her teeth.
We'll fax them to Missing Persons.

469
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,761
Right.

470
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,605
Let's do another.

471
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:02,366
She's got something in her throat.

472
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,702
When a body comes out of the water,

473
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:08,705
lots of times there's, like,
leaves and things in the mouth.

474
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:43,115
What is that, some kind of seed pod?

475
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:46,159
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.

476
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:49,663
But there's no way that could get
way down in there like that.

477
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,165
Not unless somebody shoved it in there.

478
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:56,920
She'll be easier to print when we turn her over.

479
00:45:57,004 --> 00:46:00,298
-Lamar, will you give me a hand with this?
-Yes, sir, I will.

480
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,096
Ooh, Jack.

481
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:08,515
-What do you make of these?
-Hmm.

482
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,685
Different configuration than the other victims.
Get close-ups.

483
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,645
The victim's skin removed at this time

484
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:16,857
in two large diamond-shaped sections
above the buttocks.

485
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:20,193
Stellate exit wound level with the second
or the third thoracic vertebrae,

486
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:23,363
approximately six inches
from the right shoulder blade.

487
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:24,865
Starling.

488
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:29,369
When – When I told that sheriff
we shouldn't talk in front of a woman,

489
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:31,455
that really burned you, didn't it?

490
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:34,332
It was just smoke, Starling.
I had to get rid of him.

491
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:39,504
It matters, Mr. Crawford.
Cops look at you to see how to act.

492
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:42,090
-It matters.
-Point taken.

493
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,682
Ligature marks found around the wrists,

494
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,726
not around the ankles.

495
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,562
This would indicate that the skinning
was postmortem.

496
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,547
- Time, Pilch. My move.
- No fair. You lured him with produce.

497
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:25,008
Tough noogies. Still my turn.

498
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:28,011
Nice and slow, baby.

499
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,805
If the beetle moves one of your men,
does that still count?

500
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,560
Of course it counts. How do you play?

501
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:37,687
Agent Starling?

502
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,483
Where the heck did this come from?

503
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,610
It's practically mush.

504
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,904
It was found behind the soft palate
of a murder victim.

505
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,156
The body was in the Elk River
in West Virginia.

506
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:51,409
-It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?
-I'm afraid I can't tell you any more about that.

507
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:52,827
We heard about it on the radio.

508
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:55,205
You mean this is, like,
a clue from a real murder case?

509
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:58,291
-Cool!
-Just ignore him. He's not a PhD.

510
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:02,128
A Sphingid ceratomia maybe.

511
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:04,297
Boy, he's a big sucker.

512
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:09,052
Okay. Let's check morphology.

513
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:16,685
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

514
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:20,230
What do you do when you're not detecting,
Agent Starling?

515
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,484
Try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.

516
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:26,987
You ever go out
for cheeseburgers and beer?

517
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:30,657
The amusing house wine?

518
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,701
Are you hitting on me, Doctor?

519
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:35,412
-Yes.
-Gotcha.

520
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:37,831
-What do you got, Roden?
-Agent Starling.

521
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:41,543
Meet Mr. Acherontia styx.

522
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,044
Weird.

523
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:46,172
Better known to his friends
as the death's-head moth.

524
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:49,175
-And where does it come from?
-That's what's strange.

525
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,927
-They only live in Asia.
-Asia?

526
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:53,805
In this country, they'd have to be
specially raised from imported eggs.

527
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:57,142
Uh, somebody grew this guy.
Fed him honey and nightshade.

528
00:48:57,226 --> 00:48:58,727
Kept him warm.

529
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,313
Somebody loved him.

530
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,037
Please.

531
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,840
Hello?

532
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:38,642
Where are you?

533
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:41,061
Let me out of here!

534
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,653
- Hey!

535
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:52,697
- Please help me!

536
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:56,993
Someone help me! Please!

537
00:49:57,078 --> 00:49:59,746
Why won't you answer me? Please!

538
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:06,002
-Good morning. I'm Donna Ferucci.
-I'm Gene Cassel with sports.

539
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:09,214
And I'm Tim Langhorn.
Our top story for this morning.

540
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:13,593
Catherine Martin, the 25-year-old
daughter of Senator Ruth Martin,

541
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:15,220
listed first as a missing person,

542
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:19,933
is now believed to have been kidnapped
by the serial killer known only as Buffalo Bill.

543
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,560
Memphis police sources indicate
that the missing girl's blouse –

544
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,813
-Thank you.
-has been identified – sliced up the back –

545
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:28,400
in what has become a kind of grim,
all-too-familiar calling card.

546
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:31,111
Young Catherine Martin, as we've said,
is the only daughter

547
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:34,698
of US Senator Ruth Martin,
the Republican junior senator from Tennessee.

548
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:38,451
And while her kidnapping is not at this point
considered to be politically motivated,

549
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:41,705
nevertheless, it has stirred the government
to its highest levels.

550
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:44,541
Reached for comment on the ski slopes
of Stowe, Vermont,

551
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:48,586
the president himself said to be,
and I quote, "intensely concerned."

552
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:50,714
-Just moments ago, Senator Martin –
-Excuse me.

553
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:52,841
taped this dramatic personal plea.

554
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:56,761
I'm speaking now
to the person who's holdin' my daughter.

555
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,182
Catherine is very gentle and kind.

556
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,185
Talk to her and you'll see.

557
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:07,647
You have the power.

558
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,733
You are in charge.

559
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:15,613
I know you can feel love and compassion.

560
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:21,077
You have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world

561
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:23,872
that you can be merciful as well as strong,

562
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,958
that you're big enough to treat Catherine

563
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,461
better than the world has treated you.

564
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:31,838
You have that power.

565
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:34,466
Please.

566
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,593
My daughter is Catherine.

567
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:38,887
- Boy, that's smart.
- Release her unharmed.

568
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:42,807
- Jesus, that's really smart.
- She keeps repeating the name.

569
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:46,102
If he sees Catherine as a person
and not just an object,

570
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:47,812
it's harder to tear her up.

571
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:50,190
Please, release my little girl.

572
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:54,444
What you're doing, Miss Starling,
is coming into my hospital

573
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:59,115
to conduct an interview and refusing to
share information with me for the third time.

574
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,661
Sir, I told you this is just a routine
follow-up on the Raspail case.

575
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:07,290
-He is my patient. I have rights.
-I understand that, sir.

576
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:11,878
Look, I am not just some turnkey,
Miss Starling.

577
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:15,298
This is the number
for the US Attorney's office.

578
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:18,843
Please, either you discuss this with him
or you let me do my job.

579
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:20,929
Do you understand?

580
00:52:25,226 --> 00:52:28,394
If your profile helps us catch Buffalo Bill

581
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,772
in time to save Catherine Martin...

582
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:34,317
the senator promises you a transfer

583
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:38,613
to the VA hospital at Oneida Park, New York,
with a view of the woods nearby.

584
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:41,491
Maximum security still applies, of course.

585
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:44,202
You'd have reasonable access to books.

586
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:47,413
Best of all though,

587
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:49,332
one week of the year,

588
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,376
you get to leave the hospital

589
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:53,586
and go here.

590
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:58,258
Plum Island.

591
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:02,846
Every day of that week,
you may walk on the beach,

592
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,557
you may swim in the ocean –
for up to one hour –

593
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:09,102
under SWAT team surveillance, of course.

594
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,437
--And there you have it.

595
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:17,735
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.

596
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:21,823
Copy of the senator's offer.

597
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:25,243
This offer is non-negotiable and final.

598
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,704
Catherine Martin dies, you get nothing.

599
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:42,010
"Plum Island
Animal Disease Research Center."

600
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:46,723
Sounds charming.

601
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:51,227
That's only part of the island.
There's a very – very nice beach.

602
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:53,605
Terns nest there. There's beautiful –

603
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:55,940
Terns? Mm.

604
00:53:56,901 --> 00:54:00,069
If I help you, Clarice,
it will be "turns" with us too.

605
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:03,323
Quid pro quo.
I tell you things, you tell me things.

606
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:06,159
Not about this case though.
About yourself.

607
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:09,329
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?

608
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:15,376
Yes or no, Clarice?
Poor little Catherine is waiting.

609
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:17,962
Go, Doctor.

610
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:21,758
What is your worst memory of childhood?

611
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:25,803
Death of my father.

612
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:29,349
Tell me about it. And don't lie, or I'll know.

613
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:32,435
He was the town marshal, and...

614
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:35,355
one night he

615
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:39,400
surprised two burglars coming out
of the back of a drugstore.

616
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:42,737
They shot him.

617
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,156
Was he killed outright?

618
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:49,285
No. He was very strong.
He lasted more than a month.

619
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,581
My mother died when I was very young, so –

620
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,126
My father had become the whole world to me,

621
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:59,671
and, uh, when he left me, I had nothing.

622
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:01,381
I was 10 years old.

623
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,550
You're very frank, Clarice.

624
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:09,722
I think it would be quite something
to know you in private life.

625
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,102
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

626
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:19,691
So tell me about Miss West Virginia.
Was she a large girl?

627
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,779
-Yes.
-Big through the hips?

628
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:27,407
-Roomy?
-They all were.

629
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,492
What else?

630
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:33,329
She had an object deliberately inserted
into her throat.

631
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:38,084
Now, that hasn't been made public yet.
We don't know what it means.

632
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,877
Was it a butterfly?

633
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:43,339
Yes. A moth.

634
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:48,761
Just like the one we found
in Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.

635
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,056
Why does he place them there, Doctor?

636
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:56,394
The significance of the moth is change.

637
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,897
Caterpillar into chrysalis or pupa...

638
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,900
and, from thence, into beauty.

639
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,279
Our Billy wants to change too.

640
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:10,742
There's no correlation in the literature
between transsexualism and violence.

641
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:13,703
-Transsexuals are very passive.
-Clever girl.

642
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:17,665
You're so close to the way you're
gonna catch him. Do you realize that?

643
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:19,834
No. Tell me why.

644
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:22,712
After your father's murder, you were orphaned.

645
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,380
What happened next?

646
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:32,472
I don't imagine the answer is
on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.

647
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:36,684
I went to live with my mother's cousin
and her husband in Montana.

648
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:38,061
They had a ranch.

649
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:40,063
Was it a cattle ranch?

650
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:42,190
Sheep and horses.

651
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:43,983
How long did you live there?

652
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:46,110
Two months.

653
00:56:46,195 --> 00:56:47,737
Why so briefly?

654
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:49,405
I ran away.

655
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,449
Why, Clarice?

656
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,951
Did the rancher make you perform fellatio?

657
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:55,953
Did he sodomize you?

658
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:59,832
No. He was a very decent man.

659
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:03,503
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

660
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,840
Billy is not a real transsexual.

661
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:10,009
But he thinks he is. He tries to be.

662
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:13,137
He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.

663
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:15,681
You said I was very close
to the way we would catch him.

664
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,391
What did you mean, Doctor?

665
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:19,894
There are three major centers
for transsexual surgery –

666
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:24,398
Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota,
and Columbus Medical Center.

667
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:27,693
I wouldn't be surprised
if Billy had applied for sex reassignment

668
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:29,445
at one or all of them

669
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,781
and been rejected.

670
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,783
On what basis would they reject him?

671
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:37,328
Look for severe childhood disturbances

672
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:39,497
associated with violence.

673
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,542
Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice.

674
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:46,796
He was made one
through years of systematic abuse.

675
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,424
Billy hates his own identity, you see,

676
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:53,261
and he thinks that makes him a transsexual.

677
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:57,265
But his pathology
is a thousand times more savage

678
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:59,350
and more terrifying.

679
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:06,399
It rubs lotion on its skin.
It does this whenever it's told.

680
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,402
Mister, my family will pay cash.

681
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,738
Whatever ransom you're askin' for,
they'll pay it.

682
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:18,119
It rubs the lotion on its skin,
or else it gets the hose again.

683
00:58:19,872 --> 00:58:22,456
Yes, it will, Precious.
It will get the hose.

684
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:25,835
Okay. Okay. Okay.

685
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:29,172
Okay. Okay.

686
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:30,756
Okay.

687
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,928
Mister, if you let me go, I won't –
I won't press charges.

688
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:38,097
I promise.

689
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:40,892
See, my mom is a real important woman.

690
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:43,102
I guess you already know that.

691
00:58:43,187 --> 00:58:45,813
Now it places the lotion in the basket.

692
00:58:46,607 --> 00:58:50,693
Please! Please! I want to go home.

693
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,821
I want to go home, please!

694
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:54,989
Please.

695
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,241
It places the lotion in the basket.

696
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:02,246
I want to see my mommy! Please –

697
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,167
I want to see my – I want –

698
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:09,503
I want – I want to see –

699
00:59:10,339 --> 00:59:13,966
- Put the fucking lotion in the basket!

700
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,545
You still think you're gonna walk
on some beach and see the birdies?

701
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:54,048
No, I don't think so.

702
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,010
I called Senator Ruth Martin.

703
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,763
She never heard of any deal with you.

704
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,724
They scammed you, Hannibal.

705
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:06,852
Stand outside.

706
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,814
And shut the door.

707
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:12,066
-Barney.
-Mm-hmm.

708
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:22,285
There never was a deal
with Senator Martin, but there is now.

709
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:23,577
I designed it.

710
01:00:23,662 --> 01:00:27,123
Of course, I worked in a few conditions
for my own benefit as well.

711
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:33,087
Identify Buffalo Bill by name,
and if the girl is found in time,

712
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,797
Senator Martin will have you transferred

713
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,091
to Brushy Mountain State Prison
in Tennessee.

714
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,094
Answer me, Hannibal.

715
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:46,642
You answer me now, or by God,
you'll never leave this cell.

716
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:50,938
Who is Buffalo Bill?

717
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:53,899
His first name is Louis.

718
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:58,321
I'll tell the rest to the senator herself,
but only in Tennessee.

719
01:00:58,405 --> 01:01:00,656
And I have a few conditions of my own.

720
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:05,453
Clean him up and get him ready to go.

721
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:09,957
Jack, Hannibal Lecter's
being transferred to Memphis.

722
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:11,625
Transferred?

723
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:16,130
Did you have a trainee make some sort of
phony offer to Lecter in the senator's name?

724
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,174
Yeah. I rolled the dice. I had to.

725
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:22,595
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.
Paul Krendler's over here from Justice.

726
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,930
She's asking him to take over in Memphis.

727
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:51,999
Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter.

728
01:01:52,084 --> 01:01:54,877
I'm Lieutenant Boyle.
This is Sergeant Patrick.

729
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:57,213
Now, we're gonna treat you
as good as you treat us.

730
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:59,965
You be a gentleman,
you're gonna get three hots and a cot.

731
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:04,887
Sir, if you'll sign right here,
we'll have us a legal transfer.

732
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:09,183
Where is it?

733
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,228
Here, sir. Use mine.

734
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:03,612
Senator Martin, Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

735
01:03:08,869 --> 01:03:10,077
Dr. Lecter.

736
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:13,873
I brought an affidavit
guaranteeing your new rights.

737
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,625
You'll want to read it before I sign.

738
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:24,633
I won't waste your time or Catherine's time
bargaining for petty privileges.

739
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,219
Clarice Starling
and that awful Jack Crawford

740
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:29,096
have wasted far too much time already.

741
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:32,141
I only pray
they haven't doomed the poor girl.

742
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:36,979
Let me help you now,
and I will trust you when it is all over.

743
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:38,898
You have my word. Paul?

744
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:44,695
Buffalo Bill's real name is Louis Friend.

745
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:47,072
I met him just once.

746
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:52,286
He was referred to me in April or May 1980
by my patient Benjamin Raspail.

747
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,580
They were lovers, you see.

748
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:58,959
But Raspail had become very frightened.

749
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:02,713
Apparently, Louis had murdered a transient

750
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:06,342
and done things with the skin.

751
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:10,137
We need his address
and a physical description.

752
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:12,890
Tell me, Senator,

753
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:16,185
did you nurse Catherine yourself?

754
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,854
-What?
-Did you breast-feed her?

755
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:21,815
-Wait a minute.
-Yes, I did.

756
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:25,402
-Toughened your nipples, didn't it?
-You son of a bitch!

757
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:29,740
Amputate a man's leg,
and he can still feel it tickling.

758
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:34,954
Tell me, Mom, when your little girl
is on the slab, where will it tickle you?

759
01:04:35,664 --> 01:04:38,749
Take this thing back to Baltimore.

760
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:43,212
Five-foot-ten, strongly built,
about 180 pounds.

761
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:47,424
Hair blond, eyes pale blue.
He'd be about 35 now.

762
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:49,969
He said he lived in Philadelphia
but may have lied.

763
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:52,513
That's all I can remember, Mom.

764
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:55,307
But if I think of any more,
I will let you know.

765
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:00,187
Oh, and, Senator, just one more thing.

766
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:04,108
Love your suit.

767
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,529
I can tell you now
that in a meeting earlier this evening

768
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:12,992
with Senator Ruth Martin, Dr. Lecter
agreed to assist in the investigation

769
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:16,161
of trying to find the abductor
of Catherine Martin, Buffalo Bill.

770
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:18,414
-How do you fit in, sir?
-It's through my unique insight

771
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:20,541
into Lecter's mind
that this breakthrough was possible.

772
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:21,834
And Buffalo Bill's real name?

773
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:25,796
Buffalo Bill's real name is now a matter
of record with the proper authorities.

774
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,465
-Can you give us more information?
-My name is Dr. Frederick Chilton.

775
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:30,092
-How do you spell that?
-That's C-H –

776
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:33,178
Are you with Dr. Chilton's group?

777
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,931
Uh, well, I just saw him outside, sir.

778
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:40,102
Access to Lecter is strictly limited.
We've been getting death threats.

779
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:41,729
I understand, sir.

780
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:49,486
Log in and check your weapon.

781
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:53,240
I can't take all the credit for myself.

782
01:05:53,325 --> 01:05:55,034
Senator Martin, the Justice Department,

783
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:58,078
people at the FBI,
the folks at the Baltimore State Hospital.

784
01:05:58,163 --> 01:06:00,706
And now for the hard part,
apprehending the suspect.

785
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:04,168
- Excuse me, folks. I have to catch a flight.

786
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:09,798
Command desk. Officer Jacobs.

787
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,810
- Is it true what they're saying?
- Huh?

788
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:25,356
He's some kind of vampire.

789
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:30,694
- They don't have a name for what he is.

790
01:06:30,779 --> 01:06:32,613
You do know the rules, ma'am?

791
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:35,658
Yes, Lieutenant Boyle.
I've questioned him before.

792
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:40,162
Go ahead.

793
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:19,076
Good evening, Clarice.

794
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:23,247
I thought you might like
your drawings back, Doctor.

795
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:28,252
Just until you get your view.

796
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:31,088
How very thoughtful.

797
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:35,467
Or did Jack Crawford
send you for one last wheedle

798
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:37,720
before you're both booted off the case?

799
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,139
No, I came because I wanted to.

800
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:47,521
People will say we're in love.

801
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:51,150
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk,
tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

802
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:53,777
Anthrax Island.

803
01:07:54,446 --> 01:07:56,947
That was an especially nice touch,
Clarice.

804
01:07:57,532 --> 01:07:58,532
Yours?

805
01:07:59,284 --> 01:08:00,325
Yes.

806
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:01,910
Yeah.

807
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:04,079
That was good.

808
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:08,876
Pity about poor Catherine though.
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

809
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,336
Your anagrams are showing, Doctor.

810
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:14,882
Louis Friend?

811
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:18,135
Iron sulfide, also known as fool's gold.

812
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:22,473
Oh, Clarice, your problem is
you need to get more fun out of life.

813
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:25,309
You were telling me the truth
back in Baltimore, sir.

814
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,311
Please continue now.

815
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,189
I've read the case files. Have you?

816
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:34,109
Everything you need to find him
is right there in those pages.

817
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:37,237
-Then tell me how.
-First principles, Clarice.

818
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:39,072
Simplicity.

819
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:40,616
Read Marcus Aurelius.

820
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,869
Of each particular thing, ask,
what is it in itself?

821
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:45,704
What is its nature?

822
01:08:46,498 --> 01:08:50,542
What does he do, this man you seek?

823
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,295
He kills women.

824
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:56,423
No. That is incidental.

825
01:08:57,509 --> 01:08:59,259
What is the first
and principal thing he does?

826
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:02,554
What needs does he serve by killing?

827
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:04,056
Anger.

828
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:10,479
Um. . . social acceptance
and, um, sexual frustration, sir.

829
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:13,232
No. He covets.

830
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:16,235
That is his nature.

831
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:19,071
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?

832
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:21,865
Do we seek out things to covet?

833
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:25,077
Make an effort to answer now.

834
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:27,913
No. We just –

835
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:31,250
No. We begin by coveting
what we see every day.

836
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:34,670
Don't you feel eyes
moving over your body, Clarice?

837
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:38,799
And don't your eyes
seek out the things you want?

838
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,844
All right, yes. Now please tell me how.

839
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:43,220
No.

840
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:48,892
It is your turn to tell me, Clarice.
You don't have any more vacations to sell.

841
01:09:49,561 --> 01:09:51,645
Why did you leave that ranch?

842
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:55,899
Doctor, we don't have any more time
for any of this now.

843
01:09:56,568 --> 01:09:59,236
But we don't reckon time
the same way, do we, Clarice?

844
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,238
This is all the time you'll ever have.

845
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:03,699
Later. Now, please, listen to me.
We've only got five –

846
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:07,160
No! I will listen now.

847
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:12,541
After your father's murder, you were orphaned.
You were 10 years old.

848
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:15,711
You went to live with cousins
on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana.

849
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:17,379
And?

850
01:10:19,591 --> 01:10:21,842
And one morning, I just ran away.

851
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:26,013
Not "just," Clarice. What set you off?

852
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:27,931
You started at what time?

853
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,975
Early. Still dark.

854
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:32,895
Then something woke you, didn't it?
Was it a dream?

855
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:34,062
What was it?

856
01:10:35,607 --> 01:10:37,357
I heard a strange noise.

857
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:39,985
What was it?

858
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,653
It was. . .

859
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,323
screaming.

860
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:48,785
Some kind of screaming,
like a child's voice.

861
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,829
What did you do?

862
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:55,083
I went downstairs, outside.

863
01:10:57,712 --> 01:10:59,546
I crept up into the barn house.

864
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:03,342
I was so scared to look inside,
but I had to.

865
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,553
What did you see, Clarice?

866
01:11:06,638 --> 01:11:08,180
What did you see?

867
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:10,849
Lambs.

868
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,769
They were screaming.

869
01:11:14,354 --> 01:11:17,105
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?

870
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:18,941
And they were screaming.

871
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,569
And you ran away?

872
01:11:22,654 --> 01:11:23,654
No.

873
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:26,406
First I tried to free them. I –

874
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:29,618
I opened the gate to their pen,
but they wouldn't run.

875
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:32,871
They just stood there, confused.
They wouldn't run.

876
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:35,540
But you could, and you did, didn't you?

877
01:11:36,668 --> 01:11:37,918
Yes.

878
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:40,295
I took one lamb
and I ran away as fast as I could.

879
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:42,214
Where were you going, Clarice?

880
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:46,677
I don't know. I didn't have any food,
any water, and it was very cold.

881
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:47,970
It was very cold.

882
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,306
I thought –

883
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:54,559
I thought if I could save just one, but. . .

884
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:58,313
he was so heavy.

885
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:01,024
He was so heavy.

886
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:10,158
I didn't get more than a few miles
when the sheriff's car picked me up.

887
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:17,374
Rancher was so angry, he sent me to live
at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman.

888
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,252
I never saw the ranch again.

889
01:12:20,962 --> 01:12:24,047
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

890
01:12:26,009 --> 01:12:27,551
They killed him.

891
01:12:27,635 --> 01:12:29,845
You still wake up sometimes, don't you?

892
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:31,722
Wake up in the dark

893
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:35,350
and hear the screaming of the lambs.

894
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:36,935
Yes.

895
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:42,899
And you think if you saved poor Catherine,
you could make them stop, don't you?

896
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:45,277
You think, if Catherine lives,

897
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,696
you won't wake up in the dark ever again. . .

898
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:51,616
to that awful screaming of the lambs.

899
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:55,746
I don't know. I don't know.

900
01:12:57,832 --> 01:13:00,000
Thank you, Clarice.

901
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:02,085
Thank you.

902
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:03,837
Tell me his name, Doctor.

903
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:13,180
Dr. Chilton, I presume?

904
01:13:14,182 --> 01:13:15,766
I think you know each other.

905
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:19,227
Okay.

906
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:21,897
- We found her.
- Let's go.

907
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,899
It's your turn, Doctor.

908
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:26,568
-Out.
-Tell me his name.

909
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:29,362
Sorry, ma'am, I've got orders.
Have to put you on a plane.

910
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:30,947
Come on now.

911
01:13:31,032 --> 01:13:32,616
Brave Clarice.

912
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:36,912
You will let me know when those lambs
stop screaming, won't you?

913
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:38,997
Tell me his name, Doctor.

914
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:40,415
Clarice!

915
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:43,210
Your case file.

916
01:13:45,296 --> 01:13:46,296
Hey.

917
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:50,008
Good-bye, Clarice.

918
01:14:56,117 --> 01:14:57,909
Ready when you are, Doc.

919
01:14:57,994 --> 01:15:00,078
Just another minute, please.

920
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:11,882
Son of a bitch demanded a second dinner.

921
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:13,758
Lamb chops. Extra rare.

922
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:18,346
Wonder what he wants for breakfast.
Some damn thing from the zoo?

923
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:41,536
Good evening, gentlemen.

924
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:43,830
Okay, Doc. Grab some floor.

925
01:15:43,915 --> 01:15:45,999
-Same drill as before, please.
-Mm-hmm.

926
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:54,883
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

927
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:12,943
Okay.

928
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,701
- Hand me that, would you?
- Uh-huh.

929
01:16:26,874 --> 01:16:28,083
Thanks.

930
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:33,588
Mind the drawings, please.

931
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:38,218
Thank you.

932
01:17:02,702 --> 01:17:04,411
Jimmy, watch it! He's got me!

933
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:13,461
Jesus Christ!

934
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:26,016
I need help.

935
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,376
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

936
01:18:44,095 --> 01:18:46,262
What is this shit?

937
01:18:48,474 --> 01:18:50,266
Did somebody go up on five?

938
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:52,727
No. Nobody went up.

939
01:18:52,812 --> 01:18:55,647
- Call Pembry. Ask him to tell –

940
01:18:56,774 --> 01:18:59,192
CP. Shots fired on five.

941
01:18:59,276 --> 01:19:01,319
Repeat, shots fired on five.

942
01:19:01,404 --> 01:19:02,737
Sergeant Tate!

943
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:05,532
Shots fired on five.

944
01:19:05,616 --> 01:19:08,201
- Holy shit!
- What the hell?

945
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:10,578
--Shut up!

946
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:12,038
Bobby, get the vest.

947
01:19:12,123 --> 01:19:13,331
Right, Sarge.

948
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:16,376
- Brady, Howard, cover the –
- Look!

949
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:20,547
--It stopped.

950
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:23,591
Seal off a 10-block radius.

951
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:26,428
Get me the SWAT team
and an ambulance, double quick.

952
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:27,804
We're goin' up.

953
01:19:57,084 --> 01:19:59,085
Pembry!

954
01:20:00,087 --> 01:20:02,088
Boyle!

955
01:20:14,602 --> 01:20:15,852
Oh, God!

956
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:24,360
Go.

957
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,286
-Clear.
-Clear.

958
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:36,372
Command post, two officers down.

959
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:38,541
- Clear.
- Clear!

960
01:20:38,626 --> 01:20:40,210
Lecter's gone, Sarge.

961
01:20:40,294 --> 01:20:42,212
Prisoner is missing.

962
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:46,633
-Boyle's gun is gone, Sergeant.
-Repeat, Lecter's missing and armed.

963
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:48,885
He's stripped the bed.

964
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:51,304
Might be making a rope. Check all windows.

965
01:20:51,889 --> 01:20:54,349
Where the fuck is my ambulance?

966
01:20:54,433 --> 01:20:56,017
--He's alive.

967
01:20:56,936 --> 01:20:59,187
Sergeant Tate, he's alive!

968
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:02,190
Get ahold of him where
you can feel his hands, son. Talk to him.

969
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:04,317
What do I say?

970
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:06,903
It's Jim Pembry! Now talk to him, damn it!

971
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:10,573
Lecter's missing and armed.

972
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:13,117
Pembry. Pembry, can you hear me?

973
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:17,872
He took Boyle's gun. Pembry got off one round.
There's a chance Lecter was hit.

974
01:21:17,957 --> 01:21:20,250
Keep breathing in and out. That's it.

975
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:23,336
You're doing a good job.
Oh, you look real good there.

976
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:27,382
- Yeah, you look. . . real good.

977
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:45,525
-You ready?
-Let's go.

978
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:47,193
-Let's do it.
-Okay? Let's go.

979
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:54,242
-Got it?
-Yeah.

980
01:21:58,581 --> 01:22:00,582
Lookin' good, Pembry.
You're gonna make it.

981
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:03,084
You're doin' just fine.
You're doin' all right. That's right.

982
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:05,420
-Okay, I need that IV now!
-Lactated Ringer's.

983
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:08,006
Can we get the strap?
Buzz, where's the fuckin' oxygen?

984
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:11,175
Lookin' good, buddy. That's right.
Stay with me. Stay with me here.

985
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:15,388
We're losin' him. Downstairs, quickly!

986
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:17,849
- And up!

987
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:21,144
- Elevator! Out of the way!
- Clear the way!

988
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:22,979
Get out of the way.

989
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:28,276
--CP to Tate.

990
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,945
Uh, roger, Lieutenant. Tate here.

991
01:22:31,572 --> 01:22:33,698
I'm on the elevator bringin' Pembry down.

992
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,284
He seems to be hangin' on.

993
01:22:37,286 --> 01:22:38,870
Top three floors secured.

994
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:41,497
Main stairwell secured.

995
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,459
We think he's on two.

996
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:00,141
Tate? You still with me?

997
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:04,520
Uh, we're pretty sure
he's somewhere on two, sir.

998
01:23:04,605 --> 01:23:06,397
That's all for now. Over.

999
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:28,127
He's on the roof of the elevator.

1000
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:32,507
Okay, guys.

1001
01:23:49,316 --> 01:23:53,111
I see him. There's a gun by his hand.
He's not moving.

1002
01:23:53,904 --> 01:23:56,739
-One warning. We need him alive.
-Got it.

1003
01:23:57,825 --> 01:23:59,117
Lecter?

1004
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:00,910
Put your hands on your head.

1005
01:24:03,664 --> 01:24:04,914
One in the leg.

1006
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:17,427
No movement.

1007
01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:21,180
Johnny, hold your fire.
We're coming into the car.

1008
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:23,474
We're opening the hatch.

1009
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:25,643
Watch his hands.

1010
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,812
If there's any fire, it'll come from us.

1011
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:29,731
-Affirm?
-Got it.

1012
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:58,217
Memphis General, this is Medical Unit 26.

1013
01:24:58,302 --> 01:25:00,928
We're inbound
with a 50-year-old male police officer

1014
01:25:01,013 --> 01:25:02,764
with severe facial lacerations.

1015
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:06,517
Weapon unknown. We've got grand mal
seizure activity, but he's postictal now.

1016
01:25:06,602 --> 01:25:07,518
Copy.

1017
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:10,480
Uh, vital signs are good.
Pressure is 130 over 90.

1018
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:13,107
- Ninety?
-Yeah, that's right, 90. Pulse 84.

1019
01:25:13,192 --> 01:25:15,234
We've got him on
lactated Ringer's running,

1020
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:18,196
and, uh – and the, uh, patient
is on 10 liters of oxygen.

1021
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:20,782
Watch it!

1022
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:28,247
They found the ambulance
in a parking garage at Memphis Airport.

1023
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:29,540
Crew was dead.

1024
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:32,585
He killed a tourist too.

1025
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:34,670
Got his clothes, cash.

1026
01:25:34,755 --> 01:25:36,964
By now he could be anywhere.

1027
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:38,382
He won't come after me.

1028
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:39,967
-Oh, really?
-He won't.

1029
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:44,430
I can't explain it.
He – He would consider that rude.

1030
01:25:44,515 --> 01:25:47,475
It's over. She's dead.

1031
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:49,560
It's not your fault it worked out like this.

1032
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:53,564
Lecter said everything we need to catch him
with is right here in these pages.

1033
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:56,067
Dr. Lecter said a lot of things.

1034
01:25:56,735 --> 01:25:58,027
He's here, Ardelia.

1035
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:29,100
Is this Lecter's handwriting?

1036
01:26:31,562 --> 01:26:36,065
"Clarice, doesn't this random scattering
of sites seem desperately random?

1037
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:40,069
Like the elaboration of a bad liar.
Ta, Hannibal Lecter."

1038
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:42,780
"Desperately random." What does he mean?

1039
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:46,325
Not random at all maybe.
Like there's some pattern here.

1040
01:26:47,494 --> 01:26:50,538
Yeah, but there is no pattern,
or the computers would've nailed it.

1041
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:52,707
They were even found in random order.

1042
01:26:53,292 --> 01:26:55,334
Random because of the one girl.

1043
01:26:55,419 --> 01:26:56,919
The one he weighted down.

1044
01:26:57,421 --> 01:26:59,714
-Oh, Frederica Bimmel.
-Right.

1045
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:03,301
Yeah, from Belvedere, Ohio.

1046
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:07,138
First girl taken. Third body found. Why?

1047
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:09,348
Well, she didn't drift.
He weighted her down.

1048
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:12,852
What did Lecter say
about the first principles?

1049
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:14,312
Simplicity.

1050
01:27:14,855 --> 01:27:17,481
What does this guy do? He covets.

1051
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,818
How do we first start to covet?

1052
01:27:20,903 --> 01:27:22,695
We covet what we see –

1053
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:24,030
Every day.

1054
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:28,910
-Hot damn, Clarice.
-He knew her.

1055
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:47,238
-Mr. Bimmel?
-That's me.

1056
01:28:48,073 --> 01:28:50,741
Hello. I'm Clarice Starling.
I'm with the FBI.

1057
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:57,331
I sure appreciate you letting me
take a look around, Mr. Bimmel.

1058
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:00,668
I don't know nothin' new to tell ya.

1059
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:03,087
Police been back here
so many times already.

1060
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:08,009
Frederica went into Chicago
on the bus to see about a job.

1061
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:12,138
She left the interview okay.
She never come home.

1062
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:18,602
Her bedroom's how she left it. Upstairs.

1063
01:29:19,229 --> 01:29:20,521
Door to the left.

1064
01:32:05,896 --> 01:32:08,105
He's making himself
a woman suit, Mr. Crawford,

1065
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:09,440
out of real women!

1066
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:12,193
And he can sew, this guy.
He-He's very skilled.

1067
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:14,695
- He's a tailor or a dressmaker or –
- Starling –

1068
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:15,905
That's why they're all big.

1069
01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:18,574
He has to keep them alive
so he can starve them a while,

1070
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:19,950
so he can loosen their skin –

1071
01:32:20,035 --> 01:32:24,330
Starling, Starling, we know who he is and
where he is. We're on our way right now.

1072
01:32:24,414 --> 01:32:27,750
-Where?
-Calumet City, edge of Chicago.

1073
01:32:27,834 --> 01:32:31,128
-Be on the ground in 45 minutes with HRT.
-Oh, that's –

1074
01:32:31,213 --> 01:32:34,715
-That's great news, sir, but how –
-Johns Hopkins came up with some names.

1075
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:36,383
We fed 'em into known offenders.

1076
01:32:36,468 --> 01:32:40,554
Subject's name is Jame Gumb,
aka John Grant.

1077
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:43,349
Lecter's description was accurate.
He just lied about the name.

1078
01:32:43,433 --> 01:32:44,433
Listen to this.

1079
01:32:44,517 --> 01:32:46,810
Customs had some paper on him.

1080
01:32:46,895 --> 01:32:50,064
They stopped a carton
two years ago at LAX:

1081
01:32:50,148 --> 01:32:52,441
live caterpillars from Suriname.

1082
01:32:52,525 --> 01:32:55,486
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.

1083
01:32:56,071 --> 01:32:58,072
Well, Chicago's only 400 miles from here.

1084
01:32:58,156 --> 01:32:59,949
-I'll be there in –
- No, no, no, Starling.

1085
01:33:00,033 --> 01:33:03,452
There's not enough time.
We want him for murder, not kidnapping.

1086
01:33:03,536 --> 01:33:05,913
I need you to link him to the Bimmel girl
before he's indicted.

1087
01:33:05,997 --> 01:33:08,999
-See what you can dredge up in Belvedere.
-Yes, sir. You bet.

1088
01:33:09,084 --> 01:33:11,001
-I'll do my best.
-Starling.

1089
01:33:11,795 --> 01:33:15,506
We wouldn't have found him without you.
Nobody's gonna forget that.

1090
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:17,675
Least of all me.

1091
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:20,219
Thank you, sir.

1092
01:33:20,303 --> 01:33:22,304
- Thank you very much, Mr. Crawford.

1093
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:25,224
Mr. Crawford?

1094
01:33:37,654 --> 01:33:42,032
Thanks for the scraps, asshole.
I got a better idea.

1095
01:33:45,287 --> 01:33:46,495
Yeah.

1096
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:05,389
Okay, Precious, time for a little treat.

1097
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:20,362
Precious.

1098
01:34:37,547 --> 01:34:38,839
Come on, Precious.

1099
01:34:51,144 --> 01:34:52,311
Precious!

1100
01:34:53,063 --> 01:34:55,314
Are you out there, you little shit?

1101
01:34:56,399 --> 01:34:58,233
Come and get it, pretty girl.

1102
01:35:04,824 --> 01:35:07,117
Precious.

1103
01:35:07,202 --> 01:35:09,453
Please come. Come on.

1104
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:19,254
Come on, Precious.

1105
01:35:25,678 --> 01:35:27,679
Precious, come on.

1106
01:35:31,017 --> 01:35:32,601
Will you fuck me?

1107
01:35:32,685 --> 01:35:35,437
Come on. Take that bone. Come on.

1108
01:35:36,523 --> 01:35:39,483
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1109
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:41,151
I'd fuck me.

1110
01:35:41,903 --> 01:35:42,945
Come on.

1111
01:35:46,908 --> 01:35:48,742
I'd fuck me hard.

1112
01:35:49,369 --> 01:35:52,413
I'd fuck me so hard.

1113
01:35:56,042 --> 01:35:57,292
No!

1114
01:36:58,229 --> 01:37:00,314
Is that a good job, FBI agent?

1115
01:37:00,398 --> 01:37:04,568
You get to travel around and stuff?
I mean, better places than this?

1116
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:07,571
Sometimes you do.

1117
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:12,659
Freddie was so happy for me
when I got this job at the bank.

1118
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:17,372
Toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow
on the speakers all day.

1119
01:37:17,457 --> 01:37:19,541
She thought it was such hot shit.

1120
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:22,461
What did she know? Big dummy.

1121
01:37:22,962 --> 01:37:27,257
Stacy, did Frederica ever mention
a man named "Jamie" Gumb

1122
01:37:27,342 --> 01:37:28,967
or a Jame Gumb?

1123
01:37:29,719 --> 01:37:31,637
-How about John Grant?
-No.

1124
01:37:32,138 --> 01:37:34,556
Would she have had a friend
you didn't know about?

1125
01:37:34,641 --> 01:37:39,102
No way. If she had a guy, I'd have known.
Believe me. Sewing was her life.

1126
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:42,105
-Did you two ever work together or –
-Oh, sure.

1127
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:46,318
Me and Pam Malavesi used to help her
do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman.

1128
01:37:46,903 --> 01:37:49,738
Can you give me Mrs. Lippman's address?
I need to talk to her.

1129
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:21,728
So powerful. So beautiful.

1130
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:30,320
- Precious?

1131
01:38:34,409 --> 01:38:37,703
- Precious?
- Down here, you sack of shit!

1132
01:38:46,421 --> 01:38:47,921
-Put her in that bucket.
-No.

1133
01:38:48,006 --> 01:38:51,008
You get me a telephone
and lower it down here, now!

1134
01:38:54,053 --> 01:38:58,098
Oh, poodlie-poo, Precious.
Darling, are you all right?

1135
01:38:58,182 --> 01:39:01,310
She's in a lot of pain, mister.
She needs a vet.

1136
01:39:05,565 --> 01:39:08,275
She broke her leg on the way down.
I know it.

1137
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:10,527
-She's been licking it –
-Hey, don't you hurt my dog!

1138
01:39:10,612 --> 01:39:12,613
Don't you make me hurt your dog!

1139
01:39:12,697 --> 01:39:14,948
You don't know what pain is!

1140
01:39:20,288 --> 01:39:23,957
Get me a live telephone
and lower it down here, and do it now!

1141
01:39:28,421 --> 01:39:31,423
-You fucking – Oh, fuck!
-You better be getting me that telephone!

1142
01:39:32,842 --> 01:39:35,052
I'm gonna do it, mister!

1143
01:39:36,262 --> 01:39:38,263
I'll cut her neck off, I swear to God!

1144
01:39:39,849 --> 01:39:41,767
- All right, mister, I'm doing it!
- Motherfucking –

1145
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:53,028
- I'm in here! Here!

1146
01:40:05,249 --> 01:40:07,250
- Okay, I'm coming.

1147
01:40:08,961 --> 01:40:10,170
We're goin' in.

1148
01:40:15,218 --> 01:40:17,678
Good afternoon. Um, sorry to bother you.

1149
01:40:17,762 --> 01:40:19,930
I'm looking for Mrs. Lippman's family.

1150
01:40:20,682 --> 01:40:23,183
-FBI ! Everybody down!
-FBI ! Down, now!

1151
01:40:23,768 --> 01:40:25,477
The Lippmans don't live here anymore.

1152
01:40:25,978 --> 01:40:28,271
Excuse me, sir.
I really need to speak with you.

1153
01:40:29,565 --> 01:40:31,233
-Clear!
-Clear!

1154
01:40:31,943 --> 01:40:34,111
What's the problem, Officer?

1155
01:40:34,195 --> 01:40:36,988
Well, I'm investigating
the death of Frederica Bimmel.

1156
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:41,785
There's no one here, Jack.

1157
01:40:44,622 --> 01:40:45,831
Clarice.

1158
01:40:45,915 --> 01:40:47,290
Your name is?

1159
01:40:47,375 --> 01:40:49,918
-Oh, uh, Jack Gordon.
-Mr. Gordon. Good.

1160
01:40:50,002 --> 01:40:54,005
Um, well, Frederica used to work
for Mrs. Lippman. Did you know her?

1161
01:40:55,007 --> 01:40:56,508
No. Uh-uh.

1162
01:40:57,135 --> 01:41:01,179
Oh, wait. Was she a great big, fat person?

1163
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:03,932
Yeah, she was a big girl, sir.

1164
01:41:04,016 --> 01:41:07,561
Yeah, I – I may have see –
No, I read about her in the newspaper.

1165
01:41:08,229 --> 01:41:11,565
Um, Mrs. Lippman had a son though.

1166
01:41:11,649 --> 01:41:14,317
Maybe he could help you.
I got his card in here someplace.

1167
01:41:14,402 --> 01:41:16,403
-Do you wanna come in while I look for it?
-May I?

1168
01:41:16,487 --> 01:41:17,988
-Yeah, sure.
-Thank you.

1169
01:41:37,133 --> 01:41:39,301
Are you close
to catching somebody, you think?

1170
01:41:40,887 --> 01:41:42,971
Yes. We may be.

1171
01:41:45,308 --> 01:41:50,645
Did you. . . take over this place
after Mrs. Lippman died? Is that right?

1172
01:41:52,064 --> 01:41:56,693
Yeah. I bought this house,
uh, two years ago.

1173
01:41:57,945 --> 01:42:00,947
Did she leave any records?
Any business records?

1174
01:42:01,532 --> 01:42:04,743
Tax forms? Um, list of employees?

1175
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:07,370
No, nothing like that at all.

1176
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:12,334
Say, has the FBI learned something?

1177
01:42:13,336 --> 01:42:16,087
The police around here
don't seem to have the first clue.

1178
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:30,894
I mean, have you got like a description,
fingerprints, anything like that?

1179
01:42:32,271 --> 01:42:33,355
No.

1180
01:42:33,439 --> 01:42:34,523
Mm-hmm.

1181
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:37,108
No, we don't.

1182
01:42:46,994 --> 01:42:47,994
Ah.

1183
01:42:48,621 --> 01:42:49,830
Here's that number.

1184
01:42:51,582 --> 01:42:54,793
Very good, Mr. Gordon.
May I use your phone, please?

1185
01:43:02,218 --> 01:43:05,136
Sure, you can use my phone.

1186
01:43:06,931 --> 01:43:07,931
Freeze!

1187
01:43:09,058 --> 01:43:11,393
Put your hands over your head
and turn around!

1188
01:43:11,477 --> 01:43:12,686
Spread your legs!

1189
01:43:14,397 --> 01:43:15,605
Spread your legs!

1190
01:43:15,690 --> 01:43:17,482
Put your hands in the back, thumbs up –

1191
01:43:17,567 --> 01:43:19,109
Freeze!

1192
01:44:31,766 --> 01:44:33,016
Hey!

1193
01:44:53,663 --> 01:44:55,664
Hello? Are you there?

1194
01:44:57,416 --> 01:45:00,001
I'm down here! I'm down here!

1195
01:45:19,438 --> 01:45:20,939
Catherine Martin?

1196
01:45:21,607 --> 01:45:22,816
Yes!

1197
01:45:24,694 --> 01:45:27,195
FBI ! You're safe!

1198
01:45:27,697 --> 01:45:30,115
Safe? Shit. Get me outta here!

1199
01:45:45,715 --> 01:45:47,716
You're all right, Catherine.
Now where is he?

1200
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:50,885
How the fuck should I know?
Just get me outta here!

1201
01:45:50,970 --> 01:45:54,097
Catherine, you gotta be quiet.
Now shut that dog up!

1202
01:45:54,181 --> 01:45:56,391
Just get me outta here!

1203
01:45:56,976 --> 01:45:58,643
--Oh, God.

1204
01:46:01,063 --> 01:46:02,063
Catherine,

1205
01:46:02,648 --> 01:46:05,358
I'm gonna get you outta there,
but right now you listen to me.

1206
01:46:05,443 --> 01:46:07,610
I've gotta leave this room.
I'll be right back.

1207
01:46:08,237 --> 01:46:11,656
No, don't you leave me here,
you fuckin' bitch! No!

1208
01:46:11,741 --> 01:46:15,827
Don't you leave me here!
This guy's fuckin' crazy!

1209
01:46:18,622 --> 01:46:19,998
Please!

1210
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:23,585
I gotta get outta here!

1211
01:46:24,879 --> 01:46:26,004
Plea –

1212
01:46:26,088 --> 01:46:30,175
Catherine, the other officers
will be here any minute now!

1213
01:46:30,968 --> 01:46:32,886
Wait!

1214
01:46:32,970 --> 01:46:35,805
- Don't go! Wait!
- Shh! Quiet!

1215
01:46:36,891 --> 01:46:40,727
Come back.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1216
01:50:26,537 --> 01:50:27,829
--No.

1217
01:50:37,256 --> 01:50:39,841
-You okay?
-Gunpowder. It's nothing. I'm okay.

1218
01:50:39,925 --> 01:50:42,677
Agent Starling, how did you
track Buffalo Bill to this address?

1219
01:50:48,976 --> 01:50:51,269
Clarice M. Starling.

1220
01:50:53,897 --> 01:50:55,315
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1221
01:51:08,871 --> 01:51:11,080
Ernest W. Stevens.

1222
01:51:29,641 --> 01:51:32,935
- Special Agent Starling.
- Oh, Special Agent Mapp.

1223
01:51:33,020 --> 01:51:35,563
-Phone call.
-Oh, thank you. Excuse me, gentlemen.

1224
01:51:35,647 --> 01:51:36,647
Starling?

1225
01:51:39,651 --> 01:51:42,028
Pilch. Would you take our picture?

1226
01:51:42,112 --> 01:51:43,321
Sure.

1227
01:51:45,157 --> 01:51:47,158
Look, I just wanted to say
congratulations.

1228
01:51:48,327 --> 01:51:51,829
And I'm not much good at this kind of thing,
so I'm gonna duck outta here.

1229
01:51:52,414 --> 01:51:54,040
Okay. Sure. Um –

1230
01:51:55,250 --> 01:51:57,085
Thank you, Mr. Crawford.

1231
01:52:00,631 --> 01:52:01,547
Um –

1232
01:52:04,968 --> 01:52:07,136
Your father would've been proud today.

1233
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:11,808
Don't forget your phone call.

1234
01:52:16,855 --> 01:52:17,855
Starling.

1235
01:52:18,399 --> 01:52:20,024
Well, Clarice.

1236
01:52:20,609 --> 01:52:23,069
Have the lambs stopped screaming?

1237
01:52:23,153 --> 01:52:25,905
-Dr. Lecter.
- Don't bother with a trace.

1238
01:52:25,989 --> 01:52:27,865
I won't be on long enough.

1239
01:52:31,036 --> 01:52:32,787
Where are you, Dr. Lecter?

1240
01:52:33,622 --> 01:52:35,706
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice.

1241
01:52:35,791 --> 01:52:38,251
The world's more interesting
with you in it.

1242
01:52:38,836 --> 01:52:41,921
So you take care now
to extend me the same courtesy.

1243
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:44,006
You know I can't make that promise.

1244
01:52:44,591 --> 01:52:47,343
I do wish we could chat longer, but. . .

1245
01:52:48,679 --> 01:52:50,930
I'm having an old friend for dinner.

1246
01:52:52,641 --> 01:52:53,724
Bye.

1247
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:55,643
Dr. Lecter!

1248
01:52:58,272 --> 01:52:59,355
Dr. Lecter?

1249
01:53:02,067 --> 01:53:03,151
Dr. Lecter?

1250
01:53:05,529 --> 01:53:06,654
Dr. Lecter?

1251
01:53:07,531 --> 01:53:09,365
Very important –
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

1252
01:53:09,950 --> 01:53:12,535
-Is the security system all set up?
-Oh, yeah, the big-shot security.

1253
01:53:12,619 --> 01:53:14,162
Oh, thank you. I appreciate that.
