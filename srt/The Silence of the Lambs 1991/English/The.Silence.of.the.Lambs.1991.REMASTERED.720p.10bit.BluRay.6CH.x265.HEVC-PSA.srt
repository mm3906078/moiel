1
00:03:03,164 --> 00:03:04,665
Starling!

2
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:08,252
Starling.

3
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,882
Crawford wants to see you in his office.

4
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:15,593
Thank you, sir.

5
00:04:03,391 --> 00:04:04,892
- Clarice.
- Hey.

6
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:16,153
Hey, I got right to the end.

7
00:04:53,691 --> 00:04:55,752
So there shouldn't be any problem
if you could -

8
00:04:55,776 --> 00:04:57,337
- You looking for Crawford?
- Yes, sir.

9
00:04:57,361 --> 00:04:59,798
He should be back in a couple minutes.
Why don't you wait in his office.

10
00:04:59,822 --> 00:05:01,091
Okay.

11
00:05:01,115 --> 00:05:03,993
Then I think they were over into Flushing.

12
00:05:57,672 --> 00:06:01,068
Starling. Clarice M.

13
00:06:01,092 --> 00:06:03,403
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Crawford.

14
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:06,180
Sorry to pull you off the course
on such short notice.

15
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:09,910
Your instructors tell me you're doing well.
Top quarter of your class.

16
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:13,455
I hope so.
They haven't posted any grades yet.

17
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:16,291
A job's come up, and I thought about you.

18
00:06:16,315 --> 00:06:19,044
Not a job really.
More of an interesting errand.

19
00:06:19,068 --> 00:06:21,696
- Sit down.
- Yes, sir.

20
00:06:22,863 --> 00:06:26,969
- I remember you from my seminar at UVA.
- Yeah.

21
00:06:26,993 --> 00:06:29,137
You grilled me pretty hard, as I recall,

22
00:06:29,161 --> 00:06:31,848
on the Bureau's civil rights record
in the Hoover years.

23
00:06:31,872 --> 00:06:34,750
- I gave you an
- A-minus, sir.

24
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,356
Let's see.
Double major - psych and criminology.

25
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,675
Graduated magna. Summer internships
at the Reitzinger Clinic.

26
00:06:43,592 --> 00:06:45,362
It says here, when you graduate,

27
00:06:45,386 --> 00:06:47,930
you wanna come to work for me
in behavioral science.

28
00:06:48,514 --> 00:06:50,599
Yes. Very much, sir. Very much.

29
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:54,830
We're interviewing
all the serial killers now in custody

30
00:06:54,854 --> 00:06:56,707
for a psycho-behavioral profile.

31
00:06:56,731 --> 00:06:59,793
Could be a real help in unsolved cases.

32
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:02,403
Most of them have been happy to talk to us.

33
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:04,530
You spook easily, Starling?

34
00:07:05,114 --> 00:07:06,967
Not yet, sir.

35
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:09,886
See, the one we want most
refuses to cooperate.

36
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,413
I want you to go after him again today
in the asylum.

37
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,307
Who's the subject?

38
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:16,459
The psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter.

39
00:07:17,084 --> 00:07:18,919
“Hannibal the Cannibal.”

40
00:07:19,503 --> 00:07:21,630
I don't expect him to talk to you...

41
00:07:23,549 --> 00:07:25,986
but I have to be able to say we tried.

42
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,197
So, if he won't cooperate,
I want just straight reporting -

43
00:07:29,221 --> 00:07:31,241
how's he look, how's his cell look.

44
00:07:31,265 --> 00:07:34,894
Is he sketching, drawing?
If he is, what's he sketching?

45
00:07:38,647 --> 00:07:41,067
Here's a, uh, dossier on Lecter...

46
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:46,572
copy of our questionnaire,
and a special ID for you.

47
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:49,926
Have your memo on my desk
by 0800 Wednesday.

48
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,452
Okay.

49
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:56,767
Um, excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?

50
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,019
Lecter's been in prison
for so many years now.

51
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:02,272
Is there some connection
between him and Buffalo Bill maybe?

52
00:08:02,296 --> 00:08:04,191
I wish there were.

53
00:08:04,215 --> 00:08:06,050
I want your full attention, Starling.

54
00:08:07,093 --> 00:08:08,278
Yes, sir.

55
00:08:08,302 --> 00:08:10,679
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.

56
00:08:11,305 --> 00:08:15,309
Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over
all the physical procedures used with him.

57
00:08:16,018 --> 00:08:19,623
Do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever.

58
00:08:19,647 --> 00:08:21,690
And you're to tell him nothing personal,
Starling.

59
00:08:22,274 --> 00:08:24,985
Believe me, you don't want
Hannibal Lecter inside your head.

60
00:08:25,903 --> 00:08:28,715
Just do your job,
but never forget what he is.

61
00:08:28,739 --> 00:08:30,342
And what is that?

62
00:08:30,366 --> 00:08:32,886
Oh, he's a monster.

63
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,703
Pure psychopath.

64
00:08:35,287 --> 00:08:37,432
So rare to capture one alive.

65
00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:41,085
From a research point of view,
Lecter is our most prized asset.

66
00:08:42,837 --> 00:08:44,338
Well.

67
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:48,276
You know, we get a lot of detectives here,
but, I must say,

68
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,970
I can't ever remember one as attractive.

69
00:08:53,055 --> 00:08:55,867
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?

70
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:59,812
Because this can be quite a fun town
if you have the right guide.

71
00:09:00,437 --> 00:09:03,542
I'm sure this is a great town,
Dr. Chilton,

72
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:08,713
but, um, my instructions are to talk to Dr.
Lecter and report back this afternoon.

73
00:09:08,737 --> 00:09:12,509
I see. Well, let's make this quick then.

74
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:14,427
We've tried to study him, of course,

75
00:09:14,451 --> 00:09:17,389
but he's much too sophisticated
for the standard tests.

76
00:09:17,413 --> 00:09:19,808
And, oh, my, does he hate us.

77
00:09:19,832 --> 00:09:21,834
He thinks I'm his nemesis.

78
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,314
Crawford's very clever,
isn't he, using you?

79
00:09:26,338 --> 00:09:30,819
- What do you mean, sir?
- Pretty, young woman to turn him on.

80
00:09:30,843 --> 00:09:33,947
I don't believe Lecter's
even seen a woman in eight years.

81
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:37,391
And, oh, are you ever his taste,
so to speak.

82
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,121
I graduated from UVA, Doctor.
It is not a charm school.

83
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:43,772
Good. Then you should be able
to remember the rules.

84
00:09:47,318 --> 00:09:49,754
Do not touch the glass.
Do not approach the glass.

85
00:09:49,778 --> 00:09:53,258
You pass him nothing but soft paper.
No pencils or pens.

86
00:09:53,282 --> 00:09:55,385
No staples or paper clips in his paper.

87
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:57,929
Use the sliding food carrier.
No exceptions.

88
00:09:57,953 --> 00:10:00,348
If he attempts to pass you anything,
do not accept it.

89
00:10:00,372 --> 00:10:02,458
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, I understand, sir.

90
00:10:04,084 --> 00:10:07,522
I'm going to show you
why we insist on such precautions.

91
00:10:07,546 --> 00:10:10,275
On the afternoon of July 8, 1981,

92
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:13,361
he complained of chest pains
and was taken to the dispensary.

93
00:10:13,385 --> 00:10:15,947
His mouthpiece and restraints
were removed for an EKG.

94
00:10:15,971 --> 00:10:18,724
When the nurse leaned over him,
he did this to her.

95
00:10:21,518 --> 00:10:26,249
The doctors managed to reset her jaw,
more or less, save one of her eyes.

96
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:29,252
His pulse never got above 85,

97
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:31,278
even when he ate her tongue.

98
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:34,490
- I keep him in here.
- Dr. Chilton.

99
00:10:36,116 --> 00:10:40,472
Um, if Lecter feels that you're his enemy,

100
00:10:40,496 --> 00:10:44,267
then, um, well, maybe we'll have more luck
if I go in by myself.

101
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,293
What do you think?

102
00:10:48,837 --> 00:10:52,549
You might have suggested this
in my office and saved me the time.

103
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:58,013
Yes, sir, but then I - I would have missed
the pleasure of your company, sir.

104
00:11:01,058 --> 00:11:03,269
When she's finished, bring her out.

105
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,984
Hi. I'm Barney.

106
00:11:34,008 --> 00:11:36,444
He told you don't get near the glass?

107
00:11:36,468 --> 00:11:39,614
- Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.
- Mm-hmm.

108
00:11:39,638 --> 00:11:42,826
Nice to meet you, Clarice.
You can hang your coat up here if you like.

109
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,768
Oh, thank you. I will.

110
00:11:47,229 --> 00:11:49,874
He's past the others - the last cell.

111
00:11:49,898 --> 00:11:51,608
You keep to the right.

112
00:11:54,153 --> 00:11:57,573
- I put out a chair for you.
- Oh, yes. That's very good. Thank you.

113
00:11:59,408 --> 00:12:02,411
<i>I'll be watching. You'll do fine.</i>

114
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:15,341
Hi.

115
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:35,069
I can smell your cunt!

116
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,645
- Good morning.
- Dr. Lecter, my name is Clarice Starling.

117
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:54,171
May I speak with you?

118
00:12:54,963 --> 00:12:57,359
You're one of Jack Crawford's, aren't you?

119
00:12:57,383 --> 00:12:58,967
I am, yes.

120
00:13:00,052 --> 00:13:02,012
May I see your credentials?

121
00:13:02,721 --> 00:13:04,223
Certainly.

122
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:12,481
Closer, please.

123
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:16,110
Closer.

124
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:36,422
That expires in one week.
You're not real FBI, are you?

125
00:13:37,005 --> 00:13:39,383
I'm still in training at the academy.

126
00:13:40,592 --> 00:13:43,530
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?

127
00:13:43,554 --> 00:13:47,307
Yes. I'm a student.
I'm here to learn from you.

128
00:13:47,975 --> 00:13:51,204
Maybe you can decide for yourself whether
or not I'm qualified enough to do that.

129
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:52,729
Mmm.

130
00:13:54,523 --> 00:13:57,693
That is rather slippery of you,
Agent Starling.

131
00:14:01,196 --> 00:14:02,906
Sit. Please.

132
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:14,352
Now then, tell me,
what did Miggs say to you?

133
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:16,795
Multiple Miggs in the next cell.

134
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:20,424
He hissed at you. What did he say?

135
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,821
He said, “I can smell your cunt.”

136
00:14:24,845 --> 00:14:26,346
I see.

137
00:14:27,723 --> 00:14:29,725
I myself cannot.

138
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:40,903
You use Evyan skin cream.

139
00:14:43,655 --> 00:14:46,325
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps.

140
00:14:48,243 --> 00:14:49,995
But not today.

141
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:53,933
Did you do all these drawings, Doctor?

142
00:14:53,957 --> 00:14:55,459
Ah.

143
00:14:56,585 --> 00:14:59,880
That is the Duomo seen from the Belvedere.

144
00:15:01,548 --> 00:15:03,342
Do you know Florence?

145
00:15:04,301 --> 00:15:06,362
All that detail just from memory, sir?

146
00:15:06,386 --> 00:15:10,575
Memory, Agent Starling,
is what I have instead of a view.

147
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:16,539
Well, perhaps you'd care to lend us
your view on this questionnaire, sir.

148
00:15:16,563 --> 00:15:19,417
Oh, no, no, no, no.

149
00:15:19,441 --> 00:15:21,252
You were doing fine.

150
00:15:21,276 --> 00:15:24,464
You had been courteous
and receptive to courtesy.

151
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:28,968
You had established trust
with the... embarrassing truth about Miggs.

152
00:15:28,992 --> 00:15:32,955
And now this... ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire.

153
00:15:34,873 --> 00:15:36,434
It won't do.

154
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,853
I'm only asking you to
look at this, Doctor.

155
00:15:38,877 --> 00:15:40,813
Either you will or you won't.

156
00:15:40,837 --> 00:15:44,734
Yeah. Jack Crawford
must be very busy indeed

157
00:15:44,758 --> 00:15:47,403
if he is recruiting help
from the student body.

158
00:15:47,427 --> 00:15:50,490
Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill.

159
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:52,951
What a naughty boy he is.

160
00:15:52,975 --> 00:15:56,704
Do you know why he's called “Buffalo Bill”?

161
00:15:56,728 --> 00:16:00,107
Please tell me. The newspapers won't say.

162
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:03,920
Well, it started as a bad joke
in Kansas City Homicide.

163
00:16:03,944 --> 00:16:08,031
They said, “This one likes
to skin his humps.”

164
00:16:09,283 --> 00:16:13,179
Why do you think he removes their skins,

165
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:14,973
Agent Starling?

166
00:16:14,997 --> 00:16:17,124
Thrill me with your acumen.

167
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,727
It excites him.

168
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:22,754
Most serial killers keep some sort
of trophies from their victims.

169
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:25,733
- I didn't.
- No.

170
00:16:25,757 --> 00:16:27,551
No, you ate yours.

171
00:16:30,304 --> 00:16:32,389
You send that through now.

172
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:57,205
Hmm.

173
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:00,560
Oh, Agent Starling.

174
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:03,795
You think you can dissect me
with this blunt little tool?

175
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:07,567
No. I - I thought that your knowledge -

176
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:09,986
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

177
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,032
You know what you look like to me
with your good bag and your cheap shoes?

178
00:17:14,056 --> 00:17:15,557
You look like a rube -

179
00:17:16,224 --> 00:17:20,354
a well-scrubbed, hustling rube
with a little taste.

180
00:17:21,146 --> 00:17:23,583
Good nutrition's given you
some length of bone,

181
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:26,919
but you're not more than one generation
from poor white trash,

182
00:17:26,943 --> 00:17:29,005
are you, Agent Starling?

183
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:34,135
And that accent you've tried so desperately
to shed - pure West Virginia.

184
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:36,721
What does your father do?
Is he a coal miner?

185
00:17:36,745 --> 00:17:38,348
Does he stink of the lamp?

186
00:17:38,372 --> 00:17:41,309
And, oh, how quickly the boys found you -

187
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,979
all those tedious, sticky fumblings
in the back seats of cars

188
00:17:45,003 --> 00:17:48,608
while you could only dream
of getting out, getting anywhere,

189
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:52,177
getting all the way to the FBI.

190
00:17:55,806 --> 00:17:57,474
You see a lot, Doctor.

191
00:17:58,642 --> 00:18:01,037
But are you strong enough to point

192
00:18:01,061 --> 00:18:03,605
that high-powered perception at yourself?

193
00:18:04,815 --> 00:18:07,377
What about it? Why don't you -
Why don't you look at yourself

194
00:18:07,401 --> 00:18:09,736
and write down what you see?

195
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:12,489
Or maybe you're afraid to.

196
00:18:22,165 --> 00:18:25,228
A census taker once tried to test me.

197
00:18:25,252 --> 00:18:28,648
I ate his liver with some fava beans

198
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:30,841
and a nice Chianti.

199
00:18:39,766 --> 00:18:41,977
You fly back to school
now, little Starling.

200
00:18:43,103 --> 00:18:44,604
Fly, fly, fly-

201
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,667
Fly, fly, fly-

202
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:49,401
Fly, fly, fly-

203
00:18:59,661 --> 00:19:02,890
I bit my wrist so I could die.

204
00:19:02,914 --> 00:19:06,477
Look at the blood!

205
00:19:06,501 --> 00:19:09,063
Gotcha!

206
00:19:09,087 --> 00:19:11,256
Miggs! You stupid fuck!

207
00:19:14,092 --> 00:19:15,653
I'm gonna kill him!

208
00:19:15,677 --> 00:19:19,699
Agent Starling! Come back!
Agent Starling! Agent Starling!

209
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:23,119
I would not have had that happen to you.
Discourtesy is unspeakably ugly to me.

210
00:19:23,143 --> 00:19:25,788
- Then do this test for me.
- No. But I will make you happy.

211
00:19:25,812 --> 00:19:27,749
I'll give you a chance
for what you love most.

212
00:19:27,773 --> 00:19:30,501
- And what is that, Doc -
- Advancement, of course. Listen carefully.

213
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:33,421
Look deep within yourself,
Clarice Starling.

214
00:19:33,445 --> 00:19:37,300
Go seek out Miss Mofet,
an old patient of mine - M-O-F-E-T.

215
00:19:37,324 --> 00:19:41,220
Go. I don't think Miggs could manage again
quite so soon, even though he is crazy.

216
00:19:41,244 --> 00:19:44,331
Go now!

217
00:20:24,371 --> 00:20:26,998
Hi, Bill.

218
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:31,062
- Hey!
- Daddy!

219
00:20:31,086 --> 00:20:32,170
Hey, Clarice.

220
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:35,674
Hello, my girl.

221
00:20:36,508 --> 00:20:40,238
- Did you get any bad guys today, Daddy?
- No, angel. They all got away today.

222
00:20:40,262 --> 00:20:41,763
Aw, shoot.

223
00:21:01,908 --> 00:21:03,469
FBI! Hands up!

224
00:21:03,493 --> 00:21:05,680
- Don't move!
- Turn around.

225
00:21:05,704 --> 00:21:07,914
Hands behind your back. Thumbs up.

226
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:13,145
You're dead, Starling.

227
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:15,314
Johnson, good job.

228
00:21:15,338 --> 00:21:17,149
Good entry. Good commands.

229
00:21:17,173 --> 00:21:19,193
- Starling, where's your danger area?
- In the corner, sir.

230
00:21:19,217 --> 00:21:20,653
- Did you check the corner?
- No, sir.

231
00:21:20,677 --> 00:21:21,946
That's the reason you're dead.

232
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,115
3-109.

233
00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:27,785
3-109. Breaking doors or windows

234
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:29,996
to enter or exit.

235
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,105
Uh, Rule 4-048.

236
00:21:50,498 --> 00:21:53,102
Clarice. Phone. It's the guru.

237
00:21:53,126 --> 00:21:54,186
- Crawford?
- Yeah.

238
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,271
Thanks, Ardelia.

239
00:21:55,295 --> 00:21:58,107
- Starling?
- Sir.

240
00:21:58,131 --> 00:21:59,799
Miggs is dead.

241
00:22:00,842 --> 00:22:02,653
Dead?

242
00:22:02,677 --> 00:22:04,572
How?

243
00:22:04,596 --> 00:22:07,909
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him
all afternoon and Miggs crying.

244
00:22:07,933 --> 00:22:10,560
They found him at bed check.
He'd swallowed his own tongue.

245
00:22:13,647 --> 00:22:14,749
Starling?

246
00:22:14,773 --> 00:22:17,209
Yeah. I'm - I'm still here, sir.

247
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:20,195
I just -
I don't know how to feel about this.

248
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:24,199
You don't have to feel any way about it.
Lecter did it to amuse himself.

249
00:22:25,325 --> 00:22:27,511
<i>Look, I know it got ugly today, but -</i>

250
00:22:27,535 --> 00:22:31,307
He mentioned a name at the end - a Mofet.

251
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:33,142
Any follow-up on her?

252
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:37,396
Uh, well, Lecter altered or destroyed most
of his patients' histories prior to capture,

253
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,398
so there's no record of anyone named Mofet.

254
00:22:39,422 --> 00:22:45,363
But, um, I thought the “yourself” reference
was, uh, too hokey for Lecter.

255
00:22:45,387 --> 00:22:48,199
So I figured, he's from Baltimore,

256
00:22:48,223 --> 00:22:53,037
and I looked in the phone book,
and there's a Your Self Storage facility

257
00:22:53,061 --> 00:22:55,605
<i>right outside of downtown Baltimore, sir.</i>

258
00:22:57,774 --> 00:23:01,879
Unit 31 was leased for 10 years,

259
00:23:01,903 --> 00:23:03,714
prepaid in full.

260
00:23:03,738 --> 00:23:05,925
The contract was in the name

261
00:23:05,949 --> 00:23:09,035
of a... Miss Hester Mofet.

262
00:23:09,995 --> 00:23:12,682
So nobody's been in here since 1980?

263
00:23:12,706 --> 00:23:15,017
Not to my knowledge.

264
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:18,938
Privacy is a great concern
to my customers.

265
00:23:18,962 --> 00:23:21,816
Yes. I won't disturb anything. I promise.

266
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,151
I'll be outta here before you know it.

267
00:23:24,175 --> 00:23:25,528
Can I help you?

268
00:23:25,552 --> 00:23:28,680
Yes, actually. I can't -

269
00:23:32,851 --> 00:23:33,852
It's stuck.

270
00:23:34,602 --> 00:23:36,747
You could return tomorrow with my son.

271
00:23:36,771 --> 00:23:40,292
What about him?

272
00:23:40,316 --> 00:23:42,586
I would ask my driver to help you,

273
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,946
but he detests physical labor.

274
00:23:45,905 --> 00:23:47,717
Right.

275
00:23:47,741 --> 00:23:50,535
Well, you just stay here.
I'll be back in one minute.

276
00:24:21,941 --> 00:24:24,211
Stuck.

277
00:24:24,235 --> 00:24:26,613
Hand me that flashlight, sir.

278
00:24:37,082 --> 00:24:38,809
Oh.

279
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:42,271
Um, if this door should fall down or -

280
00:24:42,295 --> 00:24:44,356
anything else,

281
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,259
uh, this is the number
for our Baltimore field office.

282
00:24:48,843 --> 00:24:52,823
Now, they know that you're with me.
You call them if anything should happen.

283
00:24:52,847 --> 00:24:54,349
Yes, Miss Starling.

284
00:24:58,311 --> 00:24:59,729
<i>"QM</i>

285
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:28,270
Clarice, I cleared the way for you.

286
00:27:28,294 --> 00:27:30,814
- Watch yourself.
- Okay. Thanks.

287
00:27:30,838 --> 00:27:34,300
“Hester Mofet."
It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor?

288
00:27:35,385 --> 00:27:38,346
“Hester Mofet.” “The rest of me.”

289
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:42,892
“Miss the Rest of Me.”
Meaning that you rented that garage?

290
00:28:18,344 --> 00:28:20,656
Thank you.

291
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,098
Your bleeding has stopped.

292
00:28:24,517 --> 00:28:26,144
How did you -

293
00:28:27,687 --> 00:28:29,581
It's nothing.

294
00:28:29,605 --> 00:28:31,858
It's just a scratch.

295
00:28:32,608 --> 00:28:34,920
Dr. Lecter, whose head is in that bottle?

296
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:38,257
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?

297
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:40,175
Why, do you know something about him?

298
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:44,179
I might if I saw the case file.
You could get that for me.

299
00:28:44,203 --> 00:28:47,582
Why don't we talk about Miss Mofet?
You wanted me to find him.

300
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:51,669
His real name is Benjamin Raspail.

301
00:28:52,503 --> 00:28:56,108
A former patient of mine
whose romantic attachments ran

302
00:28:56,132 --> 00:28:58,843
to, shall we say, the exotic.

303
00:28:59,552 --> 00:29:01,113
I did not kill him, I assure you.

304
00:29:01,137 --> 00:29:03,699
Merely tucked him away
very much as I found him

305
00:29:03,723 --> 00:29:06,285
after he'd missed three appointments.

306
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:09,580
But... if you didn't kill him,
then who did, sir?

307
00:29:09,604 --> 00:29:13,000
Who can say? Best thing for him really.

308
00:29:13,024 --> 00:29:15,502
His therapy was going nowhere.

309
00:29:15,526 --> 00:29:19,381
His dress, uh, makeup -

310
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:21,175
Raspail was a transvestite?

311
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:23,719
In life? Oh, no.

312
00:29:23,743 --> 00:29:26,096
Garden-variety manic-depressive.

313
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,955
Tedious. Very tedious.

314
00:29:28,831 --> 00:29:31,268
No, no. Just think of him
as a kind of experiment,

315
00:29:31,292 --> 00:29:35,022
a fledgling killer's
first effort at transformation.

316
00:29:35,046 --> 00:29:37,465
How did you feel when you saw him,
Clarice?

317
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:42,678
Scared at first, then... exhilarated.

318
00:29:43,262 --> 00:29:45,532
Jack Crawford is helping your career,
isn't he?

319
00:29:45,556 --> 00:29:48,393
Apparently he likes you,
and you like him too.

320
00:29:49,143 --> 00:29:51,121
I never thought about it.

321
00:29:51,145 --> 00:29:54,249
Do you think Jack Crawford
wants you sexually?

322
00:29:54,273 --> 00:29:55,876
True, he is much older,

323
00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:00,780
but do you think he visualizes scenarios,
exchanges, fucking you?

324
00:30:03,658 --> 00:30:05,427
That doesn't interest me, Doctor.

325
00:30:05,451 --> 00:30:08,955
And frankly, it's - it's the sort of thing
that Miggs would say.

326
00:30:10,873 --> 00:30:12,750
Not anymore.

327
00:30:20,091 --> 00:30:21,759
Thank you, Barney.

328
00:30:25,638 --> 00:30:27,640
What happened to your drawings?

329
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,954
Punishment, you see. For Miggs.

330
00:30:31,978 --> 00:30:33,747
Just like that gospel program.

331
00:30:33,771 --> 00:30:36,875
When you leave,
they'll turn the volume way up.

332
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:40,278
Dr. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.

333
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:43,322
What did you mean by “transformation,”
Doctor?

334
00:30:52,498 --> 00:30:55,084
I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice...

335
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:59,422
and I know they will never, ever
let me out while I'm alive.

336
00:31:00,381 --> 00:31:02,651
What I want is a view.

337
00:31:02,675 --> 00:31:06,655
I want a window
where I can see a tree or even water.

338
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:10,492
I want to be in a federal institution
far away from Dr. Chilton.

339
00:31:10,516 --> 00:31:13,078
What did you mean by “fledgling killer”?

340
00:31:13,102 --> 00:31:15,038
Are you saying that he's killed again?

341
00:31:15,062 --> 00:31:18,542
I'm offering you
a psychological profile on Buffalo Bill

342
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:20,818
based on the case evidence.

343
00:31:26,073 --> 00:31:28,451
I'll help you catch him, Clarice.

344
00:31:35,249 --> 00:31:37,376
You know who he is, don't you?

345
00:31:38,294 --> 00:31:41,148
Tell me who decapitated
your patient, Doctor.

346
00:31:41,172 --> 00:31:44,067
All good things to those who wait.

347
00:31:44,091 --> 00:31:45,694
I've waited, Clarice.

348
00:31:45,718 --> 00:31:48,554
But how long can you
and Ol' Jackie boy wait?

349
00:31:49,138 --> 00:31:54,352
Our little Billy must already
be searching for that next special lady.

350
00:32:57,456 --> 00:32:59,083
Hey, little cheeper.

351
00:33:07,842 --> 00:33:10,052
<i>I'll</i> be right there.

352
00:33:17,768 --> 00:33:19,854
Goddamn.

353
00:33:29,155 --> 00:33:30,197
Fuckin' - Geez.

354
00:33:36,245 --> 00:33:38,497
Can I help you with that?

355
00:33:39,165 --> 00:33:41,000
- Would you?
- Sure.

356
00:33:42,251 --> 00:33:43,937
- Thank you.
- That's all right.

357
00:33:43,961 --> 00:33:46,297
- You look kinda handicapped.
- Yeah.

358
00:33:46,964 --> 00:33:49,318
I got it this far.
I just can't get it up in the truck.

359
00:33:49,342 --> 00:33:51,403
I could use all the help I can get.
Just grab that.

360
00:33:51,427 --> 00:33:52,904
- Up

361
00:33:52,928 --> 00:33:55,324
Yeah. Just set it down. That's good.

362
00:33:55,348 --> 00:33:58,851
Uh, get in the truck,
and I wanna push it all the way up.

363
00:33:59,977 --> 00:34:02,497
- I really appreciate this. Thank you.
- All right. Yeah.

364
00:34:02,521 --> 00:34:05,524
Thank you. Now - Push it all the way back.

365
00:34:07,026 --> 00:34:08,962
Okay. Is this good?

366
00:34:08,986 --> 00:34:12,215
- Yeah, that's good. That's great.
- Ah -

367
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,176
- That's great.
- Okay.

368
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,871
- Hey, say, are you about a size 14?
- Sorry?

369
00:34:40,101 --> 00:34:41,602
Good.

370
00:34:59,578 --> 00:35:01,080
Oh, good.

371
00:35:02,373 --> 00:35:03,874
Good.

372
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:20,975
Hold!

373
00:35:31,736 --> 00:35:33,946
Starling!

374
00:35:36,782 --> 00:35:39,636
Outside. Let's go.

375
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,496
Cindy! In the ring for Starling! Let's go!

376
00:35:51,088 --> 00:35:52,733
- FBI! Hold it!
- Hold it right there!

377
00:35:52,757 --> 00:35:55,777
Saddle up. Pack your field gear. You're
movin' out. You're goin' with Crawford.

378
00:35:55,801 --> 00:35:57,946
- Where?
- They found a girl's body down in West Virginia.

379
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:00,890
Been in the water about a week.
Looks like a Buffalo Bill-type situation.

380
00:36:12,943 --> 00:36:16,047
Keeps 'em alive for three days.
We don't know why.

381
00:36:16,071 --> 00:36:19,301
There's no evidence of rape
or physical abuse prior to death.

382
00:36:19,325 --> 00:36:21,994
All the mutilation you see there
is postmortem.

383
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,806
Okay. Three days.

384
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:28,226
Then he shoots them, skins them,
and dumps them -

385
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,353
each body in a different river.

386
00:36:30,377 --> 00:36:33,523
The water leaves us
no trace evidence of any kind.

387
00:36:33,547 --> 00:36:36,109
That's Frederica Bimmel, the first one.

388
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:39,237
Her body was the only one
he took the trouble to weight down,

389
00:36:39,261 --> 00:36:42,115
so actually she was the third girl found.

390
00:36:42,139 --> 00:36:44,141
After her, he got lazy.

391
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,146
Okay. Let's see.

392
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:51,666
Circles where the girls were abducted.

393
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:53,627
Arrows where their bodies were found.

394
00:36:53,651 --> 00:36:57,297
This new one today washed up here.

395
00:36:57,321 --> 00:36:58,823
Elk River, West Virginia.

396
00:37:18,425 --> 00:37:20,427
Look at 'em, Starling.
Tell me what you see.

397
00:37:22,388 --> 00:37:24,074
Well, he's a white male.

398
00:37:24,098 --> 00:37:26,910
Uh, serial killers tend to hunt
within their own ethnic groups.

399
00:37:26,934 --> 00:37:28,912
Um, he's not a drifter.

400
00:37:28,936 --> 00:37:32,189
He's got his own... house somewhere,
not an apartment.

401
00:37:32,815 --> 00:37:36,211
- Why?
- What he does with them takes privacy.

402
00:37:36,235 --> 00:37:38,255
He's in his 30s or 40s.

403
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:43,552
He's got real physical strength,
combined with an older man's self-control.

404
00:37:43,576 --> 00:37:45,786
He's-He's cautious, precise.

405
00:37:46,954 --> 00:37:49,540
And he's never impulsive.
<i>He'll</i> never stop.

406
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:51,959
Why not?

407
00:37:53,043 --> 00:37:56,547
He's got a real taste for it now,
and he's getting better at his work.

408
00:37:58,215 --> 00:38:01,051
Not bad, Starling. Questions?

409
00:38:01,677 --> 00:38:06,616
Yes, sir. Um, you haven't mentioned anything
about the information contained in my report

410
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,702
or Dr. Lecter's offer, sir.

411
00:38:08,726 --> 00:38:10,704
I'm considering it.

412
00:38:10,728 --> 00:38:12,980
That's why you sent me in there, isn't it?

413
00:38:14,064 --> 00:38:16,025
To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?

414
00:38:18,861 --> 00:38:21,488
Well, if that was the case, then I just -

415
00:38:22,448 --> 00:38:24,843
I just wish I was in on it, that's all.

416
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:27,387
If I'd sent you in there
with an actual agenda,

417
00:38:27,411 --> 00:38:29,389
Lecter would have known it instantly.

418
00:38:29,413 --> 00:38:32,166
He would have toyed with you,
then turned to stone.

419
00:39:06,408 --> 00:39:09,846
Excuse me, Sheriff Perkins.
These are the FBI people.

420
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:12,682
Sheriff Perkins. Jack Crawford, FBI.

421
00:39:12,706 --> 00:39:15,000
Special Agent Terry, Agent Starling.

422
00:39:15,751 --> 00:39:17,938
We appreciate being invited
to your jurisdiction.

423
00:39:17,962 --> 00:39:20,923
I didn't call you. That was somebody
from the state attorney's office.

424
00:39:21,548 --> 00:39:23,652
We'll extend you every courtesy,
but right now I -

425
00:39:23,676 --> 00:39:25,779
Sheriff.

426
00:39:25,803 --> 00:39:27,989
This type of sex crime has certain aspects

427
00:39:28,013 --> 00:39:30,575
I'd just as soon discuss in private.

428
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:32,309
Know what I mean?

429
00:41:21,543 --> 00:41:23,730
[{dooropens]
- Oscar.

430
00:41:23,754 --> 00:41:25,690
- Fetch Dr. Akin from the chapel.
- Yes, sir.

431
00:41:25,714 --> 00:41:27,609
Starling, we're back here.

432
00:41:27,633 --> 00:41:30,320
Tell Lamar to come on
when he's finished playing his music.

433
00:41:30,344 --> 00:41:33,472
Yeah, we'll be sending in a minute.

434
00:41:35,015 --> 00:41:37,827
I need a - I need a six-way link-up.

435
00:41:37,851 --> 00:41:40,521
Chicago, Detroit - What? What?

436
00:41:45,275 --> 00:41:47,128
Uh, excuse me.

437
00:41:47,152 --> 00:41:48,880
Excuse me, gentlemen.

438
00:41:48,904 --> 00:41:52,759
You officers and gentlemen, listen here
now. There's things we need to do for her.

439
00:41:52,783 --> 00:41:54,636
I know that you all brought her this far

440
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,679
and that her folks would thank you
if they could

441
00:41:56,703 --> 00:42:00,183
for your - for your kindness
and your sensitivity.

442
00:42:00,207 --> 00:42:02,367
But now, please, go on now
and let us take care of her.

443
00:42:03,919 --> 00:42:05,337
Go on now.

444
00:42:08,715 --> 00:42:10,926
Thank you.

445
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,597
Thank you.

446
00:42:16,723 --> 00:42:18,350
Okay, good.

447
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,087
Yeah, that's right.
West Vir - Yeah. Elk River.

448
00:42:29,111 --> 00:42:31,071
Stand by for transmission.

449
00:42:35,075 --> 00:42:36,368
Ray.

450
00:42:48,755 --> 00:42:51,216
Doctor, Lamar, let's take a look at her.

451
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,736
Jesus.

452
00:43:16,992 --> 00:43:18,160
Okay, Starling.

453
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,541
Bill.

454
00:43:40,974 --> 00:43:43,244
Star-shaped contact entrance wound

455
00:43:43,268 --> 00:43:45,437
over the, uh, sternum.

456
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:49,667
Um, muzzle stamp at the top.

457
00:43:49,691 --> 00:43:51,944
- Wrongful death.
- Wrongful death.

458
00:43:53,403 --> 00:43:56,257
She'll have to go
to the state pathologist at Claxton.

459
00:43:56,281 --> 00:44:00,118
Well, I-I'd better get back to
that service. Lamar'll help ya.

460
00:44:00,994 --> 00:44:04,248
Lord Almighty.

461
00:44:06,917 --> 00:44:09,002
What else do you see, Starling?

462
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:12,631
Well, she's not local.

463
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,385
Her ears are pierced three times,
and there's, uh -

464
00:44:17,386 --> 00:44:20,681
Uh, glitter nail polish.
It looks like town to me.

465
00:44:26,645 --> 00:44:29,731
Two of her fingernails are broken off,
and there's, uh -

466
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,002
there's dirt or grit under them.

467
00:44:33,026 --> 00:44:35,404
It looks like she's tried to claw her way
through something.

468
00:44:36,571 --> 00:44:39,342
Ray, get pictures of her teeth.
<i>We'll</i> fax them to Missing Persons.

469
00:44:39,366 --> 00:44:40,867
Right.

470
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:51,712
Let's do another.

471
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:02,472
She's got something in her throat.

472
00:45:03,932 --> 00:45:05,868
When a body comes out of the water,

473
00:45:05,892 --> 00:45:08,812
lots of times there's, like,
leaves and things in the mouth.

474
00:45:40,177 --> 00:45:43,221
What is that, some kind of seed pod?

475
00:45:43,889 --> 00:45:46,266
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.

476
00:45:47,059 --> 00:45:49,829
But there's no way that could get
way down in there like that.

477
00:45:49,853 --> 00:45:52,272
Not unless somebody shoved it in there.

478
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,086
She'll be easier to print
when we turn her over.

479
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:00,405
- Lamar, will you give me a hand with this?
- Yes, sir, I will.

480
00:46:04,618 --> 00:46:06,203
Ooh, Jack.

481
00:46:07,204 --> 00:46:08,681
- What do you make of these?
- Hmm.

482
00:46:08,705 --> 00:46:11,792
Different configuration than the
other victims. Get close-ups.

483
00:46:11,917 --> 00:46:13,811
The victim's skin removed at this time

484
00:46:13,835 --> 00:46:17,023
in two large diamond-shaped sections
above the buttocks.

485
00:46:17,047 --> 00:46:20,360
Stellate exit wound level with the second
or the third thoracic vertebrae,

486
00:46:20,384 --> 00:46:23,529
<i>approximately six inches
from the right shoulder blade.</i>

487
00:46:23,553 --> 00:46:24,971
Starling.

488
00:46:26,014 --> 00:46:29,535
When - When I told that sheriff
we shouldn't talk in front of a woman,

489
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:31,621
that really burned you, didn't it?

490
00:46:31,645 --> 00:46:34,439
It was just smoke, Starling.
I had to get rid of him.

491
00:46:35,315 --> 00:46:39,670
It matters, Mr. Crawford.
Cops look at you to see how to act.

492
00:46:39,694 --> 00:46:42,197
- It matters.
- Point taken.

493
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,848
Ligature marks found around the wrists,

494
00:46:50,872 --> 00:46:52,892
<i>not around the ankles.</i>

495
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:55,669
<i>This would indicate that the skinning
was postmortem.</i>

496
00:47:19,401 --> 00:47:22,713
- Time, Pilch. My move.
- No fair. You lured him with produce.

497
00:47:22,737 --> 00:47:25,115
Tough noogies. Still my turn.

498
00:47:26,408 --> 00:47:28,177
Nice and slow, baby.

499
00:47:28,201 --> 00:47:30,912
If the beetle moves one of your men,
does that still count?

500
00:47:33,373 --> 00:47:35,667
Of course it counts. How do you play?

501
00:47:36,793 --> 00:47:37,794
Agent Starling?

502
00:47:39,546 --> 00:47:41,590
Where the heck did this come from?

503
00:47:42,215 --> 00:47:43,776
It's practically mush.

504
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,070
It was found behind the soft palate
of a murder victim.

505
00:47:46,094 --> 00:47:48,322
The body was in the Elk River
in West Virginia.

506
00:47:48,346 --> 00:47:51,576
- It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?
- I'm afraid I can't tell you any more about that.

507
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,994
We heard about it on the radio.

508
00:47:53,018 --> 00:47:55,371
You mean this is, like,
a clue from a real murder case?

509
00:47:55,395 --> 00:47:58,398
- Cool!
- Just ignore him. He's not a PhD.

510
00:47:59,024 --> 00:48:02,295
<i>A Sphingid ceratomia maybe.</i>

511
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,404
Boy, he's a big sucker.

512
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,159
Okay. Let's check morphology.

513
00:48:13,497 --> 00:48:16,791
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

514
00:48:17,918 --> 00:48:20,337
What do you do when you're not detecting,
Agent Starling?

515
00:48:21,546 --> 00:48:24,591
Try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.

516
00:48:25,217 --> 00:48:27,093
You ever go out
for cheeseburgers and beer?

517
00:48:28,803 --> 00:48:30,823
The amusing house wine?

518
00:48:30,847 --> 00:48:32,807
Are you hitting on me, Doctor?

519
00:48:33,642 --> 00:48:35,578
- Yes.
- Gotcha.

520
00:48:35,602 --> 00:48:37,938
- What do you got, Roden?
- Agent Starling.

521
00:48:38,647 --> 00:48:41,709
<i>Meet Mr. Acherontia styx.</i>

522
00:48:41,733 --> 00:48:43,211
Weird.

523
00:48:43,235 --> 00:48:46,339
Better known to his friends
as the death's-head moth.

524
00:48:46,363 --> 00:48:49,342
- And where does it come from?
- That's what's strange.

525
00:48:49,366 --> 00:48:51,093
- They only live in Asia.
- Asia?

526
00:48:51,117 --> 00:48:53,971
In this country, they'd have to be
specially raised from imported eggs.

527
00:48:53,995 --> 00:48:57,308
Uh, somebody grew this guy.
Fed him honey and nightshade.

528
00:48:57,332 --> 00:48:58,833
Kept him warm.

529
00:48:59,918 --> 00:49:01,419
Somebody loved him.

530
00:49:15,642 --> 00:49:17,143
Please.

531
00:49:27,445 --> 00:49:28,947
Hello?

532
00:49:36,121 --> 00:49:38,808
Where are you?

533
00:49:38,832 --> 00:49:41,167
Let me out of here!

534
00:49:47,465 --> 00:49:49,819
Hey!

535
00:49:49,843 --> 00:49:52,804
Please help me!

536
00:49:54,681 --> 00:49:57,159
Someone help me! Please!

537
00:49:57,183 --> 00:49:59,853
Why won't you answer me? Please!

538
00:50:02,647 --> 00:50:06,168
<i>- Good morning. I'm Donna Ferucci.
- I'm Gene Cassel with sports.</i>

539
00:50:06,192 --> 00:50:09,380
<i>And I'm Tim Langhorn.
Our top story for this morning.</i>

540
00:50:09,404 --> 00:50:13,759
<i>Catherine Martin, the 25-year-old
daughter of Senator Ruth Martin,</i>

541
00:50:13,783 --> 00:50:15,386
<i>listed first as a missing person,</i>

542
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:20,099
<i>is now believed to have been kidnapped by the
serial killer known only as Buffalo Bill.</i>

543
00:50:20,123 --> 00:50:22,727
<i>Memphis police sources indicate
that the missing girl's blouse -</i>

544
00:50:22,751 --> 00:50:24,979
<i>- Thank</i> you.
<i>- Has been identified - sliced up the back -</i>

545
00:50:25,003 --> 00:50:28,566
<i>in what has become a kind of grim,
all-too-familiar calling card.</i>

546
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:31,277
<i>Young Catherine Martin, as we've said,
is the only daughter</i>

547
00:50:31,301 --> 00:50:34,864
<i>of US Senator Ruth Martin, the Republican
junior senator from Tennessee.</i>

548
00:50:34,888 --> 00:50:38,618
<i>And while her kidnapping is not at this point
considered to be politically motivated,</i>

549
00:50:38,642 --> 00:50:41,871
<i>nevertheless, it has stirred the government
to its highest levels.</i>

550
00:50:41,895 --> 00:50:44,707
<i>Reached for comment on the ski slopes
of Stowe, Vermont,</i>

551
00:50:44,731 --> 00:50:48,753
<i>the president himself said to be,
and I quote, “intensely concerned.”</i>

552
00:50:48,777 --> 00:50:50,880
<i>- Just moments ago, Senator Martin -
- Excuse me.</i>

553
00:50:50,904 --> 00:50:52,947
<i>Taped this dramatic personal plea.</i>

554
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:56,868
<i>I'm speaking now
to the person who's holdin' ' my daughter.</i>

555
00:50:58,578 --> 00:51:01,289
<i>Catherine is very gentle and kind.</i>

556
00:51:02,457 --> 00:51:04,292
<i>Talk to her and you'll see.</i>

557
00:51:05,919 --> 00:51:07,813
<i>You have the power.</i>

558
00:51:07,837 --> 00:51:09,839
<i>You are in charge.</i>

559
00:51:12,467 --> 00:51:15,720
<i>I know you can feel love and compassion.</i>

560
00:51:17,222 --> 00:51:21,243
<i>You have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world</i>

561
00:51:21,267 --> 00:51:23,978
<i>that you can be merciful as well as strong,</i>

562
00:51:24,729 --> 00:51:27,124
<i>that you're big enough to treat Catherine</i>

563
00:51:27,148 --> 00:51:29,567
<i>better than the world has treated you.</i>

564
00:51:30,276 --> 00:51:31,945
<i>You have that power.</i>

565
00:51:32,529 --> 00:51:34,632
<i>Please.</i>

566
00:51:34,656 --> 00:51:36,759
<i>My daughter is Catherine.</i>

567
00:51:36,783 --> 00:51:39,053
<i>- Boy, that's smart.
- Release her unharmed.</i>

568
00:51:39,077 --> 00:51:42,973
- Jesus, that's really smart.
- She keeps repeating the name.

569
00:51:42,997 --> 00:51:46,268
If he sees Catherine as a person
and not just an object,

570
00:51:46,292 --> 00:51:47,978
it's harder to tear her up.

571
00:51:48,002 --> 00:51:50,296
<i>Please, release my little girl.</i>

572
00:51:51,673 --> 00:51:54,610
What you're doing, Miss Starling,
is coming into my hospital

573
00:51:54,634 --> 00:51:59,281
to conduct an interview and refusing to share
information with me for the third time.

574
00:51:59,305 --> 00:52:03,828
Sir, I told you this is just a routine
follow-up on the Raspail case.

575
00:52:03,852 --> 00:52:07,456
- He is my patient. I have rights.
- I understand that, sir.

576
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:11,985
Look, I am not just some turnkey,
Miss Starling.

577
00:52:13,027 --> 00:52:15,464
This is the number
for the US Attorney's office.

578
00:52:15,488 --> 00:52:19,009
Please, either you discuss this with him
or you let me do my job.

579
00:52:19,033 --> 00:52:21,035
Do you understand?

580
00:52:25,331 --> 00:52:28,561
<i>If your profile helps us catch Buffalo Bill</i>

581
00:52:28,585 --> 00:52:30,879
in time to save Catherine Martin...

582
00:52:31,963 --> 00:52:34,483
the senator promises you a transfer

583
00:52:34,507 --> 00:52:38,779
to the VA hospital at Oneida Park, New
York, with a view of the woods nearby.

584
00:52:38,803 --> 00:52:41,657
Maximum security still applies, of course.

585
00:52:41,681 --> 00:52:44,309
You'd have reasonable access to books.

586
00:52:45,435 --> 00:52:47,580
Best of all though,

587
00:52:47,604 --> 00:52:49,498
one week of the year,

588
00:52:49,522 --> 00:52:51,483
you get to leave the hospital

589
00:52:52,066 --> 00:52:53,693
and go here.

590
00:52:56,863 --> 00:52:58,364
Plum Island.

591
00:52:59,741 --> 00:53:03,012
Every day of that week,
you may walk on the beach,

592
00:53:03,036 --> 00:53:05,723
you may swim in the ocean -
for up to one hour -

593
00:53:05,747 --> 00:53:09,268
under SWAT team surveillance, of course.

594
00:53:09,292 --> 00:53:11,544
And there you have it.

595
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:17,842
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.

596
00:53:19,469 --> 00:53:21,989
Copy of the senator's offer.

597
00:53:22,013 --> 00:53:25,350
This offer is non-negotiable and final.

598
00:53:26,142 --> 00:53:27,811
Catherine Martin dies, you get nothing.

599
00:53:38,947 --> 00:53:42,116
“Plum Island
Animal Disease Research Center.”

600
00:53:45,245 --> 00:53:46,830
Sounds charming.

601
00:53:47,622 --> 00:53:51,393
That's only part of the island.
There's a very - very nice beach.

602
00:53:51,417 --> 00:53:53,771
Terns nest there. There's beautiful -

603
00:53:53,795 --> 00:53:56,047
Terns? Mm.

604
00:53:57,006 --> 00:54:00,236
If I help you, Clarice,
it will be “turns” with us too.

605
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:03,489
Quid pro quo.
I tell you things, you tell me things.

606
00:54:03,513 --> 00:54:06,325
Not about this case though.
About yourself.

607
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:09,435
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?

608
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:15,483
Yes or no, Clarice?
Poor little Catherine is waiting.

609
00:54:16,693 --> 00:54:18,069
Go, Doctor.

610
00:54:19,279 --> 00:54:21,865
What is your worst memory of childhood?

611
00:54:23,825 --> 00:54:25,910
Death of my father.

612
00:54:26,494 --> 00:54:29,455
Tell me about it. And
don't lie, or <i>I'll</i> know.

613
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,542
He was the town marshal, and...

614
00:54:33,877 --> 00:54:35,461
one night he

615
00:54:36,212 --> 00:54:39,507
surprised two burglars coming out
of the back of a drugstore.

616
00:54:40,967 --> 00:54:42,903
They shot him.

617
00:54:42,927 --> 00:54:45,322
Was he killed outright?

618
00:54:45,346 --> 00:54:49,392
No. He was very strong.
He lasted more than a month.

619
00:54:50,643 --> 00:54:53,688
My mother died when I was very young, so -

620
00:54:54,856 --> 00:54:57,293
My father had become the whole world to me,

621
00:54:57,317 --> 00:54:59,837
and, uh, when he left me, I had nothing.

622
00:54:59,861 --> 00:55:01,487
I was 10 years old.

623
00:55:02,822 --> 00:55:04,657
You're very frank, Clarice.

624
00:55:05,742 --> 00:55:09,829
I think it would be quite something
to know you in private life.

625
00:55:12,415 --> 00:55:14,208
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

626
00:55:15,376 --> 00:55:19,797
So tell me about Miss West Virginia.
Was she a large girl?

627
00:55:22,592 --> 00:55:24,945
- Yes.
- Big through the hips?

628
00:55:24,969 --> 00:55:27,513
- Roomy?
- They all were.

629
00:55:28,264 --> 00:55:29,658
What else?

630
00:55:29,682 --> 00:55:33,495
She had an object deliberately inserted
into her throat.

631
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:38,250
Now, that hasn't been made public yet.
We don't know what it means.

632
00:55:38,274 --> 00:55:39,984
Was it a butterfly?

633
00:55:41,361 --> 00:55:43,446
Yes. A moth.

634
00:55:44,656 --> 00:55:48,868
Just like the one we found
in Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.

635
00:55:50,286 --> 00:55:52,163
Why does he place them there, Doctor?

636
00:55:53,373 --> 00:55:56,501
The significance of the moth is change.

637
00:55:57,418 --> 00:56:00,004
Caterpillar into chrysalis or pupa...

638
00:56:01,005 --> 00:56:03,007
and, from thence, into beauty.

639
00:56:04,008 --> 00:56:06,386
Our Billy wants to change too.

640
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,908
There's no correlation in the literature
between transsexualism and violence.

641
00:56:10,932 --> 00:56:13,810
- Transsexuals are very passive.
- Clever girl.

642
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,831
You're so close to the way you're
gonna catch him. Do you realize that?

643
00:56:17,855 --> 00:56:19,941
No. Tell me why.

644
00:56:20,775 --> 00:56:22,878
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.

645
00:56:22,902 --> 00:56:24,487
What happened next?

646
00:56:28,408 --> 00:56:32,638
I don't imagine the answer is
on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.

647
00:56:32,662 --> 00:56:36,850
I went to live with my mother's cousin
and her husband in Montana.

648
00:56:36,874 --> 00:56:38,227
They had a ranch.

649
00:56:38,251 --> 00:56:40,229
Was it a cattle ranch?

650
00:56:40,253 --> 00:56:42,356
Sheep and horses.

651
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:44,090
How long did you live there?

652
00:56:45,133 --> 00:56:46,276
Two months.

653
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,844
Why so briefly?

654
00:56:48,428 --> 00:56:49,512
I ran away.

655
00:56:50,096 --> 00:56:51,615
Why, Clarice?

656
00:56:51,639 --> 00:56:54,118
Did the rancher make you perform fellatio?

657
00:56:54,142 --> 00:56:56,060
Did he sodomize you?

658
00:56:56,728 --> 00:56:59,939
No. He was a very decent man.

659
00:57:01,607 --> 00:57:03,609
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

660
00:57:05,486 --> 00:57:08,007
Billy is not a real transsexual.

661
00:57:08,031 --> 00:57:10,175
But he thinks he is. He tries to be.

662
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:13,303
He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.

663
00:57:13,327 --> 00:57:15,848
You said I was very close
to the way we would catch him.

664
00:57:15,872 --> 00:57:17,558
What did you mean, Doctor?

665
00:57:17,582 --> 00:57:20,060
There are three major centers
for transsexual surgery -

666
00:57:20,084 --> 00:57:24,565
Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota,
and Columbus Medical Center.

667
00:57:24,589 --> 00:57:27,860
I wouldn't be surprised
if Billy had applied for sex reassignment

668
00:57:27,884 --> 00:57:29,611
at one or all of them

669
00:57:29,635 --> 00:57:31,947
and been rejected.

670
00:57:31,971 --> 00:57:33,890
On what basis would they reject him?

671
00:57:35,016 --> 00:57:37,494
<i>Look for severe childhood disturbances</i>

672
00:57:37,518 --> 00:57:39,663
<i>associated with violence.</i>

673
00:57:39,687 --> 00:57:42,708
<i>Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice.</i>

674
00:57:42,732 --> 00:57:46,962
<i>He was made one
through years of systematic abuse.</i>

675
00:57:46,986 --> 00:57:50,591
<i>Billy hates his own identity, you see,</i>

676
00:57:50,615 --> 00:57:53,427
<i>and he thinks that makes him a transsexual.</i>

677
00:57:53,451 --> 00:57:57,431
<i>But his pathology
is a thousand times more savage</i>

678
00:57:57,455 --> 00:57:59,457
<i>and more terrifying.</i>

679
00:58:02,877 --> 00:58:06,565
It rubs lotion on its skin.
It does this whenever it's told.

680
00:58:06,589 --> 00:58:09,568
Mister, my family will pay cash.

681
00:58:09,592 --> 00:58:12,845
Whatever ransom you're askin' for,
they'll pay it.

682
00:58:13,721 --> 00:58:18,226
It rubs the lotion on its skin,
or else it gets the hose again.

683
00:58:19,977 --> 00:58:22,623
Yes, it will, Precious.
It will get the hose.

684
00:58:22,647 --> 00:58:25,942
Okay. Okay. Okay.

685
00:58:27,485 --> 00:58:29,338
Okay. Okay.

686
00:58:29,362 --> 00:58:30,863
Okay.

687
00:58:32,156 --> 00:58:36,095
Mister, if you let me go, I won't -
I won't press charges.

688
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:38,263
I promise.

689
00:58:38,287 --> 00:58:41,058
See, my mom is a real important woman.

690
00:58:41,082 --> 00:58:43,268
I guess you already know that.

691
00:58:43,292 --> 00:58:45,920
Now it places the lotion in the basket.

692
00:58:46,712 --> 00:58:50,800
Please! Please! I want to go home.

693
00:58:51,759 --> 00:58:53,987
I want to go home, please!

694
00:58:54,011 --> 00:58:55,155
Please.

695
00:58:55,179 --> 00:58:57,348
It places the lotion in the basket.

696
00:58:58,307 --> 00:59:02,353
I want to see my mommy! Please -

697
00:59:03,146 --> 00:59:06,333
I want to see my - I want -

698
00:59:06,357 --> 00:59:09,610
I want - I want to see -

699
00:59:10,444 --> 00:59:14,073
Put the fucking lotion in the basket!

700
00:59:48,566 --> 00:59:51,712
You still think you're gonna walk
on some beach and see the birdies?

701
00:59:51,736 --> 00:59:54,155
No, I don't think so.

702
00:59:55,698 --> 00:59:58,177
I called Senator Ruth Martin.

703
00:59:58,201 --> 01:00:00,870
She never heard of any deal with you.

704
01:00:01,704 --> 01:00:03,831
They scammed you, Hannibal.

705
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:06,959
Stand outside.

706
01:00:08,711 --> 01:00:09,921
And shut the door.

707
01:00:10,588 --> 01:00:12,173
- Barney.
- Mm-hmm.

708
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:22,451
There never was a deal
with Senator Martin, but there is now.

709
01:00:22,475 --> 01:00:23,744
I designed it.

710
01:00:23,768 --> 01:00:27,230
Of course, I worked in a few conditions
for my own benefit as well.

711
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:33,253
Identify Buffalo Bill by name,
and if the girl is found in time,

712
01:00:33,277 --> 01:00:34,963
Senator Martin will have you transferred

713
01:00:34,987 --> 01:00:37,198
to Brushy Mountain State Prison
in Tennessee.

714
01:00:38,699 --> 01:00:40,201
Answer me, Hannibal.

715
01:00:42,578 --> 01:00:46,749
You answer me now, or by God,
you'll never leave this cell.

716
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:51,045
Who is Buffalo Bill?

717
01:00:52,338 --> 01:00:54,006
His first name is Louis.

718
01:00:54,924 --> 01:00:58,487
I'll tell the rest to the senator herself,
but only in Tennessee.

719
01:00:58,511 --> 01:01:00,763
And I have a few conditions of my own.

720
01:01:03,683 --> 01:01:05,559
Clean him up and get him ready to go.

721
01:01:06,769 --> 01:01:10,123
<i>Jack, Hannibal Lecter's
being transferred to Memphis.</i>

722
01:01:10,147 --> 01:01:11,792
Transferred?

723
01:01:11,816 --> 01:01:16,296
Did you have a trainee make some sort of
phony offer to Lecter in the senator's name?

724
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,340
Yeah. I rolled the dice. I had to.

725
01:01:18,364 --> 01:01:22,761
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.
Paul Krendler's over here from Justice.

726
01:01:22,785 --> 01:01:25,037
She's asking him to take over in Memphis.

727
01:01:50,438 --> 01:01:52,165
Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter.

728
01:01:52,189 --> 01:01:55,043
I'm Lieutenant Boyle.
This is Sergeant Patrick.

729
01:01:55,067 --> 01:01:57,379
Now, we're gonna treat you
as good as you treat us.

730
01:01:57,403 --> 01:02:00,072
You be a gentleman,
you're gonna get three hots and a cot.

731
01:02:01,615 --> 01:02:04,994
Sir, if you'll sign right here,
<i>we'll</i> have us a legal transfer.

732
01:02:08,164 --> 01:02:09,290
Where is it?

733
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:12,335
Here, sir. Use mine.

734
01:02:59,757 --> 01:03:03,719
Senator Martin, Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

735
01:03:08,974 --> 01:03:10,184
Dr. Lecter.

736
01:03:10,976 --> 01:03:13,979
I brought an affidavit
guaranteeing your new rights.

737
01:03:14,605 --> 01:03:16,732
You'll want to read it before I sign.

738
01:03:20,903 --> 01:03:24,740
I won't waste your time or Catherine's time
bargaining for petty privileges.

739
01:03:25,324 --> 01:03:27,386
Clarice Starling
and that awful Jack Crawford

740
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:29,203
have wasted far too much time already.

741
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:32,248
I only pray
they haven't doomed the poor girl.

742
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:37,145
Let me help you now,
and I will trust you when it is all over.

743
01:03:37,169 --> 01:03:39,004
You have my word. Paul?

744
01:03:42,258 --> 01:03:44,802
Buffalo Bill's real name is Louis Friend.

745
01:03:45,845 --> 01:03:47,239
I met him just once.

746
01:03:47,263 --> 01:03:52,393
He was referred to me in April or May 1980
by my patient Benjamin Raspail.

747
01:03:53,185 --> 01:03:54,687
They were lovers, you see.

748
01:03:55,479 --> 01:03:59,066
But Raspail had become very frightened.

749
01:03:59,608 --> 01:04:02,820
Apparently, Louis had murdered a transient

750
01:04:03,404 --> 01:04:06,449
and done things with the skin.

751
01:04:07,658 --> 01:04:10,244
We need his address
and a physical description.

752
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:12,997
Tell me, Senator,

753
01:04:13,873 --> 01:04:16,351
did you nurse Catherine yourself?

754
01:04:16,375 --> 01:04:18,961
- What?
- Did you breast-feed her?

755
01:04:19,462 --> 01:04:21,982
- Wait a minute.
- Yes, I did.

756
01:04:22,006 --> 01:04:25,509
- Toughened your nipples, didn't it?
- You son of a bitch!

757
01:04:26,093 --> 01:04:29,906
Amputate a man's leg,
and he can still feel it tickling.

758
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:35,060
Tell me, Mom, when your little girl
is on the slab, where will it tickle you?

759
01:04:35,769 --> 01:04:38,856
Take this thing back to Baltimore.

760
01:04:40,232 --> 01:04:43,378
Five-foot-ten, strongly built,
about 180 pounds.

761
01:04:43,402 --> 01:04:47,591
Hair blond, eyes pale blue.
He'd be about 35 now.

762
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:50,075
He said he lived in Philadelphia
but may have lied.

763
01:04:50,659 --> 01:04:52,679
That's all I can remember, Mom.

764
01:04:52,703 --> 01:04:55,414
But if I think of any more,
I will let you know.

765
01:04:57,917 --> 01:05:00,294
Oh, and, Senator, just one more thing.

766
01:05:02,713 --> 01:05:04,215
Love your suit.

767
01:05:06,425 --> 01:05:08,695
I can tell you now
that in a meeting earlier this evening

768
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:13,158
with Senator Ruth Martin, Dr. Lecter
agreed to assist in the investigation

769
01:05:13,182 --> 01:05:16,328
of trying to find the abductor
of Catherine Martin, Buffalo Bill.

770
01:05:16,352 --> 01:05:18,580
- How do you fit in, sir?
- It's through my unique insight

771
01:05:18,604 --> 01:05:20,707
into Lecter's mind
that this breakthrough was possible.

772
01:05:20,731 --> 01:05:22,000
And Buffalo Bill's real name?

773
01:05:22,024 --> 01:05:25,962
Buffalo Bill's real name is now a matter
of record with the proper authorities.

774
01:05:25,986 --> 01:05:28,632
- Can you give us more information?
- My name is Dr. Frederick Chilton.

775
01:05:28,656 --> 01:05:30,199
- How do you spell that?
- That's C-H -

776
01:05:31,784 --> 01:05:33,285
Are you with Dr. Chilton's group?

777
01:05:34,036 --> 01:05:36,038
Uh, well, I just saw him outside, sir.

778
01:05:36,705 --> 01:05:40,268
Access to Lecter is strictly limited.
We've been getting death threats.

779
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:41,835
I understand, sir.

780
01:05:47,967 --> 01:05:49,593
Log in and check your weapon.

781
01:05:51,011 --> 01:05:53,406
I can't take all the credit for myself.

782
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:55,200
Senator Martin, the Justice Department,

783
01:05:55,224 --> 01:05:58,245
people at the FBI,
the folks at the Baltimore State Hospital.

784
01:05:58,269 --> 01:06:00,813
And now for the hard part,
apprehending the suspect.

785
01:06:01,814 --> 01:06:04,275
Excuse me, folks. I have to catch a flight.

786
01:06:08,279 --> 01:06:09,905
Command desk. Officer Jacobs.

787
01:06:19,206 --> 01:06:21,917
- Is it true what they're saying?
- Huh?

788
01:06:23,294 --> 01:06:25,462
He's some kind of vampire.

789
01:06:27,715 --> 01:06:30,860
They don't have a name for what he is.

790
01:06:30,884 --> 01:06:32,720
You do know the rules, ma'am?

791
01:06:33,387 --> 01:06:35,764
Yes, Lieutenant Boyle.
I've questioned him before.

792
01:06:39,184 --> 01:06:40,269
Go ahead.

793
01:07:17,514 --> 01:07:19,183
Good evening, Clarice.

794
01:07:21,143 --> 01:07:23,354
I thought you might like
your drawings back, Doctor.

795
01:07:26,565 --> 01:07:28,359
Just until you get your view.

796
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,195
How very thoughtful.

797
01:07:32,696 --> 01:07:35,634
Or did Jack Crawford
send you for one last wheedle

798
01:07:35,658 --> 01:07:37,826
before you're both booted off the case?

799
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:40,245
No, I came because I wanted to.

800
01:07:45,209 --> 01:07:47,628
People will say we're in love.

801
01:07:48,629 --> 01:07:51,256
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk,
tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

802
01:07:51,757 --> 01:07:53,884
Anthrax Island.

803
01:07:54,551 --> 01:07:57,054
That was an especially nice touch,
Clarice.

804
01:07:57,638 --> 01:07:58,639
Yours?

805
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:00,492
Yes.

806
01:08:00,516 --> 01:08:02,017
Yeah.

807
01:08:02,685 --> 01:08:04,186
That was good.

808
01:08:04,895 --> 01:08:09,042
Pity about poor Catherine though.
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

809
01:08:09,066 --> 01:08:11,443
Your anagrams are showing, Doctor.

810
01:08:12,861 --> 01:08:15,048
Louis Friend?

811
01:08:15,072 --> 01:08:18,301
Iron sulfide, also known as fool's gold.

812
01:08:18,325 --> 01:08:22,579
Oh, Clarice, your problem is
you need to get more fun out of life.

813
01:08:23,163 --> 01:08:25,416
You were telling me the truth
back in Baltimore, sir.

814
01:08:26,166 --> 01:08:27,418
Please continue now.

815
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:30,295
I've read the case files. Have you?

816
01:08:31,213 --> 01:08:34,275
Everything you need to find him
is right there in those pages.

817
01:08:34,299 --> 01:08:37,404
- Then tell me how.
- First principles, Clarice.

818
01:08:37,428 --> 01:08:39,239
Simplicity.

819
01:08:39,263 --> 01:08:40,782
Read Marcus Aurelius.

820
01:08:40,806 --> 01:08:43,976
Of each particular thing, ask,
what is it in itself?

821
01:08:44,518 --> 01:08:45,811
What is its nature?

822
01:08:46,603 --> 01:08:50,649
What does he do, this man you seek?

823
01:08:52,067 --> 01:08:53,461
He kills women.

824
01:08:53,485 --> 01:08:56,530
No. That is incidental.

825
01:08:57,614 --> 01:08:59,426
What is the first
and principal thing he does?

826
01:08:59,450 --> 01:09:02,721
What needs does he serve by killing?

827
01:09:02,745 --> 01:09:04,222
Anger.

828
01:09:04,246 --> 01:09:10,645
Um... social acceptance
and, um, sexual frustration, sir.

829
01:09:10,669 --> 01:09:13,338
No. He covets.

830
01:09:14,757 --> 01:09:16,341
That is his nature.

831
01:09:16,925 --> 01:09:19,178
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?

832
01:09:19,887 --> 01:09:21,972
Do we seek out things to covet?

833
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:25,243
Make an effort to answer now.

834
01:09:25,267 --> 01:09:28,079
No. We just -

835
01:09:28,103 --> 01:09:31,416
No. We begin by coveting
what we see every day.

836
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,777
Don't you feel eyes
moving over your body, Clarice?

837
01:09:35,527 --> 01:09:38,906
And don't your eyes
seek out the things you want?

838
01:09:39,615 --> 01:09:42,010
All right, yes. Now please tell me how.

839
01:09:42,034 --> 01:09:43,327
No.

840
01:09:44,244 --> 01:09:48,999
It is your turn to tell me, Clarice.
You don't have any more vacations to sell.

841
01:09:49,666 --> 01:09:51,752
Why did you leave that ranch?

842
01:09:52,461 --> 01:09:56,006
Doctor, we don't have any more time
for any of this now.

843
01:09:56,673 --> 01:09:59,402
But we don't reckon time
the same way, do we, Clarice?

844
01:09:59,426 --> 01:10:01,404
This is all the time you'll ever have.

845
01:10:01,428 --> 01:10:03,865
Later. Now, please, listen to me.
We've only got five -

846
01:10:03,889 --> 01:10:07,267
No! I will listen now.

847
01:10:09,478 --> 01:10:12,707
After your father's murder, you were
orphaned. You were 10 years old.

848
01:10:12,731 --> 01:10:15,818
You went to live with cousins
on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana.

849
01:10:16,485 --> 01:10:17,486
And?

850
01:10:19,696 --> 01:10:21,949
And one morning, I just ran away.

851
01:10:22,741 --> 01:10:26,179
Not “just,” Clarice. What set you off?

852
01:10:26,203 --> 01:10:28,038
You started at what time?

853
01:10:28,705 --> 01:10:30,141
Early. Still dark.

854
01:10:30,165 --> 01:10:33,061
Then something woke you, didn't it?
Was it a dream?

855
01:10:33,085 --> 01:10:34,169
What was it?

856
01:10:35,712 --> 01:10:37,464
I heard a strange noise.

857
01:10:38,715 --> 01:10:40,092
What was it?

858
01:10:40,676 --> 01:10:41,760
It was...

859
01:10:43,095 --> 01:10:44,429
screaming.

860
01:10:46,181 --> 01:10:48,892
Some kind of screaming,
like a child's voice.

861
01:10:49,476 --> 01:10:50,936
What did you do?

862
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:55,190
I went downstairs, outside.

863
01:10:57,818 --> 01:10:59,653
I crept up into the barn house.

864
01:11:00,654 --> 01:11:03,448
I was so scared to look inside,
but I had to.

865
01:11:04,616 --> 01:11:06,719
What did you see, Clarice?

866
01:11:06,743 --> 01:11:08,287
What did you see?

867
01:11:09,746 --> 01:11:10,956
Lambs.

868
01:11:12,207 --> 01:11:13,876
They were screaming.

869
01:11:14,459 --> 01:11:17,272
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?

870
01:11:17,296 --> 01:11:19,047
And they were screaming.

871
01:11:20,799 --> 01:11:22,735
And you ran away?

872
01:11:22,759 --> 01:11:23,760
No.

873
01:11:24,511 --> 01:11:26,513
First I tried to free them. I -

874
01:11:27,222 --> 01:11:29,784
I opened the gate to their pen,
but they wouldn't run.

875
01:11:29,808 --> 01:11:32,978
They just stood there, confused.
They wouldn't run.

876
01:11:33,562 --> 01:11:35,647
But you could, and you did, didn't you?

877
01:11:36,773 --> 01:11:38,084
Yes.

878
01:11:38,108 --> 01:11:40,461
I took one lamb
and I ran away as fast as I could.

879
01:11:40,485 --> 01:11:42,380
Where were you going, Clarice?

880
01:11:42,404 --> 01:11:46,843
I don't know. I didn't have any food,
any water, and it was very cold.

881
01:11:46,867 --> 01:11:48,076
It was very cold.

882
01:11:50,412 --> 01:11:51,413
I thought -

883
01:11:52,456 --> 01:11:54,666
I thought if I could save just one, but...

884
01:11:57,044 --> 01:11:58,420
he was so heavy.

885
01:11:59,630 --> 01:12:01,131
He was so heavy.

886
01:12:06,553 --> 01:12:10,265
I didn't get more than a few miles
when the sheriffs car picked me up.

887
01:12:13,727 --> 01:12:17,481
Rancher was so angry, he sent me to live
at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman.

888
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:20,359
I never saw the ranch again.

889
01:12:21,068 --> 01:12:24,154
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

890
01:12:26,114 --> 01:12:27,717
They killed him.

891
01:12:27,741 --> 01:12:30,011
You still wake up sometimes, don't you?

892
01:12:30,035 --> 01:12:31,828
Wake up in the dark

893
01:12:32,663 --> 01:12:35,457
and hear the screaming of the lambs.

894
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:37,042
Yes.

895
01:12:38,752 --> 01:12:43,066
And you think if you saved poor Catherine,
you could make them stop, don't you?

896
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:45,443
You think, if Catherine lives,

897
01:12:45,467 --> 01:12:47,803
you won't wake up in the dark ever again...

898
01:12:48,804 --> 01:12:51,723
to that awful screaming of the lambs.

899
01:12:52,891 --> 01:12:55,852
I don't know. I don't know.

900
01:12:57,938 --> 01:13:00,107
Thank you, Clarice.

901
01:13:00,774 --> 01:13:02,251
Thank you.

902
01:13:02,275 --> 01:13:03,944
Tell me his name, Doctor.

903
01:13:11,201 --> 01:13:13,286
Dr. Chilton, I presume?

904
01:13:14,287 --> 01:13:15,872
I think you know each other.

905
01:13:18,083 --> 01:13:19,334
Okay.

906
01:13:20,252 --> 01:13:22,004
- We found her.
- Let's go.

907
01:13:22,504 --> 01:13:24,006
It's your turn, Doctor.

908
01:13:24,756 --> 01:13:26,734
- Out.
- Tell me his name.

909
01:13:26,758 --> 01:13:29,529
Sorry, ma'am, I've got orders.
Have to put you on a plane.

910
01:13:29,553 --> 01:13:31,114
Come on now.

911
01:13:31,138 --> 01:13:32,723
Brave Clarice.

912
01:13:33,432 --> 01:13:37,078
You will let me know when those lambs
stop screaming, won't you?

913
01:13:37,102 --> 01:13:39,163
Tell me his name, Doctor.

914
01:13:39,187 --> 01:13:40,522
Clarice!

915
01:13:41,815 --> 01:13:43,316
Your case file.

916
01:13:45,402 --> 01:13:46,403
Hey.

917
01:13:48,447 --> 01:13:50,115
Good-bye, Clarice.

918
01:14:56,223 --> 01:14:58,076
Ready when you are, Doc.

919
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:00,185
Just another minute, please.

920
01:15:09,361 --> 01:15:12,048
Son of a bitch demanded a second dinner.

921
01:15:12,072 --> 01:15:13,925
Lamb chops. Extra rare.

922
01:15:13,949 --> 01:15:18,453
Wonder what he wants for breakfast.
Some damn thing from the zoo?

923
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:41,702
Good evening, gentlemen.

924
01:15:41,726 --> 01:15:43,996
Okay, Doc. Grab some floor.

925
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:46,106
- Same drill as before, please.
- Mm-hmm.

926
01:15:52,988 --> 01:15:54,990
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

927
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,049
Okay.

928
01:16:19,806 --> 01:16:21,808
- Hand me that, would you?
- Uh-huh.

929
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:28,190
Thanks.

930
01:16:32,110 --> 01:16:33,695
Mind the drawings, please.

931
01:16:37,115 --> 01:16:38,325
Thank you.

932
01:17:02,807 --> 01:17:04,517
Jimmy, watch it! He's got me!

933
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:13,568
Jesus Christ!

934
01:17:24,496 --> 01:17:26,122
I need help.

935
01:18:32,314 --> 01:18:34,482
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

936
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,369
What is this shit?

937
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:50,433
Did somebody go up on five?

938
01:18:50,457 --> 01:18:52,893
No. Nobody went up.

939
01:18:52,917 --> 01:18:55,754
Call Pembry. Ask him to tell -

940
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,358
<i>GP. Shots fired on five.</i>

941
01:18:59,382 --> 01:19:01,485
Repeat, shots fired on five.

942
01:19:01,509 --> 01:19:02,844
Sergeant Tate!

943
01:19:03,428 --> 01:19:05,698
<i>Shots fired on five.</i>

944
01:19:05,722 --> 01:19:08,367
- Holy shit!
- What the hell?

945
01:19:08,391 --> 01:19:10,745
- Shut up!

946
01:19:10,769 --> 01:19:12,204
Bobby, get the vest.

947
01:19:12,228 --> 01:19:13,438
Right, Sarge.

948
01:19:14,147 --> 01:19:16,483
- Brady, Howard, cover the -
- Look!

949
01:19:17,609 --> 01:19:20,653
It stopped.

950
01:19:21,988 --> 01:19:23,758
Seal off a 10-block radius.

951
01:19:23,782 --> 01:19:26,594
Get me the SWAT team
and an ambulance, double quick.

952
01:19:26,618 --> 01:19:27,911
We're goin' up.

953
01:19:57,190 --> 01:19:59,192
Pembry!

954
01:20:00,193 --> 01:20:02,195
Boyle!

955
01:20:14,707 --> 01:20:15,959
Oh, God!

956
01:20:23,049 --> 01:20:24,467
Go.

957
01:20:31,933 --> 01:20:33,452
- Clear.
- Clear.

958
01:20:33,476 --> 01:20:36,479
Command post, two officers down.

959
01:20:37,063 --> 01:20:38,707
- Clear.
- Clear!

960
01:20:38,731 --> 01:20:40,376
Lecter's gone, Sarge.

961
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,378
Prisoner is missing.

962
01:20:42,402 --> 01:20:46,799
- Boyle's gun is gone, Sergeant.
- Repeat, Lecter's missing and armed.

963
01:20:46,823 --> 01:20:49,051
He's stripped the bed.

964
01:20:49,075 --> 01:20:51,411
Might be making a rope. Check all windows.

965
01:20:51,995 --> 01:20:54,515
Where the fuck is my ambulance?

966
01:20:54,539 --> 01:20:56,124
He's alive.

967
01:20:57,041 --> 01:20:59,353
Sergeant Tate, he's alive!

968
01:20:59,377 --> 01:21:02,297
Get a hold of him where
you can feel his hands, son. Talk to him.

969
01:21:03,423 --> 01:21:04,483
What do I say?

970
01:21:04,507 --> 01:21:07,010
It's Jim Pembry! Now talk to him, damn it!

971
01:21:08,219 --> 01:21:10,739
Lecter's missing and armed.

972
01:21:10,763 --> 01:21:13,284
Pembry. Pembry, can you hear me?

973
01:21:13,308 --> 01:21:18,038
He took Boyle's gun. Pembry got off one
round. There's a chance Lecter was hit.

974
01:21:18,062 --> 01:21:20,416
Keep breathing in and out. That's it.

975
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:23,443
You're doing a good job.
Oh, you look real good there.

976
01:21:24,527 --> 01:21:27,489
Yeah, you look... real good.

977
01:21:44,422 --> 01:21:45,691
- You ready?
- Let's go.

978
01:21:45,715 --> 01:21:47,300
- Let's do it.
- Okay? Let's go.

979
01:21:52,931 --> 01:21:54,349
- Got it?
- Yeah.

980
01:21:58,686 --> 01:22:00,748
Lookin' good, Pembry.
You're gonna make it.

981
01:22:00,772 --> 01:22:03,250
You're doin' just fine.
You're doin' all right. That's right.

982
01:22:03,274 --> 01:22:05,586
- Okay, I need that IV now!
- Lactated Ringer's.

983
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:08,172
Can we get the strap?
Buzz, where's the fuckin' oxygen?

984
01:22:08,196 --> 01:22:11,282
Lookin' good, buddy. That's right.
Stay with me. Stay with me here.

985
01:22:13,368 --> 01:22:15,495
We're losin' him. Downstairs, quickly!

986
01:22:16,371 --> 01:22:17,956
And up!

987
01:22:19,165 --> 01:22:21,251
- Elevator! Out of the way!
- Clear the way!

988
01:22:21,751 --> 01:22:23,086
Get out of the way.

989
01:22:26,172 --> 01:22:28,442
CP <i>to Tate.</i>

990
01:22:28,466 --> 01:22:31,052
Uh, roger, Lieutenant. Tate here.

991
01:22:31,678 --> 01:22:33,805
I'm on the elevator bringin' Pembry down.

992
01:22:34,806 --> 01:22:36,391
He seems to be hangin' on.

993
01:22:37,392 --> 01:22:38,977
Top three floors secured.

994
01:22:40,019 --> 01:22:41,604
Main stairwell secured.

995
01:22:43,064 --> 01:22:44,566
We think he's on two.

996
01:22:58,246 --> 01:23:00,248
<i>Tate? You still with me?</i>

997
01:23:01,958 --> 01:23:04,687
Uh, we're pretty sure
he's somewhere on two, sir.

998
01:23:04,711 --> 01:23:06,504
That's all for now. Over.

999
01:23:26,232 --> 01:23:28,234
He's on the roof of the elevator.

1000
01:23:31,404 --> 01:23:32,614
Okay, guys-

1001
01:23:49,422 --> 01:23:53,217
I see him. There's a gun by his hand.
He's not moving.

1002
01:23:54,010 --> 01:23:56,846
- One warning. We need him alive.
- Got it.

1003
01:23:57,930 --> 01:23:59,283
Lecter?

1004
01:23:59,307 --> 01:24:01,017
Put your hands on your head.

1005
01:24:03,770 --> 01:24:05,021
One in the leg.

1006
01:24:16,449 --> 01:24:17,533
No movement.

1007
01:24:19,035 --> 01:24:21,287
Johnny, hold your fire.
We're coming into the car.

1008
01:24:22,288 --> 01:24:23,581
We're opening the hatch.

1009
01:24:24,582 --> 01:24:25,809
Watch his hands.

1010
01:24:25,833 --> 01:24:27,978
If there's any fire, it'll come from us.

1011
01:24:28,002 --> 01:24:29,837
- Affirm?
- Got it.

1012
01:24:56,197 --> 01:24:58,384
Memphis General, this is Medical Unit 26.

1013
01:24:58,408 --> 01:25:01,095
We're inbound
with a 50-year-old male police officer

1014
01:25:01,119 --> 01:25:02,930
with severe facial lacerations.

1015
01:25:02,954 --> 01:25:06,684
Weapon unknown. We've got grand mal
seizure activity, but he's postictal now.

1016
01:25:06,708 --> 01:25:07,685
<i>COPY-</i>

1017
01:25:07,709 --> 01:25:10,646
Uh, vital signs are good.
Pressure is 130 over 90.

1018
01:25:10,670 --> 01:25:13,273
- Ninety?
- Yeah, that's right, 90. Pulse 84.

1019
01:25:13,297 --> 01:25:15,401
We've got him on
lactated Ringer's running,

1020
01:25:15,425 --> 01:25:18,302
and, uh - and the, uh, patient
is on 10 liters of oxygen.

1021
01:25:19,387 --> 01:25:20,888
Watch it!

1022
01:25:25,059 --> 01:25:28,414
They found the ambulance
in a parking garage at Memphis Airport.

1023
01:25:28,438 --> 01:25:29,647
Crew was dead.

1024
01:25:30,648 --> 01:25:32,751
He killed a tourist too.

1025
01:25:32,775 --> 01:25:34,837
Got his clothes, cash.

1026
01:25:34,861 --> 01:25:37,131
By now he could be anywhere.

1027
01:25:37,155 --> 01:25:38,549
He won't come after me.

1028
01:25:38,573 --> 01:25:40,074
- Oh, really?
- He won't.

1029
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:44,596
I can't explain it.
He - He would consider that rude.

1030
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:47,641
It's over. She's dead.

1031
01:25:47,665 --> 01:25:49,727
It's not your fault it
worked out like this.

1032
01:25:49,751 --> 01:25:53,731
Lecter said everything we need to catch him
with is right here in these pages.

1033
01:25:53,755 --> 01:25:56,174
Dr. Lecter said a lot of things.

1034
01:25:56,841 --> 01:25:58,134
He's here, Ardelia.

1035
01:26:27,622 --> 01:26:29,207
Is this Lecter's handwriting?

1036
01:26:31,667 --> 01:26:36,231
“Clarice, doesn't this random scattering
of sites seem desperately random?

1037
01:26:36,255 --> 01:26:40,235
Like the elaboration of a bad liar.
Ta, Hannibal Lecter.”

1038
01:26:40,259 --> 01:26:42,946
“Desperately random.” What does he mean?

1039
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:46,432
Not random at all maybe.
Like there's some pattern here.

1040
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:50,704
Yeah, but there is no pattern,
or the computers would've nailed it.

1041
01:26:50,728 --> 01:26:52,814
They were even found in random order.

1042
01:26:53,397 --> 01:26:55,501
Random because of the one girl.

1043
01:26:55,525 --> 01:26:57,026
The one he weighted down.

1044
01:26:57,527 --> 01:26:59,880
- Oh, Frederica Bimmel.
- Right.

1045
01:26:59,904 --> 01:27:03,467
Yeah, from Belvedere, Ohio.

1046
01:27:03,491 --> 01:27:07,304
First girl taken. Third body found. Why?

1047
01:27:07,328 --> 01:27:09,515
Well, she didn't drift.
He weighted her down.

1048
01:27:09,539 --> 01:27:13,018
What did Lecter say
about the first principles?

1049
01:27:13,042 --> 01:27:14,418
Simplicity.

1050
01:27:14,961 --> 01:27:17,588
What does this guy do? He covets.

1051
01:27:18,339 --> 01:27:20,984
How do we first start to covet?

1052
01:27:21,008 --> 01:27:22,861
We covet what we see -

1053
01:27:22,885 --> 01:27:24,136
Every day-

1054
01:27:26,597 --> 01:27:29,016
- Hot damn, Clarice.
- He knew her.

1055
01:28:45,051 --> 01:28:47,345
- Mr. Bimmel?
- That's me.

1056
01:28:48,179 --> 01:28:50,848
Hello. I'm Clarice Starling.
I'm with the FBI.

1057
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:57,438
I sure appreciate you letting me
take a look around, Mr. Bimmel.

1058
01:28:58,439 --> 01:29:00,834
I don't know nothin' new to tell ya.

1059
01:29:00,858 --> 01:29:03,194
Police been back here
so many times already.

1060
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:08,115
Frederica went into Chicago
on the bus to see about a job.

1061
01:29:08,699 --> 01:29:12,244
She left the interview okay.
She never come home.

1062
01:29:14,956 --> 01:29:18,709
Her bedroom's how she left it. Upstairs.

1063
01:29:19,335 --> 01:29:20,628
Door to the left.

1064
01:32:06,001 --> 01:32:08,271
He's making himself
a woman suit, Mr. Crawford,

1065
01:32:08,295 --> 01:32:09,606
out of real women!

1066
01:32:09,630 --> 01:32:12,359
And he can sew, this guy.
He-He's very skilled.

1067
01:32:12,383 --> 01:32:14,861
- He's a tailor or a dressmaker or -
- Starling -

1068
01:32:14,885 --> 01:32:16,071
That's why they're all big.

1069
01:32:16,095 --> 01:32:18,740
He has to keep them alive
so he can starve them a while,

1070
01:32:18,764 --> 01:32:20,117
so he can loosen their skin -

1071
01:32:20,141 --> 01:32:24,496
<i>Starling, Starling, we know who he is and
where he is. We're on our way right now.</i>

1072
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:27,916
- Where?
- Calumet City, edge of Chicago.

1073
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:31,294
- Be on the ground in 45 minutes with HRT.
- Oh, <i>that's -</i>

1074
01:32:31,318 --> 01:32:34,881
<i>- That's</i> great <i>news, sir, but how -</i>
- <i>Johns Hopkins came up with some names.</i>

1075
01:32:34,905 --> 01:32:36,550
<i>We fed 'em into known offenders.</i>

1076
01:32:36,574 --> 01:32:40,720
Subject's name is Jame Gumb,
aka John Grant.

1077
01:32:40,744 --> 01:32:43,515
<i>Lecter's description was accurate.
He just lied about the name.</i>

1078
01:32:43,539 --> 01:32:44,599
<i>Listen to this.</i>

1079
01:32:44,623 --> 01:32:46,977
Customs had some paper on him.

1080
01:32:47,001 --> 01:32:50,230
They stopped a carton
two years ago at LAX:

1081
01:32:50,254 --> 01:32:52,607
live caterpillars from Suriname.

1082
01:32:52,631 --> 01:32:55,593
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.

1083
01:32:56,177 --> 01:32:58,238
Well, Chicago's only 400 miles from here.

1084
01:32:58,262 --> 01:33:00,115
- I'll be there in -
- No, no, no, Starling.

1085
01:33:00,139 --> 01:33:03,618
There's not enough time.
We want him for murder, not kidnapping.

1086
01:33:03,642 --> 01:33:06,079
I need you to link him to the Bimmel girl
before he's indicted.

1087
01:33:06,103 --> 01:33:09,166
- See what you can dredge up in Belvedere.
- Yes, sir. You bet.

1088
01:33:09,190 --> 01:33:11,108
- I'll <i>do my best.
- Starling.</i>

1089
01:33:11,901 --> 01:33:15,613
We wouldn't have found him without you.
Nobody's gonna forget that.

1090
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:17,781
<i>Least of all me.</i>

1091
01:33:18,949 --> 01:33:20,385
Thank you, sir.

1092
01:33:20,409 --> 01:33:22,411
Thank you very much, Mr. Crawford.

1093
01:33:23,871 --> 01:33:25,331
Mr. Crawford?

1094
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:42,139
Thanks for the scraps, asshole.
I got a better idea.

1095
01:33:45,392 --> 01:33:46,602
Yeah.

1096
01:34:03,744 --> 01:34:05,496
Okay, Precious, time for a little treat.

1097
01:34:19,385 --> 01:34:20,469
Precious.

1098
01:34:37,653 --> 01:34:38,946
Come on, Precious.

1099
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:52,418
Precious!

1100
01:34:53,168 --> 01:34:55,421
Are you out there, you little shit?

1101
01:34:56,505 --> 01:34:58,340
Come and get it, pretty girl.

1102
01:35:04,930 --> 01:35:07,284
Precious.

1103
01:35:07,308 --> 01:35:09,560
Please come. Come on.

1104
01:35:16,567 --> 01:35:19,361
Come on, Precious.

1105
01:35:25,784 --> 01:35:27,786
Precious, come on.

1106
01:35:31,123 --> 01:35:32,767
Will you fuck me?

1107
01:35:32,791 --> 01:35:35,544
Come on. Take that bone. Come on.

1108
01:35:36,628 --> 01:35:39,649
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1109
01:35:39,673 --> 01:35:41,258
I'd fuck me.

1110
01:35:42,009 --> 01:35:43,052
Come on.

1111
01:35:47,014 --> 01:35:48,849
I'd fuck me hard.

1112
01:35:49,475 --> 01:35:52,519
I'd fuck me so hard.

1113
01:35:56,148 --> 01:35:57,399
No!

1114
01:36:21,382 --> 01:36:28,305
<i>- 4' I'm lyin', lyin', lyin' 4'
- 4' I'm lyin', lyin', lyin' over you 4'</i>

1115
01:36:58,335 --> 01:37:00,480
Is that a good job, FBI agent?

1116
01:37:00,504 --> 01:37:04,675
You get to travel around and stuff?
I mean, better places than this?

1117
01:37:05,676 --> 01:37:07,678
Sometimes you do.

1118
01:37:08,929 --> 01:37:12,766
Freddie was so happy for me
when I got this job at the bank.

1119
01:37:13,434 --> 01:37:17,539
Toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow
on the speakers all day.

1120
01:37:17,563 --> 01:37:19,648
She thought it was such hot shit.

1121
01:37:20,566 --> 01:37:22,568
What did she know? Big dummy.

1122
01:37:23,068 --> 01:37:27,424
Stacy, did Frederica ever mention
a man named “Jamie” Gumb

1123
01:37:27,448 --> 01:37:29,074
or a Jame Gumb?

1124
01:37:29,825 --> 01:37:31,743
- How about John Grant?
- No.

1125
01:37:32,244 --> 01:37:34,722
Would she have had a friend
you didn't know about?

1126
01:37:34,746 --> 01:37:39,209
No way. If she had a guy, I'd have known.
Believe me. Sewing was her life.

1127
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:42,272
- Did you two ever work together or -
- Oh, sure.

1128
01:37:42,296 --> 01:37:46,425
Me and Pam Malavesi used to help her
do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman.

1129
01:37:47,009 --> 01:37:49,845
Can you give me Mrs. Lippman's address?
I need to talk to her.

1130
01:38:18,665 --> 01:38:21,835
So powerful. So beautiful.

1131
01:38:27,257 --> 01:38:30,427
Precious?

1132
01:38:34,515 --> 01:38:37,809
- Precious?
- Down here, you sack of shit!

1133
01:38:46,527 --> 01:38:48,087
- Put her in that bucket.
- No.

1134
01:38:48,111 --> 01:38:51,114
You get me a telephone
and lower it down here, now!

1135
01:38:54,159 --> 01:38:58,264
Oh, poodlie-poo, Precious.
Darling, are you all right?

1136
01:38:58,288 --> 01:39:01,416
She's in a lot of pain, mister.
She needs a vet.

1137
01:39:05,671 --> 01:39:08,441
She broke her leg on the way down.
I know it.

1138
01:39:08,465 --> 01:39:10,693
- She's been licking it -
- Hey, don't you hurt my dog!

1139
01:39:10,717 --> 01:39:12,779
Don't you make me hurt your dog!

1140
01:39:12,803 --> 01:39:15,055
You don't know what pain is!

1141
01:39:20,394 --> 01:39:24,064
Get me a live telephone
and lower it down here, and do it now!

1142
01:39:28,527 --> 01:39:31,530
- You fucking - Oh, fuck!
- You better be getting me that telephone!

1143
01:39:32,948 --> 01:39:35,158
I'm gonna do it, mister!

1144
01:39:36,368 --> 01:39:38,370
I'll cut her neck off, I swear to God!

1145
01:39:39,955 --> 01:39:41,995
- All right, mister, I'm doing it!
- Motherfucking -

1146
01:39:49,673 --> 01:39:53,135
I'm in here! Here!

1147
01:40:05,355 --> 01:40:07,357
Okay, I'm coming.

1148
01:40:09,067 --> 01:40:10,277
We're goin' in.

1149
01:40:15,324 --> 01:40:17,844
Good afternoon. Um, sorry to bother you.

1150
01:40:17,868 --> 01:40:20,037
I'm looking for Mrs. Lippman's family.

1151
01:40:20,787 --> 01:40:23,290
- FBI! Everybody down!
- FBI! Down, now!

1152
01:40:23,874 --> 01:40:25,584
The Lippmans don't live here anymore.

1153
01:40:26,084 --> 01:40:28,378
Excuse me, sir.
I really need to speak with you.

1154
01:40:29,671 --> 01:40:31,340
- Clear!
- Clear!

1155
01:40:32,049 --> 01:40:34,277
What's the problem, Officer?

1156
01:40:34,301 --> 01:40:37,095
Well, I'm investigating
the death of Frederica Bimmel.

1157
01:40:40,557 --> 01:40:41,892
There's no one here, Jack.

1158
01:40:44,728 --> 01:40:45,997
Clarice.

1159
01:40:46,021 --> 01:40:47,457
Your name is?

1160
01:40:47,481 --> 01:40:50,084
- Oh, uh, Jack Gordon.
- Mr. Gordon. Good.

1161
01:40:50,108 --> 01:40:54,112
Um, well, Frederica used to work
for Mrs. Lippman. Did you know her?

1162
01:40:55,113 --> 01:40:56,615
No. Uh-uh.

1163
01:40:57,240 --> 01:41:01,286
Oh, wait. Was she a great big, fat person?

1164
01:41:02,245 --> 01:41:04,098
Yeah, she was a big girl, sir.

1165
01:41:04,122 --> 01:41:07,668
Yeah, I - I may have see -
No, I read about her in the newspaper.

1166
01:41:08,335 --> 01:41:11,731
Um, Mrs. Lippman had a son though.

1167
01:41:11,755 --> 01:41:14,484
Maybe he could help you.
I got his card in here someplace.

1168
01:41:14,508 --> 01:41:16,569
- Do you wanna come in while I look for it?
- May I?

1169
01:41:16,593 --> 01:41:18,095
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

1170
01:41:37,239 --> 01:41:39,408
Are you close
to catching somebody, you think?

1171
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:43,078
Yes. We may be.

1172
01:41:45,414 --> 01:41:50,752
Did you... take over this place
after Mrs. Lippman died? Is that right?

1173
01:41:52,170 --> 01:41:56,800
Yeah. I bought this house,
uh, two years ago.

1174
01:41:58,051 --> 01:42:01,054
Did she leave any records?
Any business records?

1175
01:42:01,638 --> 01:42:04,850
Tax forms? Um, list of employees?

1176
01:42:05,642 --> 01:42:07,477
No, nothing like that at all.

1177
01:42:10,355 --> 01:42:12,441
Say, has the FBI learned something?

1178
01:42:13,442 --> 01:42:16,194
The police around here
don't seem to have the first clue.

1179
01:42:26,246 --> 01:42:31,001
I mean, have you got like a description,
fingerprints, anything like that?

1180
01:42:32,377 --> 01:42:33,521
No.

1181
01:42:33,545 --> 01:42:34,629
Mm-hmm.

1182
01:42:36,006 --> 01:42:37,215
No, we don't.

1183
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:48,101
Ah.

1184
01:42:48,727 --> 01:42:49,936
Here's that number.

1185
01:42:51,688 --> 01:42:54,900
Very good, Mr. Gordon.
May I use your phone, please?

1186
01:43:02,324 --> 01:43:05,243
Sure, you can use my phone.

1187
01:43:07,037 --> 01:43:08,038
Freeze!

1188
01:43:09,164 --> 01:43:11,559
Put your hands over your head
and turn around!

1189
01:43:11,583 --> 01:43:12,793
Spread your legs!

1190
01:43:14,503 --> 01:43:15,772
Spread your legs!

1191
01:43:15,796 --> 01:43:17,648
Put your hands in the back, thumbs up -

1192
01:43:17,672 --> 01:43:19,216
Freeze!

1193
01:44:31,872 --> 01:44:33,123
Hey!

1194
01:44:53,768 --> 01:44:55,770
Hello? Are you there?

1195
01:44:57,522 --> 01:45:00,108
I'm down here! I'm down here!

1196
01:45:19,544 --> 01:45:21,046
Catherine Martin?

1197
01:45:21,713 --> 01:45:22,923
Yes!

1198
01:45:24,799 --> 01:45:27,302
FBI! You're safe!

1199
01:45:27,802 --> 01:45:30,221
Safe? Shit. Get me outta here!

1200
01:45:45,820 --> 01:45:47,882
You're all right, Catherine.
Now where is he?

1201
01:45:47,906 --> 01:45:51,052
How the fuck should I know?
Just get me outta here!

1202
01:45:51,076 --> 01:45:54,263
Catherine, you gotta be quiet.
Now shut that dog up!

1203
01:45:54,287 --> 01:45:56,498
Just get me outta here!

1204
01:45:57,082 --> 01:45:58,750
Oh, God.

1205
01:46:01,169 --> 01:46:02,170
Catherine,

1206
01:46:02,754 --> 01:46:05,524
I'm gonna get you outta there,
but right now you listen to me.

1207
01:46:05,548 --> 01:46:07,717
I've gotta leave this room.
I'll be right back.

1208
01:46:08,343 --> 01:46:11,822
No, don't you leave me here,
you fuckin' bitch! No!

1209
01:46:11,846 --> 01:46:15,934
Don't you leave me here!
This guy's fuckin' crazy!

1210
01:46:18,728 --> 01:46:20,105
Please!

1211
01:46:20,855 --> 01:46:23,692
I gotta get outta here!

1212
01:46:24,985 --> 01:46:26,170
Plea -

1213
01:46:26,194 --> 01:46:30,281
Catherine, the other officers
will be here any minute now!

1214
01:46:31,074 --> 01:46:33,052
Wait!

1215
01:46:33,076 --> 01:46:35,912
- Don't go! Wait!
- Shh! Quiet!

1216
01:46:36,997 --> 01:46:40,834
Come back.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1217
01:47:38,933 --> 01:47:40,935
[Grunts, pants]

1218
01:50:26,643 --> 01:50:27,936
No.

1219
01:50:37,362 --> 01:50:40,007
- You okay?
- Gunpowder. It's nothing. I'm okay.

1220
01:50:40,031 --> 01:50:42,784
Agent Starling, how did you
track Buffalo Bill to this address?

1221
01:50:49,082 --> 01:50:51,376
Clarice M. Starling.

1222
01:50:54,003 --> 01:50:55,421
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1223
01:51:08,977 --> 01:51:11,187
Ernest W. Stevens.

1224
01:51:29,747 --> 01:51:33,102
- Special Agent Starling.
- Oh, Special Agent Mapp.

1225
01:51:33,126 --> 01:51:35,729
- Phone call.
- Oh, thank you. Excuse me, gentlemen.

1226
01:51:35,753 --> 01:51:36,754
Starling?

1227
01:51:39,757 --> 01:51:42,194
Pilch. Would you take our picture?

1228
01:51:42,218 --> 01:51:43,428
Sure.

1229
01:51:45,263 --> 01:51:47,265
Look, I just wanted to say
congratulations.

1230
01:51:48,433 --> 01:51:51,936
And I'm not much good at this kind of
thing, so I'm gonna duck outta here.

1231
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:54,147
Okay. Sure. Um -

1232
01:51:55,356 --> 01:51:57,191
Thank you, Mr. Crawford.

1233
01:52:00,737 --> 01:52:01,737
Um-

1234
01:52:05,074 --> 01:52:07,243
Your father would've been proud today.

1235
01:52:10,246 --> 01:52:11,914
Don't forget your phone call.

1236
01:52:16,961 --> 01:52:17,962
Starling.

1237
01:52:18,504 --> 01:52:20,131
<i>Well, Clarice.</i>

1238
01:52:20,715 --> 01:52:23,235
Have the lambs stopped screaming?

1239
01:52:23,259 --> 01:52:26,071
<i>- Dr. Lester.
- Don't bother with a trace.</i>

1240
01:52:26,095 --> 01:52:27,972
I won't be on long enough.

1241
01:52:31,142 --> 01:52:32,894
Where are you, Dr. Lecter?

1242
01:52:33,728 --> 01:52:35,873
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice.

1243
01:52:35,897 --> 01:52:38,358
The world's more interesting
with you in it.

1244
01:52:38,941 --> 01:52:42,087
<i>So you take care now
to extend me the same courtesy.</i>

1245
01:52:42,111 --> 01:52:44,113
You know I can't make that promise.

1246
01:52:44,697 --> 01:52:47,450
I do wish we could chat longer, but...

1247
01:52:48,785 --> 01:52:51,037
I'm having an old friend for dinner.

1248
01:52:52,747 --> 01:52:53,831
Bye.

1249
01:52:54,665 --> 01:52:55,750
<i>Dr. Lecter!</i>

1250
01:52:58,378 --> 01:52:59,462
Dr. Lecter?

1251
01:53:02,173 --> 01:53:03,257
Dr. Lecter?

1252
01:53:05,635 --> 01:53:06,761
Dr. Lecter?

1253
01:53:07,637 --> 01:53:09,472
Very important -
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.
