1
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,106
What the fuck is that?

2
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,983
Jimmy?

3
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,027
-What's up?
-Did I hit something?

4
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,862
What the fuck is that?

5
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,531
Maybe you got a flat?

6
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,659
Wha--? No.

7
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,246
What the fuck?
You better pull over and see.

8
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,651
He's still alive. You fucking piece of shit!

9
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,654
Die, you motherfucker! Look at me!

10
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:07,084
As far back as I can remember,
I always wanted to be a gangster.

11
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,083
To me...

12
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:52,504
...being a gangster was better than
being president of the United States.

13
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,344
Even before I first wandered
into the cabstand for an after-school job...

14
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,597
I knew I wanted to be a part of them.

15
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,183
It was there that I knew I belonged.

16
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,854
To me, it meant being somebody
in a neighborhood full of nobodies.

17
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,107
They weren't like anybody else.
They did whatever they wanted.

18
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,861
They double-parked in front of a hydrant,
nobody ever gave them a ticket.

19
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,238
In the summer,
when they played cards all night...

20
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,657
...nobody ever called the cops.

21
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,713
Tony Stacks. How are you?

22
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,507
Tuddy Cicero.

23
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,927
Could this be the Canarsie Kid?

24
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,095
-How are you?
-Good.

25
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,556
Tuddy.

26
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,518
Tuddy ran the cabstand
and the Bella Vista Pizzeria...

27
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:53,315
and other places for his brother, Paul,
who was the boss of the neighborhood.

28
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,239
Paulie might have moved slow...

29
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,662
but it was only because Paulie
didn't have to move for anybody.

30
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,960
-It's your fault.
-You started it.

31
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,170
I started it? It's your fault.

32
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,506
At first my parents loved
that I found a job...

33
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,758
across the street from the house.

34
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:24,638
My father, who was Irish,
was sent to work at the age of 11.

35
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,723
He liked that I got myself a job.

36
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:30,435
He always used to say
that American kids were spoiled lazy.

37
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,855
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.

38
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,649
See you, Mikey.

39
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,025
Bye, Henry.

40
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,361
Henry! Watch how you cross!

41
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,779
Bring back milk!

42
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,074
My mother was happy after
she found out that the Ciceros...

43
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,786
came from the same part of Sicily
as she did. To my mother...

44
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,747
that was the answer to all her prayers.

45
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,668
I was the luckiest kid in the world.

46
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,671
I could go anywhere, I could do anything.

47
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,507
I knew everybody,
and everybody knew me.

48
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,719
Wiseguys would pull up
and Tuddy would toss me their keys...

49
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,637
and let me park their Cadillacs.

50
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:09,391
Here I am, this little kid,
I can't even see over the steering wheel...

51
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,727
and I'm parking Cadillacs.

52
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,107
But it wasn't too long...

53
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:21,069
before my parents changed
their minds about my job at the cabstand.

54
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,863
For your mother and sister.

55
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,408
For them, the cabstand was
supposed to be a part-time job. But for me...

56
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,535
it was definitely full-time.

57
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,620
That's all I wanted to do.

58
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:34,958
People like my father could never
understand, but I was a part of something.

59
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,919
I belonged. I was treated like a grown-up.

60
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,255
Tell him 519.

61
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,424
Every day I was learning to score.

62
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,093
A dollar here, a dollar there.

63
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,179
I was living in a fantasy.

64
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,266
Did you have a good day at school?

65
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,226
My father was always pissed off.

66
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,520
Pissed that he made such lousy money...

67
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,607
pissed that my kid brother Michael
was in a wheelchair.

68
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:03,028
He was pissed that there were seven of us
living in such a tiny house.

69
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,905
Tell me about this.

70
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,616
It's a letter from school.

71
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,952
It says you haven't been there in months.

72
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,538
In months!

73
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,666
You're a bum!

74
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,086
Want to grow up to be a bum?

75
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,800
After a while, he was mostly pissed
because I hung around the cabstand.

76
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,843
He knew what went on at that cabstand.

77
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:31,640
Every once in a while, I'd have to take
a beating. But by then, I didn't care.

78
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,683
The way I saw it...

79
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,645
everybody takes a beating sometime.

80
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,858
-I can't make any more deliveries.
-What? You'll fuck everything up.

81
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,944
My dad says he'll kill me. Look.

82
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,404
Come on with me.

83
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,614
- Is that him, kid?
- No.

84
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,991
- How about him?
- No.

85
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,037
-That's the guy.
-Get him.

86
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,165
Excuse me.

87
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,002
-Scumbag.
-Come here, you piece of shit.

88
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,929
-Know this kid?
-Yeah.

89
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,764
- Know where he lives?
- Yeah.

90
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,058
- You deliver mail to his house?
- Yeah.

91
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:19,062
From now on, any letter from that
school to his house comes directly here.

92
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,522
- Understand?
- Yeah.

93
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,275
Another letter from that school
goes to that kid's house...

94
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,819
in the fucking oven you'll go, head first.

95
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:30,282
That was it. No more letters from
truant officers. No letters from school.

96
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,534
In fact, no more letters from anybody.

97
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:36,496
Finally after a few weeks, my mother
went to the post office to complain.

98
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,498
How could I go to school after that...

99
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:42,794
and pledge allegiance to the flag
and sit through good government bullshit?

100
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:49,050
Paulie hated phones.
He wouldn't have one in his house.

101
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,887
Mickey called. Want me to call him back?

102
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,889
All right, make the call.

103
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:57,642
He got all his calls second hand.
Then you'd have to call the people back...

104
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,852
from an outside phone.

105
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,480
Got a nickel? Get him on the phone.

106
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:06,985
There were guys, that's all they did
all day, was take care of Paulie's calls.

107
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:20,916
For a guy who moved all day long,
Paulie didn't talk to six people.

108
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,085
If there was a union problem
or, say, a beef in the numbers...

109
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:27,756
only the top guys could meet
with Paulie to discuss the problem.

110
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:31,176
Everything was one-on-one.
Paulie hated conferences.

111
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,387
He didn't want anybody
hearing what he said...

112
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,849
and he didn't want anybody listening
to what he was being told.

113
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:42,270
Hundreds of guys depended on Paulie,
he got a piece of everything they made.

114
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:46,775
It was a tribute, like in the old country,
except they were doing it in America.

115
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:51,404
All they got from Paulie was protection
from other guys looking to rip them off.

116
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:55,492
That's what it's all about. That's what
the FBI could never understand.

117
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,119
What Paulie and the Organization does...

118
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:02,207
is offer protection for people
who can't go to the cops. That's it.

119
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,920
That's all it is. They're like
the police department for wiseguys.

120
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,809
People looked at me differently,
and they knew I was with somebody.

121
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:25,438
I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery
on Sunday mornings for fresh bread.

122
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,856
The owner knew who I was with...

123
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:30,402
and he'd come from around the counter.
No matter how many were waiting...

124
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,571
I was taken care of first.

125
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,156
Our neighbors didn't park
in our driveway anymore...

126
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,159
even though we didn't have a car.
At 13...

127
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,996
I was making more money than most
of the grown-ups around.

128
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:44,291
I had more money than I could spend.
I had it all.

129
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:59,097
One day, some neighborhood kids carried
my mother's groceries all the way home.

130
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,682
You know why?

131
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,351
It was out of respect.

132
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,188
Hi, Mom, what do you think?

133
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,526
-Look at my shoes, aren't they great?
-My God.

134
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,695
You look like a gangster.

135
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,530
They shot me. Help!

136
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,951
Henry, shut the door.

137
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,247
That was the first time
I had ever seen anyone shot.

138
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,459
Can't have that in here. Jesus Christ!

139
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,252
I can't have that in this joint.

140
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,212
I remember feeling bad about the guy...

141
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,507
but I also remember feeling
that maybe Tuddy was right.

142
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,385
I knew Paulie didn't want
anybody dying in the building.

143
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:41,389
You're a real jerk. You wasted
eight fucking aprons on this guy.

144
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,726
What the hell's wrong with you?
I got to toughen this kid up.

145
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,414
It was a glorious time.

146
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,918
And wiseguys were all over the place.

147
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,838
It was before Apalachin
and before Crazy Joe...

148
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,925
decided to take on a boss and start a war.

149
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,636
It was when I met the world.

150
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,514
And it was when I first met
Jimmy Conway.

151
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:27,143
He couldn't have been more than 28 or 29
at the time...

152
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,229
but he was already a legend.

153
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:33,400
He'd walk in the door and everybody
who worked the room just went wild.

154
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,152
He'd give the doorman $100
just for opening the door.

155
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,240
He'd give hundreds to the dealers
and the guys who ran the games.

156
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,368
The bartender got $100
just for keeping the ice cubes cold.

157
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,621
The Irishman is here
to take all you guineas' money.

158
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,585
-Want a drink?
-Give me a 7 and 7.

159
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,096
-I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.
-How you doing?

160
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,184
-Thank you.
-Keep them coming.

161
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,354
Jimmy was one of the most
feared guys in the city.

162
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,148
He was first locked up at 11...

163
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,401
and he was doing hits
for mob bosses when he was 16.

164
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,362
See, hits never bothered Jimmy.
It was business.

165
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,906
But what Jimmy really loved to do...

166
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,117
what he really loved to do was steal.

167
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,453
He actually enjoyed it.

168
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,540
Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted
for the bad guys in the movies.

169
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,001
Give me your wallet.

170
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,174
You might know who we are,
but we know who you are. Understand?

171
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,718
He was one of
the city's biggest hijackers...

172
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:45,346
of booze, cigarettes, razor blades,
shrimp and lobsters.

173
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,641
Shrimp and lobsters were best.
They went really fast.

174
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:52,604
Almost all of them were gimmies.
They just gave it up, no problem.

175
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,439
They called him Jimmy the Gent.

176
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,732
Help the lady.

177
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,193
Drivers loved him.
They used to tip him off...

178
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,696
about the really good loads.
Of course, everybody got a piece.

179
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,948
Thanks, I'll be back for the rest later.

180
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,533
Okay, see you later.

181
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,704
Henry, come here.

182
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,665
-Say hello to Tommy.
-How're you doing, Henry?

183
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,834
You're gonna be working together, okay?

184
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,711
Help him. Go ahead.

185
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,380
Jimmy, you got anything good?

186
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:23,593
And when the cops assigned a
whole army to stop Jimmy, what did he do?

187
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:24,803
How're you doing?

188
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,679
He made them partners.

189
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,473
I'd complain, but who'd listen?

190
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,433
- One Pall Mall.
- There you go.

191
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,685
- What do you need?
- Two Luckies.

192
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,729
- Here you go, Henry.
- Thanks a lot.

193
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:35,939
What do you need?

194
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,733
-One Pall Mall.
-One Pall Mall, here you go.

195
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,568
-What are you doing?
-It's all right.

196
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,738
-You have permission from your mother?
-How many cartons you need?

197
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,950
-Where'd you get the cigarettes?
-Get him out of here.

198
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,743
-It's okay.
-It's not okay.

199
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:52,288
- You don't understand.
- You don't understand. Store's closed.

200
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,962
-Henry got pinched.
-Where?

201
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,797
By the factory, selling cigarettes.

202
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,926
Henry Hill. The People of
the State of New York vs. Henry Hill.

203
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:08,012
Docket number 704162.

204
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,391
Uh, yes, sir. That's me.

205
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,938
Just stand there. Now stay there.

206
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,113
Counselor, proceed.

207
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,742
Congratulations.

208
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,870
Here's your graduation present.

209
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,081
-What for? I got pinched.
-Everyone does, but you did it right.

210
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,292
You told them nothing,
and they got nothing.

211
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,628
-I thought you'd be mad.
-I'm not mad, I'm proud of you.

212
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:45,091
You took your first pinch like a man
and learned the two greatest things in life.

213
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,594
-What?
-Look at me.

214
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,430
Never rat on your friends...

215
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,932
and always keep your mouth shut.

216
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,478
Here he is.

217
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,814
You broke your cherry.

218
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,489
Congratulations!

219
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,444
By the time I grew up,
there was $30 billion a year in cargo...

220
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,363
moving through Idlewild Airport...

221
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,616
and believe me,
we tried to steal every bit of it.

222
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,535
See, you gotta understand,
we grew up near the airport.

223
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,204
It belonged to Paulie.

224
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,040
We had friends and relatives
who worked all over the place.

225
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:03,044
They would tip us off about
what was coming in and moving out.

226
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,297
If any truckers or airlines
gave us trouble...

227
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:10,551
Paulie had the union people scare them
with a strike. It was beautiful.

228
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:14,514
It was a bigger moneymaker than numbers
and Jimmy was in charge of it all.

229
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,475
Whenever we needed money,
we'd rob the airport.

230
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,103
To us, it was better than Citibank.

231
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,574
You got a phone? Come on!

232
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:37,495
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you believe that shit?

233
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,168
There was Jimmy...

234
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,962
and Tommy and me.

235
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,964
And there was Anthony Stabile.

236
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,674
How're you doing?

237
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,426
Frankie Carbone.

238
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,597
And then there was Mo Black's brother,
Fat Andy.

239
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,684
And his guys, Frankie the Wop.

240
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,521
Freddy No Nose.

241
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:08,985
And then there was Pete the Killer,
who was Sally Balls' brother.

242
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,281
Then you had Nickey Eyes...

243
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,284
and Mikey Franzese.

244
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,869
That guy, I wanna see him.

245
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,664
Jimmy Two Times, who got that nickname
because he said everything twice.

246
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,333
I'm gonna go get the papers,
get the papers.

247
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:40,266
What is this? Coats?
Henry, I need suits, not coats.

248
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,226
Suits are coming Thursday.

249
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,313
But it's the middle of summer.
What'll I do with fur coats?

250
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,607
You don't want furs? I'll take them away.

251
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:52,403
No, I want them. We'll hang them
in the freezer with the meat. How's that?

252
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,989
For us, to live any other way was nuts.

253
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:59,410
To us, those goody-good people who
worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks...

254
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:03,498
and took the subway to work every day
and worried about bills, were dead.

255
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,584
They were suckers. They had no balls.

256
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,253
If we wanted something, we just took it.

257
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:13,883
If anyone complained twice, they got hit
so bad they never complained again.

258
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:17,553
It was just all routine.
You didn't even think about it.

259
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,184
Frankie, what the fuck does 520
have to do with 469?

260
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,727
I can't believe this guy.

261
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,856
520 ain't even close to 469.
What's that got to do with anything?

262
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,861
Piece of cake. It's all there.

263
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:37,323
Don't worry about the alarms.
I just gotta find a way to get the key.

264
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,951
-No problem, right?
-I'll take care of it.

265
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,920
-Tell him what you were telling me.
-Too good to be true.

266
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,591
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money coming in.

267
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,262
Tourists and American servicemen
change their money...

268
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,514
into French money and send it back here.

269
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,599
-Shh. Calm down.
-It's beautiful.

270
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,270
It's totally untraceable. Okay?

271
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:10,106
The only problem is getting a key,
but I've got a plan.

272
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,651
-Me and Frenchy and this citizen.
-Yeah, he's a piece of work.

273
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,697
If I'm right, there could be
$500,000 coming in, all cash.

274
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,618
The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday night.

275
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,704
There's a Jewish holiday on Monday.

276
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,248
They won't find out until Tuesday.
Beautiful.

277
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,292
What about the security?

278
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,585
Security?

279
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,005
You're looking at it. It's a joke.
I'm the midnight-to-eight man.

280
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,631
I'm the commandant.

281
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,509
He just comes in
like he's picking up lost baggage.

282
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,304
-It's beautiful.
-It won't be a problem at all.

283
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,097
-Good.
-We're on.

284
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:47,685
What's really funny is
that fucking bank job in Secaucus.

285
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,937
I'm in the middle of the weeds,
lying down.

286
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,315
He says, "What are you doing?"
I said, "I'm resting."

287
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:55,776
"Here? This ain't no beach or park."
I said, "I'm resting."

288
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,403
I know I'm resting.

289
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,865
He pulls me in, starts asking questions.
You know, this and that.

290
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,951
"What are you going to tell us?"
I said, "My usual. Nothing."

291
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:08,497
"Why tell you?" The fuck. He says,
"No, you'll tell me something today."

292
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,125
I said, "Okay, go fuck your mother."

293
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,129
Bing! Pow! Boom! Bing!

294
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,758
You saw the paper, Anthony.
My head was out like this.

295
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,929
Now I'm coming around,
and who do I see in front of me?

296
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:26,766
This prick again. He says,
"What do you want to tell me now?"

297
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,895
I said, "What are you doing here?
I told you to go fuck your mother."

298
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:34,023
I thought he was gonna shit.

299
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,275
Pow! Bing! Boom!

300
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,153
The fuckers. I wish I was big just once.

301
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,493
Funny. You're really funny.

302
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,663
What do you mean, I'm funny?

303
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,083
It's funny, you know. It's a good story.

304
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,960
You're a funny guy.

305
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,088
You mean the way I talk? What?

306
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,716
It's just, you know. You're just funny.

307
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,053
You know, the way
you tell the story and everything.

308
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,681
Funny how? What's funny about it?

309
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,184
- Tommy, you got it all wrong.
- Whoa, whoa, Anthony.

310
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,853
He's a big boy. He knows what he said.
What did you say?

311
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,313
Funny, how?

312
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,026
Just, you know. You're funny.

313
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,362
Let me understand this.

314
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,572
Maybe I'm a little fucked up.

315
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,076
But, I'm funny, how? Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?

316
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,413
I make you laugh?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?

317
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,249
What do you mean, funny?
How am I funny?

318
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,046
You know, how you tell a story.

319
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:43,050
No, I don't know. You said it.
How do I know? You said I'm funny.

320
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:46,637
How the fuck am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?

321
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,556
Tell me what's funny.

322
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,105
Get the fuck out of here, Tommy.

323
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,983
Motherfucker! I almost had him!

324
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,778
You stuttering prick, you!

325
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,613
Frankie, was he shaking?

326
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:09,493
I wonder about you sometimes, Henry.
You may fold under questioning.

327
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,166
Jesus Christ.

328
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,961
What the fuck is it with you?
I thought I was getting pinched already.

329
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,465
He's hanging on my fucking neck
like a vulture. What do you want?

330
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,885
This guy didn't want to come
and give you the check.

331
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,970
Could you take care of this?

332
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,931
No problem. Tell him to put it
on my tab. Of course.

333
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,059
That's what I want to talk to you about.

334
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:36,604
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.

335
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,608
$7,000, that ain't peanuts.
I don't mean to be out of order--

336
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,777
Don't mean to be out of order?

337
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,112
It's good you don't mean
to be out of order.

338
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,949
Embarrassing me in front of my friends,
like I'm a deadbeat.

339
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,951
You know, Sonny, you're a fucking mutt.

340
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,120
You know the money
we spend in this fucking--

341
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,539
-Don't be like that.
-What do you mean?

342
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,466
Do you believe this prick?
You think this is funny?

343
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:12,139
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fucking moron!

344
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,892
You don't want to bring the check?

345
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,562
Do you believe this prick?

346
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:24,151
You're supposed
to be doing this stuff, too.

347
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,986
You're a funny guy.

348
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,031
-That's it, Henry.
-No, go back.

349
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:34,870
You want to laugh? This prick last week
asked me to christen his kid.

350
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,790
I charged him $7,000.

351
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,837
You really are a funny guy.

352
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,635
I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds
of fucking bad things.

353
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,054
He's treating me like I'm a fucking fag.

354
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:55,683
I got to go on the lam
in order to get away from this guy.

355
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,853
This ain't right. I can't go here,
I can't go there.

356
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,606
You think you're the only one?
I talk to them, they don't listen.

357
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:06,444
If you tell him, he'll stop.
I'll wind up being declared an MIA.

358
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,697
They'll find me in the back of a car
somewhere in the weeds.

359
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,324
You've known this Tommy all your life.
Who knows better?

360
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,993
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.

361
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:17,913
When I leave my house, before I get
to the car I look over both shoulders.

362
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,374
This is no way to live.
I'm no fence jumper.

363
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,877
I'm around you all my life,
tell me what I gotta do.

364
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,838
-Whatever I got to do, I'm gonna do.
-What could I do?

365
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:30,092
If there was something I could do, I would.
I would like to help you out.

366
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,928
Sonny, tell him what we talked about.

367
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,306
- You think it's all right?
- Yeah.

368
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:41,729
Maybe you could come in with me,
take a piece of this joint. It'd be good.

369
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,857
What are you talking about?
You mean the restaurant?

370
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,735
It's a classy place. Look at the layout.

371
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,988
You've been in here a million times.
You know how it looks.

372
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,909
Tommy taking over this joint
is like putting a silk hat on a pig.

373
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:58,078
I don't mean no disrespect,
but that's the way it is.

374
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:01,665
I know you're his friend.
I'm begging you. What can I say?

375
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,294
What am I gonna do?
What do you want from me?

376
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:09,256
I don't know anything
about the restaurant business. Nothing.

377
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:12,843
All I know is to sit down and order a meal,
not how to make a restaurant.

378
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,262
Not for you. It's just a place to hang.

379
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:19,099
The chef is great. The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.

380
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:22,269
I'd love to help you, but what do you want
from me? What'll I do?

381
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:25,689
Tommy's a bad kid, a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do? Shoot him?

382
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,816
That wouldn't be a bad idea.

383
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:37,284
I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean it.
I just mean that he's scaring me.

384
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,912
I just need help. Help me, please.

385
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,082
You know anything about
this restaurant business?

386
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,126
He knows everything.
He's there 24 hours a day.

387
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,963
Another fucking few minutes,
he could be a stool.

388
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,673
That's how often he's in there.

389
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,760
You want me to be your partner?
Is that what you're telling me?

390
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:58,222
What the fuck you think I'm talking about?
Paulie, please. Come on.

391
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,391
It's not even fair.

392
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,142
You don't understand.

393
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,771
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you, all right.

394
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:10,025
God bless you, Paulie. I appreciate it.
You've always been fair with me.

395
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:14,071
Now the guy's got Paulie as a
partner. Any problems, he goes to Paulie.

396
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,490
Trouble with a bill, he can go to Paulie.

397
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,659
Trouble with the cops,
deliveries, Tommy...

398
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,119
he can call Paulie.

399
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:23,080
Now the guy's gotta come up
with Paulie's money every week...

400
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,331
no matter what.

401
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:28,544
"Business is bad? Fuck you, pay me.
Had a fire? Fuck you, pay me.

402
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,505
"The place got hit by lightning?
Fuck you, pay me."

403
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,841
Can I get one of those TVs?

404
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,676
Also, Paulie could do anything.

405
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,887
Especially run up bills on the joint's credit.
And why not?

406
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,015
Nobody's gonna pay for it anyway.

407
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,183
When deliveries are made
at the front door...

408
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:46,020
you move the stuff out the back
and sell it at a discount.

409
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:49,481
You take a $200 case of booze
and sell it for $100.

410
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:52,192
It doesn't matter. It's all profit.

411
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,530
Then finally, when there's nothing left...

412
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,740
Fucking shame.

413
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:02,036
...when you can't borrow another buck
or buy another case of booze...

414
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,872
you bust the joint out. You light a match.

415
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,540
Do you need help reaching anything?

416
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,043
You look like
you're decorating a Christmas tree.

417
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,420
You don't know what you're doing.

418
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,216
She's from the Five Towns.

419
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:17,968
Who?

420
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,597
The Jew broad, Diane,
I was telling you I'm going to shag.

421
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,975
I've been trying to bang her
for a fucking month now.

422
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,436
She won't go out with me alone.

423
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,647
-No.
-No, what?

424
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,900
No, what? Who the fuck
asked you anything?

425
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,027
I didn't ask you.
Hear what I'm going to say.

426
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,737
All right, what?

427
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,697
Okay, what.

428
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,367
She don't want to go out
with Italians alone.

429
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,744
She's prejudiced against Italians.

430
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,080
You fucking believe that?
In this day and age?

431
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,957
What the fuck is this world coming to?

432
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,962
I can't believe this. A Jew broad,
prejudiced against Italians.

433
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,257
She won't go out with me alone
unless her girlfriend comes with us.

434
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,426
So you come along,
go out with her girlfriend.

435
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,470
See? I knew it.

436
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,889
You knew what?
What the fuck is wrong with that?

437
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,100
-When is this?
-Tomorrow night.

438
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,768
I can't, I gotta meet Tuddy.

439
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,688
You could meet Tuddy.
You can come early and then still go.

440
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,065
-Why do you always do this?
-Don't give me that shit.

441
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,818
What did I ask you for?
I'm asking you for a favor.

442
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,778
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.

443
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,823
I'm trying to bang this fucking broad.
Help me out.

444
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,077
I don't understand you. She's beautiful!

445
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,288
Her fucking family lives in the Five Towns.
These Jews got money.

446
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:32,835
Maybe the family owns the whole block.
You may wind up with a big score.

447
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,046
You with your fucking mouth.

448
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,469
I had a meeting with Tuddy at 11:00...

449
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,888
and here I am, a backup guy for Tommy.

450
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,641
How about it?
Did you have enough to eat?

451
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,310
It was delicious. I'm just watching my diet.

452
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,812
Let me watch your figure.

453
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,522
I couldn't wait to get away.

454
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,275
I was ordering the dessert
when they were eating dinner.

455
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,902
When they were having coffee,
I was asking for a check.

456
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,279
I had business.

457
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,948
Have some coffee. It'll wake you up.

458
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,035
- Can we have the check?
- What are you doing?

459
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,663
- I got to go.
- We just got here.

460
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,665
I got that thing. I gotta go.

461
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,001
Wait a couple of minutes.
We'll leave together.

462
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,963
This way we don't go out
like a bunch of hobos, one at a time.

463
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,340
I couldn't stand him.

464
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,843
I thought he was really obnoxious.

465
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,053
He kept fidgeting around.

466
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:29,016
You don't mind, do you?
That's very annoying.

467
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,773
Good? You might prefer Manischewitz,
but it'd look funny on my table.

468
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,068
-Ready?
-Henry, lighten up.

469
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,488
We just got here. What are you doing?

470
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:46,950
Before it was time to go home,
he was pushing me into the car...

471
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:50,370
then pulling me out. It was ridiculous.

472
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,207
Diane and Tommy made us promise...

473
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,250
to meet them again on Friday night.

474
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,585
We agreed.

475
00:29:56,753 --> 00:30:00,422
Of course, when Friday night came around,
Henry stood me up.

476
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,383
I feel terrible. I don't know where he is.

477
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,929
He really liked you, too.
All he did was talk about her.

478
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,556
We were a trio
instead of a double date that night.

479
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:12,601
He would have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.

480
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,437
But I made Tommy take me
looking for him.

481
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,568
Tommy, what the fuck?

482
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:24,530
You got some nerve standing me up.

483
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,073
Nobody does that to me.

484
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,952
Who do you think you are,
Frankie Valli or some kind of big shot?

485
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:34,081
Slow down, I forgot.
I thought it was next week.

486
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,417
It was this Friday and you agreed,
so you're a liar!

487
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,128
We can talk about this. Take it easy.

488
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,922
Talk about it?

489
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,758
Talk to you after what
you just did to me? Forget it.

490
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:49,388
I thought you would stand me up.
You looked bored. You didn't say anything.

491
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,598
What do you expect? Mm?

492
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,810
Let me make it up to you.

493
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,270
I'll think about it.

494
00:30:56,437 --> 00:31:00,065
I remember, she was screaming
on the street, and I mean loud.

495
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,400
But she looked good.

496
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,778
I'll think about it.
But it'll cost you, Hill. A lot.

497
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,573
She had these great eyes
just like Liz Taylor's.

498
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,783
At least that's what I thought.

499
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,161
-Hello, Henry.
-You ready?

500
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,788
-Yeah.
-Come on.

501
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,915
-No, wait a minute.
-What?

502
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,960
Quick, you have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that--

503
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,336
Karen.

504
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:22,880
Mom.

505
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,966
-I'd like you to meet my friend, Henry Hill.
-How do you do?

506
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,469
- Nice to meet you.
- My daughter says that you're half Jewish.

507
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,430
Um.... It's just the good half.

508
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,392
- Thank you, sir.
- Bye, see you later, thanks.

509
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,811
What're you doing?
You're leaving your car?

510
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,646
He watches the car for me.

511
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,482
It's easier than leaving it at a garage
and waiting.

512
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:46,904
It's a lot quicker that way,
you know what I mean? Huh?

513
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:56,079
I like going in this way.
It's better than waiting in line.

514
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:04,171
How are you doing? What's up?
Here you go.

515
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,429
-How are you doing?
-I'm doing all right.

516
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,764
Good.

517
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:21,772
Every time I come here,
every time, you two. Don't you work?

518
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,908
Henry, nice to see you. Hi, how are you?

519
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,119
Anthony, right in the front.

520
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,579
Anything you need, just let me know.

521
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,517
Tony, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

522
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,894
-How are you guys doing?
-How are you?

523
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:51,153
-You gave them $20 each.
-It's all right.

524
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,739
Henry, this is with Mr. Tony, over there.

525
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,198
- Where?
- Over there.

526
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,325
Thanks a lot, Tony.

527
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,956
-What do you do?
-What?

528
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,709
-What do you do?
-I'm in construction.

529
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:10,005
They don't feel like you're in construction.

530
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,590
I'm a union delegate.

531
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,885
Now, ladies and gentlemen...

532
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:19,639
the Copacabana is proud to present
the king of the one-liners...

533
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,767
Henny Youngman.

534
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:31,651
How are you all? I'm glad to be here.
Take my wife, please.

535
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,239
I take my wife everywhere
but she finds her way home.

536
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,161
I said, "Where do you
wanna go for our anniversary?"

537
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,205
She said,
"Somewhere I've never been before."

538
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,706
I said, "Try the kitchen."

539
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,959
Dr. Wellsler is here.

540
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:51,171
Gave a guy six months to live.
Couldn't pay his bill.

541
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,423
Gave him another six months.

542
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,302
I love this crowd.

543
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,652
Air France made me.

544
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,572
We walked out with $420,000
without using a gun.

545
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,326
And we did the right thing.
We gave Paulie his tribute.

546
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,541
$60,000.

547
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,876
It's going to be a good summer.

548
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:36,591
I'm proud of you.
That is a lot of money for a kid like you.

549
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:40,720
Anybody asks you where you got it,
you got it in Vegas playing craps, all right?

550
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,222
All right.

551
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,267
Check, sir.

552
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,105
No. You have to sign for it here.

553
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,567
Should I tip him?

554
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:04,202
-How are you doing?
-Okay. How are you?

555
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,373
Henry, this is Bruce. Bruce, this is Henry.

556
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,084
Good to meet you.

557
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,045
I'll see you around later.

558
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,635
-Do you know him?
-Yeah.

559
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,554
He lives across the street.

560
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:52,500
One night, Bobby Vinton sent us
champagne. There was nothing like it.

561
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:56,630
I didn't think there was
anything strange in any of this.

562
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:59,758
A 21 -year-old kid with such connections.

563
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,970
He was an exciting guy.

564
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:08,600
He was really nice.
He introduced me to everybody.

565
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,686
Everybody wanted to be nice to him.

566
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,397
He knew how to handle it.

567
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,616
Don't buy wigs that come off
at the wrong time.

568
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,118
Morrie's wigs don't come off!

569
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,578
Even underwater.

570
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:33,500
And remember, Morrie's wigs
are tested against hurricane winds.

571
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:37,212
Forget about money. You can afford
a Morrie wig. Priced to fit every budget.

572
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,838
Call me now!

573
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,592
Come in for a personalized fitting.

574
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,516
Come on, Morrie. Jimmy's waiting.
You're past due.

575
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,143
You're a good kid.
We've been good to each other.

576
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,729
But there's something
unreasonable going on here.

577
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,023
Jimmy's being a ball-breaker.

578
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,150
Give him 8-to-5 on Cleveland.

579
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:02,988
I never had to pay the vigorish
he demands. Am I something special?

580
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,823
What am I, a schmuck on wheels?

581
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,367
You know Jimmy.
You borrowed his money. Pay him.

582
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,786
I didn't agree to three points
above the vig.

583
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,455
What are you going to do?
Fight with Jimmy Conway?

584
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,791
He wants his money.
Give him his money and we'll go.

585
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,042
Fuck him!

586
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,754
Fuck him in the ear!
Fuck him in the other ear!

587
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:21,339
Did I ever bust his balls? Did I?

588
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:24,342
I could've dropped a dime a million times.

589
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,679
You're talking crazy. Stop it now, will you?

590
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,723
You got money
for that fucking commercial.

591
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,560
You don't got my money?

592
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,478
Jimmy, he's gonna pay you.

593
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,231
I'll fucking kill you.
Give me the money, cocksucker.

594
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,026
Pay me my money.

595
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,777
He'll pay.

596
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,656
Morrie's. Who's this? He's here.

597
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,701
-Jimmy, I'm sorry.
-You should be sorry.

598
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,079
Don't do it again.
Give me the fucking money!

599
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:56,207
You hear me? Give me the fucking money.

600
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:59,919
I'll give you. You've got it, kid.
You've got it, believe me.

601
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,297
Karen, slow down.

602
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,633
Where? Stay there. Don't move.

603
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,887
- What happened?
- It's Karen, Jimmy.

604
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,473
- Money today.
- I'll pay.

605
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,610
What happened?

606
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,945
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

607
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,572
Who did it?

608
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:31,993
This guy who lives across the street
from me that I've known all my life.

609
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:40,210
He started to touch me.
He started to grab me.

610
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,046
I told him to stop. He didn't stop.

611
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:47,050
I hit him back.
And then he got really angry.

612
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,388
He pushed me out of the car.

613
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,147
You sure you're all right?

614
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:07,904
Why don't you go inside
and get yourself together. Clean up.

615
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,428
What do you want, fucko?
You want something?

616
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:42,147
I swear on my fucking mother,
if you touch her again, you're dead.

617
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,275
Don't shoot.

618
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:08,423
- Hide this. Are you all right?
- Yeah.

619
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,388
I know there are women,
like my best friends...

620
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,224
who would have gotten out
the minute their boyfriend...

621
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,144
gave them a gun to hide. But I didn't.

622
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,106
I've got to admit the truth.
It turned me on.

623
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,864
Mazel tov!

624
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:09,359
Why don't you be like your friend Henry?
He's got a nice girl.

625
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,654
He's settling down now. He's married.

626
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,114
Pretty soon he'll have a nice family.

627
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:18,910
And you're still bouncing around
from girl to girl.

628
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,128
It was like he had two families.

629
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:33,591
The first time I was introduced
to all of them at once, it was crazy.

630
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:37,178
Paulie and his brothers had lots
of sons and nephews.

631
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:40,473
Almost all of them
were named Peter or Paul.

632
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,393
It was unbelievable.

633
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,980
Meet Paulie Jr., my nephew.
And this is Petey.

634
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:50,316
There must have been two dozen
Peters and Pauls at the wedding.

635
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,568
This is Marie.

636
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,571
Plus, they were all married
to girls named Marie.

637
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,699
- She looks Italian.
- She is Italian, you're right.

638
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:00,618
And they named all their daughters Marie.

639
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:05,206
And this is Pete. No, I mean Paulie.
I get confused myself.

640
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:09,294
By the time I finished meeting everybody,
I thought I was drunk.

641
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,092
Paulie, you shouldn't have.

642
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,847
Welcome to the family.

643
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,390
Sunday dinner?

644
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:25,184
So beautiful. I want to cry.

645
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,605
Here's something to help you get started.

646
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:48,958
- The bag. The bag.
- What? What bag?

647
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:52,045
The bag with the envelopes in it,
all the money.

648
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:56,382
Don't worry about that.
Nobody's going to steal that here.

649
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,373
He didn't call?

650
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:32,418
-He's with his friends.
-What kind of person doesn't call?

651
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:35,755
He's a grown-up. He doesn't have to call
every five minutes.

652
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:39,384
If he was such a grown-up
why doesn't he get you two an apartment?

653
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:42,970
Don't start. Mom, you're the one
who wanted us here.

654
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,597
You're here a month...

655
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,599
and sometimes
I know he doesn't come home at all.

656
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,726
What kind of people are these?

657
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:51,938
- What do you want me to do?
- Do? What can you do?

658
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,691
He's not Jewish.
Did you know how these people live?

659
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,359
Did you know what they were like?

660
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,612
Your father never stayed out all night
without calling.

661
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:03,074
Stay out? Daddy never
went out at all, Ma! Keep out of it.

662
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,284
You don't know how I feel!

663
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:09,539
How do you feel now? You don't know
where he is or who he's with.

664
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,958
He's with his friends! Dad!

665
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,127
Leave him out of this.
He's suffered enough.

666
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:16,087
He hasn't digested a decent meal
in six weeks.

667
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:30,101
Where were you? Why didn't you call?

668
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:34,939
We were worried to death.
A married man does not stay out like this.

669
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,569
Normal people don't act like this!

670
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,822
What's wrong with you?

671
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,076
You're not normal. She's right.
What's wrong with you?

672
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:50,413
What kind of person are you?
What is the matter with you?

673
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,207
What kind of people are they?

674
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,588
We weren't married to nine-to-five guys.

675
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,507
But the first time I realized how different...

676
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:04,051
was when Mickey had a hostess party.

677
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:07,597
-Karen, where you from?
-Lawrence.

678
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:11,851
On the Island. It's nice.
I'm from Miami. You ever been there?

679
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,688
It's okay, but it's like you died
and woke up in Jew heaven.

680
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:18,608
Angie, stop picking at that thing.

681
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,026
I'd like to smack his face.

682
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:21,778
The red-haired guy, looks like a farmer?

683
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,113
The guy's hands are all over me.

684
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:28,659
So I told him, "Keep your fucking hands
off me, or I'll cut them off."

685
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:31,662
She means it.

686
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,999
You don't know how lucky he is.
I just mention this to Vinnie....

687
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:38,795
How can you mention it?
Vinnie would kill him.

688
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:42,799
If I don't, he'll kill the miserable bastard,
then Vinnie will be there for life.

689
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,635
You think you got problems.
What about Jeannie's kid?

690
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:49,430
He was in an argument. A $10 card game.
He pulls out a gun.

691
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:53,601
The gun goes off. Some kid gets killed.
When the grandmother hears it...

692
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:57,605
and finds out he's jailed, she has a heart
attack and drops dead right on the spot.

693
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:02,193
Now Jeannie has a husband and son
in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.

694
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,780
- Jeannie drinks.
- Maybe she's depressed.

695
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,115
Give me a break. She's drunk.

696
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:12,912
As soon as something happens,
you make them out to be saints.

697
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:18,042
They had bad skin and wore too
much makeup. They didn't look very good.

698
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:21,003
They looked beat-up.
And the stuff they wore...

699
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,047
was thrown together and cheap.

700
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,883
A lot of pantsuits and double-knits.

701
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,470
She spends her life in a nightgown.

702
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:31,973
The woman is no angel, believe me.

703
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,642
They talked about their rotten kids...

704
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,478
and about beating them
with broom handles and belts.

705
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,731
And that the kids
still didn't pay any attention.

706
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,567
When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy.

707
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:45,403
I don't know if I could live like that.

708
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:49,949
God forbid, what would happen
if you had to go to prison?

709
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,200
Karen.

710
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,287
Mickey said that Jeannie's husband--

711
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:56,747
Do you know why Jeannie's husband
went to the can?

712
00:47:56,915 --> 00:48:00,084
Because of Jeannie.
He wanted to get away from her.

713
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:05,172
Let me tell you something.
Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.

714
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,300
Unless they make themselves get caught.

715
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,385
They don't have things organized.

716
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,638
I know what I'm doing.
I've got things organized with these guys.

717
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:17,393
You know who goes to jail? Nigger
stickup men. Know why they get caught?

718
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,563
Because they fall asleep
in the getaway car, Karen.

719
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,734
Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie.
Come here.

720
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:33,826
After a while, it got to be all normal.

721
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,996
None of it seemed like crime.

722
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,457
It was more like Henry was enterprising...

723
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:43,127
and that he and the guys made bucks
hustling while other guys...

724
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:46,505
were sitting on their asses
waiting for handouts.

725
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:51,260
Our husbands weren't brain surgeons,
they were blue-collar guys.

726
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:56,015
The only way they could make real extra
money was to go out and cut corners.

727
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,018
Where's the strong box, you varmint?

728
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,777
Don't fucking move! Don't move.

729
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,744
Here's your hat, you fuck.

730
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:19,914
- See you at the diner.
- I'm riding shotgun.

731
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,750
Did you see him give it right over?

732
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,586
Back to the hideout to split up the loot.

733
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,548
Yee-ha!

734
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:31,842
We were all so very close.

735
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:35,888
There were never any outsiders around.
Absolutely never.

736
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:40,726
Being together all the time made
everything seem all the more normal.

737
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:42,228
Hello, Mrs. Hill. Police.

738
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:46,691
I'm Detective Deacy. This is Detective
Silvestri. We have a search warrant.

739
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,859
Would you read and sign it?

740
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,444
- Anywhere?
- Yeah, anywhere.

741
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:53,030
This'll take a while,
we have to go through everything.

742
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:56,534
- You boys want some coffee?
- No coffee now, thanks.

743
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:00,705
- Be careful.
- We'll just go about our business.

744
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:03,249
There was always a little harassment.

745
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,210
They wanted to talk to Henry
about this or that.

746
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:09,588
They'd make me sign
their subpoenas or warrants.

747
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:12,133
But mostly they just wanted a handout.

748
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,678
A few bucks to keep things quiet
no matter what they found.

749
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:25,813
I always asked if they wanted coffee.
Some wives, like Mickey Conway...

750
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,941
used to curse at them
and spit on the floor.

751
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:32,695
She used to spit on her own floor.
That never made any sense to me.

752
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,906
It was better to be polite
and call the lawyer.

753
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,503
We always did everything together,
and we always were in the same crowd.

754
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:53,632
Anniversaries, christenings.
We only went to each other's houses.

755
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:57,053
The women played cards.

756
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:01,348
When kids were born, Mickey and Jimmy
were the first at the hospital.

757
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:04,602
When we went to the Islands
or Vegas for vacation...

758
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,020
we went together.

759
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:09,231
No outsiders ever. It got to be normal.

760
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,485
It got to where I was proud
that I had the kind of husband...

761
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:16,322
who was willing to risk his neck
just to get us the little extras.

762
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,451
But I got Mom to watch
the babies tomorrow night.

763
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,453
- Can't do it, Karen.
- Why not?

764
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,289
I just can't. I got something lined up.

765
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,709
But tomorrow's the only night
she can do it.

766
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:32,671
-Pretty please?
-I can't. What do you want me to do?

767
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,217
-I got to go.
-Wait a minute.

768
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,678
I wanted to go shopping.
Can I get some money?

769
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,555
How much do you need?

770
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,226
-How much?
-That much.

771
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:52,900
This much. Give me a kiss.

772
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,155
See you later.

773
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:03,035
Uh-oh....

774
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:04,411
All right.

775
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:38,529
Welcome home, Batts.

776
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,032
Hi, how are you?

777
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:45,828
Sit down. Have a drink.
Give them all a drink.

778
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:48,956
And give those Irish hoodlums a drink.

779
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,833
There's only one Irishman here.

780
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,210
It's a celebration, fellas.

781
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:56,422
- Top of the morning to you.
- It's good to be home.

782
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,344
This is my friend Jimmy.

783
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:05,139
Henry. It's his joint. This is Lisa.

784
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,142
Tommy. All dressed up.

785
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,270
All grown up and doing the town.
Look at this.

786
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:14,231
Forgot you were having a party
for this mug.

787
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:16,483
Come here.

788
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,944
I'll say hello. Billy, how are you?

789
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:21,947
Get over here.
I haven't seen you in six years.

790
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:25,201
Jesus Christ Almighty. You look terrific.

791
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,244
Watch the suit.

792
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:30,956
You little prick. I've known you all my life.

793
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:35,294
-Don't get too big on me.
-Just don't bust my balls.

794
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:38,464
If I was gonna break your balls,
I'd say, "Go get your shine box."

795
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,427
This kid was great.

796
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,721
They used to call him "Spitshine Tommy."

797
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:49,767
He'd make your shoes look like
fucking mirrors. Excuse my language.

798
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:54,063
He was terrific. He was the best.
He made a lot of money, too.

799
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:56,941
No more shines, Billy.

800
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:59,068
-What?
-I said no more shines.

801
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,987
You've been away a long time.
They didn't tell you.

802
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:04,281
I don't shine shoes anymore.

803
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:08,702
Relax. What's got into you?
I'm breaking your balls a little, that's all.

804
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,120
I'm only kidding with you.

805
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:13,624
Sometimes you don't sound like it.
There's a lot of people around.

806
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,918
I'm only kidding. We're having a party.

807
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:19,797
I haven't seen you in a long time
and you get fucking fresh.

808
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,924
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

809
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,468
I'm sorry, too. It's okay. No problem.

810
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,267
Now go home and get your fucking
shine box.

811
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,851
Motherfucking mutt!

812
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:35,271
You fucking piece of shit!

813
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,731
Come on, come on!

814
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:41,777
He bought his fucking button!
That fake old tough guy!

815
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,238
You bought your fucking button!

816
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:46,699
- Don't get nervous.
- You motherfucker!

817
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:49,660
Keep that motherfucker here!
Keep him here.

818
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,372
Come on, you fucking feel strong?

819
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,792
Sorry. Tommy gets a little loaded.
He doesn't mean any disrespect.

820
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,295
He doesn't mean any disrespect?
Are you nuts?

821
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:02,965
Teach this kid a little fucking manners.
What's right is right.

822
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,551
-You understand what I'm saying?
-It's all right.

823
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:10,097
We're hugging and kissing over here
and then he acts like a fucking jerk.

824
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:14,893
You insulted him a little bit.
You got a little out of order.

825
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,187
- I didn't.
- You insulted him a little.

826
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:20,774
-I didn't insult anybody. Give us a drink.
-Okay.

827
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:23,444
Let's have some drinks.
Drinks on the house.

828
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,696
No, have the drink with me.

829
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:28,866
The drinks are on the house.

830
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:33,662
I fucked kids like that in the can.
In the ass.

831
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,998
Fucking break up my party.

832
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:46,008
You've been away for six years.
It's different now.

833
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,510
I did my fucking time, Jimmy.

834
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:53,515
I came home and I want what I got to get.
I got mouths to feed.

835
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:56,352
-You're gonna get it.
-You understand?

836
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:00,814
Get the door!

837
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,998
Let me shoot him
in his big, fucking mouth!

838
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,792
Let's shoot him.

839
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,686
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.

840
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:42,481
His whole crew is going to be
looking for him.

841
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:49,196
This is bad. What do we do with him?
We can't just dump him on the street.

842
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:52,991
I know a place upstate.
They'll never find him. More tablecloths.

843
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:55,786
I didn't want to get blood on your floor.

844
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,333
Go open your trunk.

845
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,381
We'll get a shovel at my mother's house.

846
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:20,769
She has a shovel here somewhere.
Quiet, I don't want to wake her up.

847
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:25,149
Look who's here.

848
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,318
What did you do? What happened?

849
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:31,029
I hit something on the road.
Jimmy will tell you.

850
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,365
What happened to him?

851
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:38,287
I haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?

852
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,330
You, too. How are you?

853
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:41,707
Why are you up so late?

854
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:46,211
He came in. You came in.
I'm so happy to see him.

855
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:50,215
Go inside. Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll make you something to eat.

856
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:53,135
-Go to sleep. We're leaving.
-I can't. Not while he's home.

857
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,596
I haven't seen him in so long.
I want to see him.

858
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:56,972
You go inside.

859
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,474
This stuff is like lead. Ba-boom.

860
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:01,727
Tell me, where you been?
I haven't seen you.

861
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,605
You haven't called. Where have you been?

862
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:07,691
-I been working nights.
-And?

863
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,651
And tonight we were out late.

864
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:13,238
We took a ride out to the country
and hit a deer.

865
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:16,408
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.

866
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:20,245
It reminds me, I need this knife.
I'm taking this, okay?

867
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:22,247
-Okay.
-Just for a while.

868
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:23,832
The poor thing.

869
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,753
We hit the deer and his paw....
What do you call it?

870
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,546
The paw.

871
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:32,132
-The hoof.
-Got caught in the grill.

872
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,134
-I got to hack it off.
-Ooh.

873
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,553
Ma, it's a sin to leave it there.

874
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:38,597
I'll bring the knife back.

875
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:41,016
- Delicious.
- Thank you.

876
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,352
Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?

877
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,354
I do, almost every night.

878
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:48,065
But get yourself a girl
so you could settle down.

879
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:53,153
I do, every night. Then I'm free.
I love you, I want to be with you.

880
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,696
Settle down.

881
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,158
How's your friend Henry?

882
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:00,619
What's the matter? You don't talk much.

883
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,538
Talk. What are you quiet for?

884
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:05,123
You don't eat much, you don't talk much.

885
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:07,793
- I'm just listening.
- Something wrong?

886
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:11,338
When we were kids,
the compares used to visit one another.

887
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:16,468
There was this man. He would never talk.
He'd just sit there all night, not a word.

888
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:21,181
They say to him, "What's the matter?
Don't you say anything?"

889
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:25,477
He says, "What am I going to say,
that my wife two-times me?"

890
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:29,356
So she says, "Shut up!
You're always talking."

891
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:33,777
But in Italian, it sounds much nicer.

892
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,487
-Cornuto contento.
-That's it.

893
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:39,283
- What does that mean?
- It means he's content to be a jerk.

894
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:42,369
He doesn't care who knows it.

895
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,330
-Did Tommy tell you about my painting?
-No.

896
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:47,874
Look at this.

897
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:49,334
It's beautiful.

898
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:52,671
I like it. One dog goes one way
and the other goes the other.

899
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,299
One's facing east, the other west.
So what?

900
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:58,969
He's saying, "What do you want
from me?" The guy's got nice white hair.

901
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,096
Beautiful. The dog looks the same.

902
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,265
Looks like somebody we know.

903
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,144
Without the beard. It's him.

904
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:10,981
It's him.

905
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:21,825
What the fuck is that?

906
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:24,578
For most of the guys,
killings were accepted.

907
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:27,456
Murder was the only way
everybody stayed in line.

908
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:31,126
You got out of line, you got whacked.
Everybody knew the rules.

909
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:34,504
Sometimes, even if people didn't
get out of line, they got whacked.

910
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:39,092
Hits became a habit. Guys would get
into arguments over nothing.

911
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,470
Before you knew it, one was dead.

912
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,847
They were shooting each other
all the time.

913
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:47,559
Shooting people was a normal thing.
It was no big deal.

914
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:52,064
We had a serious problem with Billy Batts.

915
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:56,443
This was really a touchy thing.
Tommy killed a made guy.

916
01:00:56,611 --> 01:01:00,072
Batts was part of the Gambino crew
and was considered untouchable.

917
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:04,326
Before you touched a made guy,
you had to have a good reason.

918
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:07,245
You had to have a sit-down
and you'd better get an okay...

919
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:09,748
or you'd be the one who got whacked.

920
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,762
Saturday night was for wives...

921
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:27,099
but Friday night at the Copa
was for the girlfriends.

922
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,186
Last week, we saw Sammy Davis, Jr.

923
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:34,272
You got to see this show.
What a performer.

924
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,943
He does these impersonations.
You'd think it was the real people.

925
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:42,197
It's unbelievable. You could see
how a white girl could fall for him.

926
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:43,615
What?

927
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:48,745
Not me. But you could see how
some girls could. Like that Swedish girl.

928
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:51,081
So you condone that stuff.

929
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:52,582
Take it easy.

930
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:57,129
I don't want to be kissing
Nat King Cole over here.

931
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:58,964
No, I'm not talking about me.

932
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:02,551
But, you know, he's got personality.

933
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,177
Personality?

934
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,640
He's talented.
I understand what you're saying.

935
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:12,144
But watch what you say.
People get the wrong impression.

936
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:14,730
I just said he was talented,
you're unbelievable.

937
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:17,399
Just leave it alone now,
I understand what you said.

938
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,609
He's talented. Leave it at that.

939
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:00,460
No? Not even Uncle Paulie?

940
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,396
What did you hear about that thing?

941
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:22,941
-The Brooklyn thing?
-No, the guy from downtown.

942
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:26,945
-The guy from where Christie lived?
-No.

943
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:31,283
The guy who disappeared,
the one they made the beef on.

944
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:33,952
-Know the guy I mean?
-Yeah.

945
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:38,206
His name was Batts. His people
are driving everyone crazy looking for him.

946
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,083
Nobody knows what happened to him.

947
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:44,296
He came into the joint that night
and then just disappeared. That was it.

948
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:50,302
All right. Keep your eyes open.
They're busting my balls over it.

949
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:52,804
-All right?
-Yeah.

950
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:57,392
Okay, everybody, let's eat.

951
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,233
I want my money.

952
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,694
He owes it.

953
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,372
You know that thing
we took care of upstate?

954
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:22,876
-Paulie was talking about that.
-Got to get it out of there.

955
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:26,171
They just sold the property
to make condominiums.

956
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:30,008
-It's been six months.
-We got to get it out of there right away.

957
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:46,858
Henry, hurry up. My mother's
making fried peppers and sausage for us.

958
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:52,656
- Here's an arm.
- Very funny, guys.

959
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:54,199
Here's a leg.

960
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:55,867
Here's a wing.

961
01:05:56,577 --> 01:06:00,538
What do you like, the leg or the wing?
Or you still go for the hearts and lungs?

962
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,959
Oh, that's so bad.

963
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,464
Ah!

964
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:12,717
What happened to the car?

965
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:14,844
I hit a skunk, all right?

966
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:16,721
Go with your mother.

967
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:19,599
Ew! It's disgusting, Henry.

968
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:26,648
I set up Janice in an apartment
around the corner from The Suite.

969
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:29,442
That way I was able to stay over
a couple of nights a week.

970
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:30,860
This is my new antique lamp.

971
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:34,072
Karen was home with the kids.
She never asked questions.

972
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,074
The furniture's all Maurice Valencia.

973
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,867
Looks like Roma.

974
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:40,286
This is all silk. This is from Siam.

975
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:44,082
Come see my bedroom.

976
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:48,628
-Tommy, will you take him?
-I'll eat this fucking dog tonight.

977
01:06:52,591 --> 01:06:54,759
Love that crystal ball or what?

978
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:59,222
This is where we spend most of our time.

979
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,309
I love the floral arrangements.

980
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:06,354
French.

981
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:10,442
Janice and I were having so much
fun, she started screwing up at work.

982
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:13,069
I had to straighten out her boss
a little bit.

983
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:16,781
Janice can do what she wants to do.
Got it?

984
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:21,327
Just try to run. Hang up once more,
and you'll deal with me.

985
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:29,127
Come on, get off of her.

986
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:31,171
You're an animal.

987
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:47,896
Spider, on your way over here,
bring me a Cutty and water.

988
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:52,650
- Did you guys eat?
- I'm starving.

989
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:56,154
- I'll play these.
- You'll play those?

990
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:58,323
Do I stutter? I play those.

991
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:04,329
What am I? A mirage?

992
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,290
Where's my fucking drink?
I asked you for a drink.

993
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:10,043
- You wanted a drink?
- I asked you for one.

994
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:13,129
I thought you said, "I'm all right, Spider."

995
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,840
Am I on a pay-no-mind list?

996
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:20,220
No, I heard someone say "Spider, Spider."

997
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:23,848
-I thought it was Henry.
-You're a mumbling, stuttering little fuck.

998
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:25,934
I thought you said, "I'm all right, Spider."

999
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,769
You ain't all right.

1000
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,105
No, I thought you said you were all right.

1001
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:33,191
I am all right! You ain't, you prick.

1002
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:38,196
You've been doing this all fucking night
to me, you motherfucker!

1003
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:40,740
He wants a drink now? I'll bring it.

1004
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:43,535
Go get me a fucking drink!
Move it, you little prick.

1005
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:46,287
You walk like fucking Stepin Fetchit.

1006
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,039
For everybody else you run.

1007
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:52,210
Run for me, you prick!
Dance, dance the fucking drink back here!

1008
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:54,129
What's that movie that Bogart made?

1009
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:57,006
-Where he played a cowboy.
-The Oklahoma Kid.

1010
01:08:57,174 --> 01:09:01,136
-Shane?
-Oklahoma Kid, that's me!

1011
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:03,888
You fucking varmint. Dance!

1012
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:06,057
Yahoo, you motherfucker!

1013
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,726
Round up those fucking wagons.

1014
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:16,442
Now he's moving.

1015
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,904
- Henry, what happened?
- He shot him in the foot, Tommy.

1016
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:24,409
He's fucking fine. So he got shot
in the foot. What is it? A big fucking deal?

1017
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:27,120
-Get a towel.
-Nice fucking game.

1018
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:33,376
Take him to Ben Casey, the little prick.
Let him crawl like he crawls for the drinks.

1019
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:36,588
Take him to the doctor down the street.

1020
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,756
Bones are all shattered.

1021
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:40,717
Don't get me upset, now.

1022
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:44,429
Don't make a big fucking thing out of it,
Spider, you little prick.

1023
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:47,265
You trying to make me think
what the fuck I did here.

1024
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,142
It was an accident.

1025
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:51,853
-Little fucking actor.
-I got a great hand here.

1026
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,438
-You in or out?
-Yeah, I'm in.

1027
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:55,481
-$800.
-$800?

1028
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:59,861
You haven't been home in
two weeks. You're not going out tonight!

1029
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:03,615
Karen, will you grow up! Stop!
I'm still gonna go out!

1030
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:05,658
Not without your car keys, you're not.

1031
01:10:05,826 --> 01:10:07,827
Are you nuts? What's your problem?

1032
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:10,205
Yes, I'm nuts. Something's going on.

1033
01:10:10,414 --> 01:10:13,291
-Stop with that. Enough! Stop with that.
-No!

1034
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:17,170
I'm telling you, I look in your face
and I know that you're lying!

1035
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:21,591
-Get out! Get out!
-Shut up.

1036
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:22,926
Get out of my life!

1037
01:10:23,093 --> 01:10:26,054
You're fucked in the head, Karen.
This is all in your mind.

1038
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:28,556
-You're a lousy bastard!
-You got a problem.

1039
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:32,352
Go ahead, go to your ready-made whores.
That's all you're good for!

1040
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:36,231
Get out of my life! I can't stand you!

1041
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:48,826
Spider, what's your rush?

1042
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:53,081
-Here you go.
-Thank you, Spider.

1043
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:57,502
Spider, that fucking bandage on your foot
is bigger than your fucking head.

1044
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:03,591
Next thing you know, he's gonna be
coming in one of these fucking walkers.

1045
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:05,510
Even though you got that, you can dance?

1046
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:10,223
Give us a couple of fucking steps, Spider.
You fucking bullshitter, you.

1047
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:12,725
Tell the truth.
You're looking for sympathy?

1048
01:11:12,893 --> 01:11:15,186
Why don't you go fuck yourself, Tommy?

1049
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,815
Whoa!

1050
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:22,360
I didn't fucking hear right.
Can't believe what I heard.

1051
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:25,029
Spider, here. This is for you. Attaboy.

1052
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:28,825
I got respect for this kid.
He's got a lot of fucking balls.

1053
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:31,452
Good for you.
Don't take no shit off nobody.

1054
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:35,456
He shoots him in the foot,
he tells him to go fuck himself.

1055
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:40,336
Are you gonna let this fucking punk
get away with that?

1056
01:11:40,504 --> 01:11:42,839
What's the matter?
What's the world coming to?

1057
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,721
That's what the fucking world
is coming to. How do you like that?

1058
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:53,057
-How's that, all right?
-What's the fucking matter with you?

1059
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:55,393
What are you, stupid or what?

1060
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:58,688
Tommy, I'm kidding with you.
Are you a fucking sick maniac?

1061
01:11:58,856 --> 01:12:01,816
How do I know if you're kidding?
You're breaking my fucking balls?

1062
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:04,485
I'm fucking kidding with you,
you fucking shoot the guy?

1063
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:05,862
He's dead.

1064
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:09,657
Good shot. What do you want from me?
Good shot.

1065
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:11,409
You can't miss at this distance.

1066
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:13,369
You got a problem
with what I did, Anthony?

1067
01:12:13,537 --> 01:12:14,579
No.

1068
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:18,458
Fucking rat. His whole family's
all rats. He would've grown up to be a rat.

1069
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:20,793
Stupid bastard! I can't fucking believe you.

1070
01:12:20,961 --> 01:12:24,839
Now you're going to dig the hole.
I got no fucking lime.

1071
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:29,177
I'll dig the hole. I don't give a fuck.
Is it the first hole I dug?

1072
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:32,305
I'll dig the fucking hole.
Where are the shovels?

1073
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:34,849
- Hello.
- Hello?

1074
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:37,310
This is Karen Hill. I wanna talk to you.

1075
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:41,564
Hello? Don't hang up on me!

1076
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:43,441
I want to talk to you!

1077
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:45,651
You keep away from my husband,
you hear me?

1078
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,281
Hello? Open the door!

1079
01:12:52,242 --> 01:12:53,368
Answer me!

1080
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:56,537
I'm gonna tell everyone
who walks in this building...

1081
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:59,540
that in 2R, Rossi,
you are nothing but a whore!

1082
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:01,084
Is this the superintendent?

1083
01:13:01,251 --> 01:13:03,753
Yes, I want you to know, sir,
that you have a whore...

1084
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:05,213
living in 2R!

1085
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:08,549
Rossi, Janice Rossi. Do you hear me?

1086
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:10,718
He's my husband!

1087
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:13,596
Get your own goddamn man!

1088
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:16,349
Wake up, Henry.

1089
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:27,151
Karen....

1090
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:31,489
What are you doing?

1091
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:37,036
-Karen, are you crazy?
-I am crazy.

1092
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:40,957
I'm crazy enough to kill both of you.

1093
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:45,628
Karen, take it easy.

1094
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:51,092
-Okay?
-Do you love her?

1095
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:53,761
Do you?

1096
01:13:54,888 --> 01:13:56,973
-Do you?
-Karen...

1097
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:01,644
I love you. You know I love you.

1098
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:04,564
You don't.

1099
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,817
No, you don't.

1100
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:11,154
Please, be careful. Baby, don't.

1101
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:15,241
But still I couldn't hurt him.
How could I hurt him?

1102
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:17,910
I couldn't even bring myself to leave him.

1103
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:19,787
The truth was...

1104
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:22,165
that no matter how bad I felt...

1105
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:25,376
I was still very attracted to him.

1106
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:28,880
Why should I give him to someone else?

1107
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:30,882
Why should she win?

1108
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:36,471
Just put it down.

1109
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:40,057
You know I love you, don't you?

1110
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:42,310
You're all I want, Karen.

1111
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:46,022
Please put the gun down, Karen.

1112
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:49,567
Baby, come on.

1113
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:54,405
Shh.

1114
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:57,909
Shh.

1115
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:05,875
What are you, fucking crazy, Karen?

1116
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:10,046
I got enough to worry about
getting whacked on the street!

1117
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:13,883
I got to fucking come home for this?

1118
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:16,427
I should fucking kill you!

1119
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:19,555
How does it feel?

1120
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:22,558
How does it feel, Karen?

1121
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:41,118
I'm sorry!

1122
01:15:48,126 --> 01:15:50,086
Hi, Jimmy! How are you?

1123
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:53,965
- Looking good.
- Thank you. Good to see you.

1124
01:15:54,132 --> 01:15:56,592
-Hi, Paulie!
-Hi, honey. How are you?

1125
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,802
Good.

1126
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:00,596
-Why don't you go get cigarettes, okay?
-Sure.

1127
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:03,933
-Any of you need anything?
-I'm all right.

1128
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:07,144
- Want anything to drink? A beer?
- No.

1129
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:09,897
- Chinese food?
- No, come on, sit down.

1130
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:20,408
Karen came to the house.
She's very upset.

1131
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:22,743
You gotta straighten this thing out.

1132
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:26,247
We got to have calm now. We don't know
what the hell she's gonna do.

1133
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,499
She's getting all hysterical.
She gets very excited.

1134
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:32,712
She's wild. And you got to take it easy.
You got children.

1135
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:37,008
I'm not saying you gotta go back to her
this minute, but you gotta go back.

1136
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:39,677
It's the only way.
You gotta keep up appearances.

1137
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:42,263
The two of them
come over every day, commiserating.

1138
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,432
I can't have it.

1139
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,935
I can't do it, Henry.

1140
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:50,938
Nobody says that you can't do
what you wanna do.

1141
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:53,983
We all know that. I mean, this is what it is.

1142
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:56,902
We know what it is.
You have to do the right thing.

1143
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:59,155
You have to go home to the family,
you understand?

1144
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:02,199
You got to go home, okay? Look at me.

1145
01:17:02,492 --> 01:17:04,702
You gotta go home. Smarten up.

1146
01:17:05,412 --> 01:17:06,954
- All right?
- All right.

1147
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:08,664
I'm gonna talk to Karen.

1148
01:17:08,832 --> 01:17:12,376
I'll straighten this out.
I know just what to say to her.

1149
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:14,879
I'm gonna tell her you'll go back to her...

1150
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:17,923
and it'll be just the way
it was when you were first married...

1151
01:17:18,091 --> 01:17:19,800
your romance, it's gonna be beautiful.

1152
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:22,136
I know how to talk to her,
especially to her.

1153
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:24,764
Jimmy and Tommy are going down
to Tampa this weekend...

1154
01:17:24,931 --> 01:17:26,057
to pick up something for me.

1155
01:17:26,224 --> 01:17:27,725
Instead, you go with Jimmy.

1156
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:29,393
You come with me, we'll go down.

1157
01:17:29,561 --> 01:17:32,063
Have a good time.
Take some time for yourself. Relax.

1158
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:34,065
Sit in the sun. Take a couple days off.

1159
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:36,067
-We'll have a good time.
-Enjoy yourselves.

1160
01:17:36,234 --> 01:17:39,362
And when you come back,
you go back to Karen. Huh?

1161
01:17:39,529 --> 01:17:41,238
Please, there's no other way.

1162
01:17:41,406 --> 01:17:44,033
You're not gonna get a divorce.
We're not animali.

1163
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:46,744
No divorce. She'll never divorce him.

1164
01:17:48,538 --> 01:17:51,415
She'll kill him, but she won't divorce him.

1165
01:17:55,754 --> 01:17:57,421
You gonna pay us?

1166
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:06,806
-You gonna pay?
-Give us the fucking money!

1167
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:09,392
I can't, I swear.

1168
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:12,228
Let's go.

1169
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:23,447
- We'll throw the bastard to the lions.
- No!

1170
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:26,325
What fucking lions?
I ain't going near any lions, Jimmy!

1171
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:28,828
- Let's throw him over the moat.
- All right.

1172
01:18:28,995 --> 01:18:30,371
I'll get the money!

1173
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,165
They must really feed each other
to the lions down there...

1174
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:35,084
because the guy gave the money right up.

1175
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:36,919
I swear to Christ, I'll get the money.

1176
01:18:37,087 --> 01:18:39,213
We got to spend the rest of the weekend
at the track.

1177
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:40,923
Yeah. They mean business.

1178
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:43,718
Then, I couldn't believe what happened.

1179
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:46,762
When we got home,
we were all over the newspaper.

1180
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:50,015
At first, I didn't even know
why we got picked up.

1181
01:18:50,183 --> 01:18:52,309
Then I found out
that the guy we roughed up...

1182
01:18:52,477 --> 01:18:55,855
turned out to have a sister
working as a typist for the FBI.

1183
01:18:56,022 --> 01:18:58,899
Who could believe it?
Of all the fucking people.

1184
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:02,278
She gave up everybody:
Jimmy, me, even her brother.

1185
01:19:03,655 --> 01:19:06,532
It took the jury six hours
to bring us in guilty.

1186
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,952
The judge gave Jimmy and me 10 years
like he was giving away candy.

1187
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,788
...ten years in a federal penitentiary.

1188
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:15,958
You will now be turned over to
the United States Attorney General's Office.

1189
01:19:21,339 --> 01:19:22,965
Toast, guys.

1190
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:25,676
Good trip, good life, get out soon.

1191
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:27,511
Good trip, sweetheart.

1192
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:32,516
We'll watch the home front.

1193
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:36,479
Say hello to those blow-job hacks.

1194
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:40,691
Yeah, motherfuck them
every chance you get.

1195
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:49,074
I'll call you when I get a chance.

1196
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:02,797
Now take me to jail.

1197
01:20:07,427 --> 01:20:10,221
In prison, dinner was always a big thing.

1198
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:14,099
We had a pasta course,
and then we had a meat or a fish.

1199
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:17,561
Paulie did the prep work.
He was doing a year for contempt...

1200
01:20:17,729 --> 01:20:20,064
and had this wonderful system
for doing the garlic.

1201
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:23,234
He used a razor,
and he used to slice it so thin...

1202
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:26,195
that it used to liquefy in the pan
with just a little oil.

1203
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:28,322
It was a very good system.

1204
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,991
Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.

1205
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:32,576
Get the smell?

1206
01:20:32,744 --> 01:20:35,454
Three kinds of meat in the meatballs:

1207
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:37,665
veal, beef, and pork.

1208
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:40,125
Good, but you gotta have the pork.

1209
01:20:40,293 --> 01:20:41,836
That's the flavor.

1210
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:45,464
I felt he used too many onions,
but it was still a very good sauce.

1211
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:48,425
Vinnie, don't put too many onions
in the sauce.

1212
01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:51,178
I didn't put too much onions in, Paul.

1213
01:20:51,471 --> 01:20:53,264
Put three small onions, that's all I did.

1214
01:20:53,431 --> 01:20:55,975
Three onions? How many cans
of tomatoes you put in there?

1215
01:20:56,142 --> 01:20:58,894
- I put two big cans.
- You don't need three onions.

1216
01:20:59,062 --> 01:21:01,063
Johnny Dio did the meat.

1217
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:03,816
We had no broiler,
so Johnny did everything in pans.

1218
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:06,110
It used to smell up the joint
something awful...

1219
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:09,238
and the hacks used to die,
but he still cooked a great steak.

1220
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:11,949
- How do you like yours?
- Medium rare.

1221
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:14,660
Medium rare. An aristocrat.

1222
01:21:15,078 --> 01:21:18,831
You know, when you think
of prison you get pictures in your mind...

1223
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:22,626
of all those old movies
with rows of guys behind bars.

1224
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:24,712
It wasn't like that for wiseguys.

1225
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,548
It really wasn't that bad,
excepting that I missed Jimmy...

1226
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:29,133
who was doing his time in Atlanta.

1227
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:31,802
Give me two steaks
while you're in there, all right?

1228
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:37,600
Everyone else in the joint was doing
real time, mixed together, living like pigs.

1229
01:21:37,767 --> 01:21:40,769
But we lived alone. We owned the joint.

1230
01:21:40,937 --> 01:21:44,315
We batted them sons of bitches.
You couldn't recognize them.

1231
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:45,816
Good, they deserved it.

1232
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:49,278
Even the hacks we couldn't bribe
would never rat on the guys we did.

1233
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:51,405
...had respect. People loved one another.

1234
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:53,782
-They left their doors open.
-Sorry it took so long.

1235
01:21:53,950 --> 01:21:56,452
The skinny guard's getting to be
a real pain in the ass.

1236
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:59,830
-We're gonna have to do something.
-I took care of him.

1237
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:01,707
What'd you bring?

1238
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:04,001
-Bread.
-Good. Fresh.

1239
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:06,086
Vinnie, I got your peppers and onions.

1240
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:08,422
Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese.

1241
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:10,090
Come on, what else?

1242
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:11,759
- Scotch.
- Nice.

1243
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,595
-Some red wine.
-Okay.

1244
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,805
-Now we can eat.
-I got some white, too.

1245
01:22:16,973 --> 01:22:18,724
Give me the white, too. Beautiful.

1246
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:21,894
Okay, boys, let's eat.
Come on, it's ready, Vinnie.

1247
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:23,812
Some more bread.

1248
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:26,398
Tomorrow we eat sandwiches.
You got to go on a diet, Vinnie.

1249
01:22:26,566 --> 01:22:28,651
-You must be kidding.
-Believe me.

1250
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:39,328
What are you doing?

1251
01:22:44,668 --> 01:22:46,543
I'll take that.

1252
01:22:48,922 --> 01:22:51,382
-All right, I'll catch you guys later.
-Yeah.

1253
01:22:51,549 --> 01:22:53,884
You going for a walk in the park?

1254
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:58,555
-Okay, I'll catch you next week. Thanks.
-Okay.

1255
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:03,936
-Is there any more?
-No, that's it. Have a good weekend.

1256
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:05,312
-Thanks.
-You too, Henry.

1257
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:15,155
Mrs. Hill, come here.

1258
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:16,490
Come on.

1259
01:23:19,869 --> 01:23:21,912
You girls stay right here.

1260
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:25,582
-I want you to hold hands.
-Okay, go right up to the front.

1261
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:27,835
- Let's go.
- How you doing?

1262
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:30,212
- Good, how are you?
- Very well, thank you.

1263
01:23:42,475 --> 01:23:44,935
-What you talking about?
-I saw her name in the register.

1264
01:23:45,103 --> 01:23:47,271
- Jesus Christ.
- You want her to visit you?

1265
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:51,108
Let her stay up all night crying
and writing letters to the parole board.

1266
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:54,445
What am I doing here?
Where am I? I'm in jail.

1267
01:23:54,612 --> 01:23:56,739
I can't stop people
from coming to see me.

1268
01:23:56,906 --> 01:24:00,284
Good, let her sneak this stuff in
for you every week.

1269
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:04,079
-Let her fight these bastards every week!
-Look what you're doing! Stop it!

1270
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:07,791
- Shh.
- I'm sorry.

1271
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:10,753
Let her sneak this shit in for you.

1272
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:13,630
Will you stop it, Karen?

1273
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:16,633
-Let her do it!
-Stop it!

1274
01:24:24,809 --> 01:24:28,103
Nobody's helping me. I'm all alone.

1275
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:31,148
Belle and Morrie are broke.

1276
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:34,777
I asked your friend Remo
for the money that he owes you.

1277
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:36,320
You know what he told me?

1278
01:24:36,488 --> 01:24:40,074
He told me to take my kids down
to the police station and get on welfare.

1279
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:42,201
It's gonna be okay.

1280
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:46,497
Even Paulie, since he got out, I've never
seen him. I never see anybody anymore.

1281
01:24:46,664 --> 01:24:49,458
It's only you and me.
That's what happens when you go away.

1282
01:24:49,626 --> 01:24:53,629
I told you that we're on our own.
Forget everybody else. Forget Paulie.

1283
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:58,634
As long as he's on parole,
he doesn't want anybody doing anything.

1284
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:03,347
-I can't do it.
-Yes, you can. Listen to me.

1285
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:06,100
All I need for you
is to keep bringing me the stuff.

1286
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:08,852
I got a guy in here from Pittsburgh
who'll help me move it.

1287
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:10,646
In a month we're gonna be fine.

1288
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:13,148
-We won't need anybody.
-I'm afraid.

1289
01:25:13,316 --> 01:25:15,234
I'm afraid if Paulie finds out....

1290
01:25:15,401 --> 01:25:16,819
Don't worry about him.

1291
01:25:16,986 --> 01:25:20,531
He is not helping us out.
Is he putting any food on the table?

1292
01:25:21,699 --> 01:25:23,158
We've gotta help each other.

1293
01:25:23,326 --> 01:25:26,995
We've just gotta be really careful
while we do it.

1294
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:33,877
I don't want to hear a word
about her anymore.

1295
01:25:34,045 --> 01:25:35,087
Never.

1296
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:02,114
Daddy!

1297
01:26:03,741 --> 01:26:05,993
- We missed you.
- Are you here to stay?

1298
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:09,746
Did you see our pictures?
I did the one with the house and rainbow.

1299
01:26:09,914 --> 01:26:11,331
I did the sun.

1300
01:26:11,499 --> 01:26:15,419
My chorus concert is in two weeks.
Are you coming?

1301
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:18,088
Do you like the house?

1302
01:26:19,382 --> 01:26:21,258
Karen, get packed.
We're moving out of here.

1303
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:22,634
With what?

1304
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:25,929
Don't worry, with what.
Just start looking for a new house.

1305
01:26:26,097 --> 01:26:29,516
I got to go to Pittsburgh in the morning.
Those guys there owe me $15,000.

1306
01:26:29,684 --> 01:26:31,602
We'll be all right. I got things lined up.

1307
01:26:31,769 --> 01:26:34,438
Pittsburgh? You have to go see
your parole officer tomorrow.

1308
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:37,524
Don't worry about it.
Everything's gonna be fine.

1309
01:26:38,234 --> 01:26:40,360
- Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?
- Me!

1310
01:26:50,914 --> 01:26:52,497
What do you want?

1311
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:54,791
Sweetheart, let Mommy eat.

1312
01:26:58,254 --> 01:27:01,131
You look good.
Did you eat this good in the joint?

1313
01:27:03,259 --> 01:27:05,093
I don't want any more of that shit.

1314
01:27:05,261 --> 01:27:06,303
What shit?

1315
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:09,097
-Just stay away from the garbage.
-Look, Paulie--

1316
01:27:09,265 --> 01:27:12,434
I'm not talking about what you did inside.
You did what you had to do.

1317
01:27:12,602 --> 01:27:14,895
I'm talking about now. From now.
Here and now.

1318
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:18,941
-Why would I get into that?
-Don't make a jerk out of me.

1319
01:27:19,108 --> 01:27:20,651
Just don't do it.

1320
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:27,366
I want to talk to you about Jimmy.
You gotta watch out for him.

1321
01:27:27,533 --> 01:27:30,494
He's a good earner, but he's wild,
takes too many chances.

1322
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:32,829
I know Jimmy. You think
I would take chances like him?

1323
01:27:32,997 --> 01:27:34,790
Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy.

1324
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:36,583
He's a cowboy.
He's got too much to prove.

1325
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:38,543
You gotta watch out for kids like this.

1326
01:27:38,711 --> 01:27:41,338
I know what they are.
I only use them for certain things.

1327
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:44,007
I ain't gonna get fucked like Gribbs,
you understand?

1328
01:27:44,175 --> 01:27:48,512
Gribbs is 70 years old. The fucking guy's
gonna die in prison. I don't need that.

1329
01:27:48,846 --> 01:27:52,724
So I'm warning everybody. Everybody.
Could be my son, could be anybody.

1330
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:55,811
Gribbs got 20 years just
for saying hello to some fuck...

1331
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:58,063
who was sneaking behind his back,
selling junk.

1332
01:27:58,231 --> 01:28:00,691
I don't need that.
That won't happen to me, understand?

1333
01:28:00,858 --> 01:28:03,110
You know you're out early
because I got you a job.

1334
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,153
I don't need this heat,
you understand that?

1335
01:28:05,321 --> 01:28:09,032
You see anybody fucking around
with this shit you're gonna tell me, right?

1336
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:10,242
That means anybody.

1337
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:11,451
-All right.
-Yeah?

1338
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:13,328
Yeah. Of course.

1339
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:22,879
Took me about a week
of sneaking around...

1340
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:24,881
before I could unload
the Pittsburgh stuff.

1341
01:28:25,049 --> 01:28:27,509
But when I did, it was a real score.

1342
01:28:27,677 --> 01:28:30,220
I started using Sandy's place
to mix the stuff.

1343
01:28:30,388 --> 01:28:32,806
And even with Sandy snorting
more than she mixed...

1344
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:35,600
I could see that
this was a really good business.

1345
01:28:35,768 --> 01:28:38,186
I made $12,000 in my second week.

1346
01:28:38,771 --> 01:28:41,857
I had a down payment on my house
and things were really rolling.

1347
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:46,236
All I had to do was every once in a while
tell Sandy that I loved her.

1348
01:28:49,866 --> 01:28:51,908
But it was perfect, I'm telling you.

1349
01:28:52,076 --> 01:28:54,453
As long as I kept getting
the stuff from Pittsburgh...

1350
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:56,330
I knew Paulie would never find out.

1351
01:28:56,497 --> 01:29:00,375
Within a couple of weeks,
it got so big I needed some help.

1352
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:03,545
So I got Jimmy and Tommy
to come in with me.

1353
01:29:03,921 --> 01:29:05,464
It's fucking great.

1354
01:29:05,798 --> 01:29:06,923
Mr. Conway.

1355
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:14,681
-Bring your pay slips?
-Yeah.

1356
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:20,103
Four and a half months of dirt.

1357
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:23,231
- It's so good.
- I did it.

1358
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,985
- Do you love it?
- It's wonderful.

1359
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:31,198
And this we just had to have
made special. Go ahead, sit in it, Belle.

1360
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:33,909
The others you couldn't even sit in.

1361
01:29:34,118 --> 01:29:35,619
Okay, you ready?

1362
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:37,954
Watch the wall with the rock.

1363
01:29:45,588 --> 01:29:48,382
The electricians did it special. Come on.

1364
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,301
Come on. All right.

1365
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:55,097
This was imported. It came in two pieces.
Do you believe what they can do?

1366
01:29:55,264 --> 01:29:56,598
It's nice, huh?

1367
01:29:56,766 --> 01:29:58,767
Henry, come over here.
Did you and Jimmy talk?

1368
01:29:58,935 --> 01:30:01,269
I talked to him,
and he's looking into everything.

1369
01:30:01,437 --> 01:30:04,815
This'll make the Air France haul
look like goddamn peanuts.

1370
01:30:04,982 --> 01:30:07,234
-Shh! Come on.
-He's gonna do it, right?

1371
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:09,152
I told you. He'll check everything out.

1372
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:11,988
He's looking into it.
We'll see what happens. No promises.

1373
01:30:12,156 --> 01:30:16,326
I know. Do you understand?
There's millions in there. And I've been...

1374
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:20,122
bleeding for this caper, been cultivating
this son of a bitch for two years.

1375
01:30:20,331 --> 01:30:23,375
He owes me $20,000. Once in a lifetime.
I could retire.

1376
01:30:23,543 --> 01:30:27,421
No more nut every week.
No more bullshit. My dream comes true.

1377
01:30:27,588 --> 01:30:29,631
Morrie, let's get a drink.

1378
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:33,093
These are the guys that Jimmy
put together for what turned out to be...

1379
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:37,139
the biggest heist in American history:
the Lufthansa heist.

1380
01:30:38,391 --> 01:30:41,101
Tommy and Carbone were gonna grab
the outside guard...

1381
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:43,770
and make him get us in the front door.

1382
01:30:45,022 --> 01:30:48,316
Frenchy and Joe Buddha
had to round up the workers.

1383
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:52,863
Johnny Roastbeef had to keep them
all tied up and away from the alarms.

1384
01:30:53,656 --> 01:30:55,866
Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.

1385
01:30:56,033 --> 01:30:59,536
He used to hang around the lounge
and play guitar. Everybody loved Stacks.

1386
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:02,164
What he was supposed to do
was steal the panel truck...

1387
01:31:02,331 --> 01:31:05,459
and afterwards compact it
by a friend of ours out in Jersey.

1388
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:08,003
Only Morrie was driving us nuts.

1389
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:10,172
Morrie, have a drink and shut up.

1390
01:31:10,339 --> 01:31:13,383
Just because he set this up,
he felt he could bust Jimmy's balls...

1391
01:31:13,551 --> 01:31:16,094
for an advance on the money
we were going to steal.

1392
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:19,890
He didn't mean anything by it.
That's just the way he was.

1393
01:31:26,772 --> 01:31:30,901
I had everybody working for me.
Even our old baby-sitter, Lois Byrd.

1394
01:31:33,821 --> 01:31:35,238
Did you have a good flight?

1395
01:31:35,406 --> 01:31:37,908
I hate Pittsburgh.
Where did you find such creeps?

1396
01:31:38,117 --> 01:31:40,035
Come on, they're not that bad.

1397
01:31:41,245 --> 01:31:43,121
And it's worth it, isn't it?

1398
01:31:43,414 --> 01:31:45,874
Is this the same baby you used last week?

1399
01:31:46,042 --> 01:31:49,127
No, that one was my sister's.
This is Deirdra's.

1400
01:31:50,004 --> 01:31:51,046
Big yawn.

1401
01:31:51,214 --> 01:31:53,048
She looks just like you.

1402
01:31:53,841 --> 01:31:56,176
That's what the stewardess said.

1403
01:32:08,814 --> 01:32:10,774
Take it easy, Sandy.

1404
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:13,652
Come on, give me a break.
You got enough here to go around.

1405
01:32:13,819 --> 01:32:17,155
You got all day. Just make it last,
all right? Take it easy.

1406
01:32:17,615 --> 01:32:19,449
-I got to go.
-Where are you going?

1407
01:32:19,617 --> 01:32:23,703
Don't start. You know I gotta go
do this thing. Fuck, where are my keys?

1408
01:32:24,997 --> 01:32:26,373
Over there.

1409
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:28,250
It's a mess. It's like a pig pen.

1410
01:32:28,417 --> 01:32:30,460
What do you think
I got you the dishwasher for?

1411
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:32,420
I hate doing the dishes. Fucks up my nails.

1412
01:32:32,588 --> 01:32:34,297
How could you hate it?
You got to be smart.

1413
01:32:34,465 --> 01:32:37,634
Look at all this powder around here.
That could put us away forever.

1414
01:32:37,802 --> 01:32:40,011
-Loosen up.
-Whoa, what are you doing?

1415
01:32:41,138 --> 01:32:44,474
-You know, I gotta....
-You don't have to go anywhere.

1416
01:32:45,643 --> 01:32:47,143
Make them wait.

1417
01:32:56,112 --> 01:32:57,904
Nobody knows for sure...

1418
01:32:58,072 --> 01:33:00,198
just how much was taken
in the daring pre-dawn raid...

1419
01:33:00,366 --> 01:33:02,993
at the Lufthansa cargo terminal
at Kennedy Airport.

1420
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:06,871
The FBI says $2 million,
Port Authority Police say $4 million--

1421
01:33:10,126 --> 01:33:12,294
Jimmy!

1422
01:33:12,461 --> 01:33:14,296
Those sons of bitches!

1423
01:33:14,463 --> 01:33:16,798
...from the scene of the heist at JFK.

1424
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:20,594
It looks like a big one. Maybe the biggest
this town has ever seen.

1425
01:33:22,513 --> 01:33:24,681
Come here, you! Come here!

1426
01:33:25,725 --> 01:33:28,435
Look at this genius. This genius!

1427
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:34,524
Merry Christmas.

1428
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,698
-Hello, who's this?
-That's my wife.

1429
01:33:42,658 --> 01:33:45,952
Come here.
I want to show you something, Jimmy.

1430
01:33:48,664 --> 01:33:50,040
Isn't she gorgeous?

1431
01:33:50,207 --> 01:33:53,376
I bought it for my wife.
It's a coupe. I love that car.

1432
01:33:56,213 --> 01:33:59,049
What did I tell you?
I talked to you before, didn't I?

1433
01:33:59,216 --> 01:34:00,550
Didn't I say what was going on?

1434
01:34:00,718 --> 01:34:02,802
Didn't I say not to go buy anything
for a while?

1435
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:05,972
-The fucking car?
-It's a wedding gift from my mother.

1436
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:08,266
It's under her name. I just got married.

1437
01:34:08,434 --> 01:34:11,227
-I love that car.
-Excuse me, darling, for just a second.

1438
01:34:11,395 --> 01:34:13,688
- I just got married.
- Are you nuts?

1439
01:34:13,856 --> 01:34:16,483
-What are you getting excited for?
-Are you stupid?

1440
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:19,152
We got a million bulls out there.
Everybody's watching us.

1441
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:21,196
And you get a fucking car. I'm excited?

1442
01:34:21,364 --> 01:34:23,406
It's under my mother's name.
It's a wedding gift.

1443
01:34:23,574 --> 01:34:25,617
I don't give a fuck. Are you stupid?

1444
01:34:25,785 --> 01:34:27,744
Didn't you hear what I said?
Don't buy anything.

1445
01:34:27,912 --> 01:34:31,623
Don't get anything. Nothing big.
What's the matter with you?

1446
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:33,375
What are you getting excited for?

1447
01:34:33,542 --> 01:34:36,878
Because you're going to get us all
fucking pinched. What are you, stupid?

1448
01:34:37,046 --> 01:34:39,798
-What's the matter with you?
-I apologize.

1449
01:34:41,258 --> 01:34:44,469
-I'm sorry.
-What the fuck is the matter with you?

1450
01:34:46,764 --> 01:34:48,098
I'm sorry.

1451
01:34:50,601 --> 01:34:54,104
I'm sorry, Jimmy.
It's under my mother's name.

1452
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:57,232
What'd you say? You being
a fucking wise guy with me?

1453
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:00,527
-I'm sorry. I apologize.
-What did I tell you?

1454
01:35:00,986 --> 01:35:04,114
What did I tell you?
You don't buy anything, you hear me?

1455
01:35:04,281 --> 01:35:05,740
Don't buy anything!

1456
01:35:05,908 --> 01:35:07,492
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1457
01:35:10,746 --> 01:35:13,164
The fat fuck, he ought to wear a sign.

1458
01:35:20,631 --> 01:35:22,966
I can't believe this.
Are you stupid or what?

1459
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:24,467
Excuse me.

1460
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:26,386
-What's the matter?
-Take it off.

1461
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:29,514
-Why? What's the matter?
-Take it off!

1462
01:35:31,684 --> 01:35:35,228
Didn't I tell you not to get anything big
and not to attract attention?

1463
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:38,481
In two days, one guy gets a Caddy
and one gets a $20,000 mink.

1464
01:35:38,649 --> 01:35:40,525
-Bring it fucking back.
-I'll bring it back.

1465
01:35:40,693 --> 01:35:44,195
I don't care what you do.
Bring it where you got it before.

1466
01:35:44,363 --> 01:35:47,115
-Get it out of here!
-All right. Let's go, honey.

1467
01:35:51,328 --> 01:35:53,496
Shut the fuck up and let's go.

1468
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:59,085
This drink here is better than sex, babe.

1469
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:05,175
I'm gonna go see Stacks. Don't you look
at anybody or I'll fucking kill you.

1470
01:36:05,342 --> 01:36:09,554
He's so jealous. If I even look
at anyone else, he'll kill me.

1471
01:36:09,805 --> 01:36:11,264
That's great.

1472
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:14,517
Tell them all to relax.
Don't attract attention.

1473
01:36:17,563 --> 01:36:19,439
I've been looking all over for you.

1474
01:36:19,607 --> 01:36:21,191
How are you? Merry Christmas.

1475
01:36:21,358 --> 01:36:23,359
Listen, I need the money.

1476
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:27,238
-Morrie, relax, okay? It's Christmas.
-Jimmy, I need the money.

1477
01:36:27,406 --> 01:36:29,574
I'm relaxing. I need the money.

1478
01:36:29,742 --> 01:36:32,660
-I did what I had to do. I need the money.
-Not tonight, Morrie.

1479
01:36:32,828 --> 01:36:36,915
Listen, I did my caper. He owes me.
Everybody's flashing their stuff.

1480
01:36:37,082 --> 01:36:39,751
Evidently, they got their money.
I'm wearing the same shit.

1481
01:36:39,919 --> 01:36:43,213
-Just not tonight.
-They're wearing it. I gotta talk to him.

1482
01:36:45,716 --> 01:36:48,343
I got $500,000 coming to me.

1483
01:36:48,511 --> 01:36:50,845
The biggest fucking bundle
he ever made in his life.

1484
01:36:51,013 --> 01:36:53,681
Morrie, I'll go talk to him.
Go have a drink, all right?

1485
01:36:53,849 --> 01:36:55,934
-I'll talk to him.
-It's poison in my eyes.

1486
01:36:56,101 --> 01:36:59,020
-Morris, baby, are you all right?
-No, I'm not.

1487
01:37:04,735 --> 01:37:08,112
Christmas. Your share. Just a little taste.

1488
01:37:11,325 --> 01:37:12,659
We did it!

1489
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:17,372
- Jimmy.
- Yeah.

1490
01:37:17,998 --> 01:37:19,916
- Yeah, who is it?
- It's me.

1491
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:21,709
Pete? One second.

1492
01:37:22,586 --> 01:37:25,338
Don't do what Frankie and Johnny did.
Don't be a moron with the money.

1493
01:37:25,506 --> 01:37:27,048
-Do what's right, you understand?
-Yeah.

1494
01:37:28,968 --> 01:37:30,927
Karen, Judy, Ruth, come here!

1495
01:37:31,428 --> 01:37:34,180
I got the most expensive tree they had.

1496
01:37:35,599 --> 01:37:39,269
-What do you think, Mommy?
-I love them all.

1497
01:37:39,436 --> 01:37:41,062
I love the gold outfit.

1498
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:42,939
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you.

1499
01:37:43,107 --> 01:37:44,482
-What?
-Merry Christmas.

1500
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:45,942
And?

1501
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:47,402
Happy Hanukkah.

1502
01:37:48,779 --> 01:37:49,821
Very funny.

1503
01:37:49,989 --> 01:37:52,031
Go get yourself something nice, okay?

1504
01:38:00,332 --> 01:38:04,711
Lufthansa should have been
our ultimate score. The heist of a lifetime.

1505
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:08,548
$6 million in cash.
More than enough to go around.

1506
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:19,976
Yo, Stacks!

1507
01:38:20,352 --> 01:38:22,979
Open up! What's up? What're you doing?

1508
01:38:29,278 --> 01:38:33,156
What's with you? He ain't ready.
I knew you wouldn't be ready.

1509
01:38:33,324 --> 01:38:36,576
-You didn't bring any coffee?
-What do I look like, a fucking caterer?

1510
01:38:36,744 --> 01:38:39,662
Frankie will make coffee.
Go ahead, Frankie, make coffee.

1511
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:44,834
Thought you had
one of your bitches in here.

1512
01:38:45,002 --> 01:38:47,378
Yeah, I did. Where the fuck is she?

1513
01:38:48,380 --> 01:38:51,382
Always got these hot books around,
or a bitch, or something.

1514
01:38:51,550 --> 01:38:52,759
What time is it?

1515
01:38:52,927 --> 01:38:56,888
-It's 11:30. We had to be there by 9:00.
-I'll be ready in a minute.

1516
01:38:57,056 --> 01:39:00,934
You're always fucking late.
You'd be late for your own fucking funeral.

1517
01:39:05,898 --> 01:39:09,859
What the fuck you looking at?
Make that coffee to go. Let's go.

1518
01:39:12,988 --> 01:39:14,864
What the fuck you doing? It's a joke.

1519
01:39:15,032 --> 01:39:17,909
Put the fucking pot down.
You gonna take the coffee?

1520
01:39:37,721 --> 01:39:39,681
Stacks was always crazy.

1521
01:39:40,015 --> 01:39:43,685
Instead of getting rid of the truck
as he was supposed to, he got stoned...

1522
01:39:43,852 --> 01:39:48,398
went to his girlfriend's, and by the time
he woke up, the cops had found the truck.

1523
01:39:48,565 --> 01:39:50,650
It was all over the television.

1524
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:53,695
They even said they came up
with prints off the wheel.

1525
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:57,991
It was just a matter of time
before they got to Stacks.

1526
01:40:09,753 --> 01:40:11,546
I gotta talk to you.

1527
01:40:11,755 --> 01:40:14,382
-Have a drink.
-Have a drink. Come on.

1528
01:40:14,883 --> 01:40:18,678
Have a drink. What you doing?
It's an occasion. Have a drink.

1529
01:40:19,972 --> 01:40:21,931
I still gotta talk to you.

1530
01:40:22,349 --> 01:40:23,391
What?

1531
01:40:23,559 --> 01:40:26,060
-What happened with Stacks?
-Don't worry about that.

1532
01:40:26,228 --> 01:40:29,981
-There's feds all over the place.
-So what? Where are they gonna go?

1533
01:40:30,524 --> 01:40:33,067
-It's in the papers.
-He's worried.

1534
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:34,777
What are you worried about?

1535
01:40:35,446 --> 01:40:38,906
The television and the newspapers.
All the shit's out there.

1536
01:40:39,074 --> 01:40:42,285
-What are you worried about?
-You worry too much.

1537
01:40:42,745 --> 01:40:45,246
Everything is beautiful.
There's nothing to worry about.

1538
01:40:45,414 --> 01:40:47,790
-Didn't you tell him?
-I didn't tell him yet.

1539
01:40:47,958 --> 01:40:49,417
-What?
-Guess what?

1540
01:40:50,961 --> 01:40:52,628
They're gonna make him.

1541
01:40:54,298 --> 01:40:56,257
Paulie's going to make you?

1542
01:40:57,051 --> 01:40:58,176
Tommy.

1543
01:40:58,343 --> 01:41:00,845
They opened up the books.
Paulie got the okay.

1544
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:03,681
You believe that?
This little guinea bastard.

1545
01:41:04,725 --> 01:41:09,145
He's gonna get made. We're gonna work
for this guy one day. He's gonna be a boss.

1546
01:41:10,230 --> 01:41:11,814
I can't believe it.

1547
01:41:11,982 --> 01:41:14,275
I'm really happy for you.
Great. Congratulations.

1548
01:41:14,443 --> 01:41:16,319
Motherfuckers, we got them now.

1549
01:41:17,112 --> 01:41:21,365
Jimmy, I've been looking all over for you.
Can I talk to you a second?

1550
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:24,494
I mastermind the goddamn thing,
I'm left with dick.

1551
01:41:24,661 --> 01:41:28,039
They'd be up a creek if not for me.
Fuck him! I want my money.

1552
01:41:28,373 --> 01:41:30,500
I want my money! I've had it up to here!

1553
01:41:30,667 --> 01:41:33,002
That cheap cigarette hijacker.

1554
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:35,963
-Fuck him! I want my money!
-Good. Go tell him.

1555
01:41:38,675 --> 01:41:42,553
You're gonna keep your mouth shut,
or what? Huh?

1556
01:41:43,055 --> 01:41:45,014
Morrie, you're gonna get your money.

1557
01:41:45,182 --> 01:41:47,642
You just got to stop busting balls.

1558
01:41:48,018 --> 01:41:50,853
All right? Look at me. You hear me?
Look at me, okay?

1559
01:41:51,063 --> 01:41:53,272
Everything's going to be fine.

1560
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:00,404
Henry.

1561
01:42:06,036 --> 01:42:09,539
Sweetheart, half mick, half guinea?
I'll sing with an Italian accent.

1562
01:42:51,790 --> 01:42:55,168
I could see for the first time
that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.

1563
01:42:55,335 --> 01:42:58,504
His mind was going in
eight different directions at once.

1564
01:43:00,799 --> 01:43:03,259
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?

1565
01:43:03,552 --> 01:43:04,927
Morrie? Him?

1566
01:43:05,512 --> 01:43:08,389
That's when I knew
Jimmy was going to whack Morrie.

1567
01:43:08,557 --> 01:43:12,894
That's how it happens. That's how fast
it takes for a guy to get whacked.

1568
01:43:13,562 --> 01:43:15,938
He's a nut job. He talks to everybody.

1569
01:43:16,106 --> 01:43:19,609
Acts like a jerk in his commercials.
Nobody listens to what he says.

1570
01:43:19,776 --> 01:43:22,945
Nobody fucking cares what he says,
he talks so much.

1571
01:43:23,155 --> 01:43:25,781
Make sure you bring him here tonight.

1572
01:43:25,949 --> 01:43:27,575
-Okay?
-All right.

1573
01:43:30,037 --> 01:43:32,872
Start like this. Sorry.
Did I get you in the eye?

1574
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:34,874
Stop breaking my balls, all right?

1575
01:43:35,042 --> 01:43:37,043
I was just stalling for time.

1576
01:43:37,794 --> 01:43:41,881
I knew I still had till 8:00 or 9:00
to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.

1577
01:43:42,090 --> 01:43:46,135
But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew,
I was going along with the program.

1578
01:43:46,303 --> 01:43:50,056
I pulled his hair out of his
fucking head. I bit him. He's out cold.

1579
01:43:52,142 --> 01:43:54,435
I'm enraged.
I wanted to kill this little fuck.

1580
01:43:54,603 --> 01:43:57,521
I walk away.
We start to go in the fucking joint.

1581
01:43:57,898 --> 01:44:00,733
I don't want to turn around.
Jimmy's going like this to me.

1582
01:44:01,652 --> 01:44:03,444
I don't want to fucking turn around.

1583
01:44:03,612 --> 01:44:07,031
I don't want to turn around. He picks up
his fucking head, he says....

1584
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:08,324
Ah-- Ah--

1585
01:44:08,492 --> 01:44:10,326
I said, "Don't say it."

1586
01:44:12,162 --> 01:44:14,163
Ah-- Ah-- Ah--

1587
01:44:15,249 --> 01:44:16,582
"Jerkoff!"

1588
01:44:19,336 --> 01:44:22,838
What are you going to do? What?
I fucking fly at him.

1589
01:44:23,006 --> 01:44:26,008
I got him and I'm banging his head,
banging his fucking face.

1590
01:44:26,176 --> 01:44:27,885
I'm pulling his hair out of his head.

1591
01:44:28,053 --> 01:44:31,055
I beat him to a pulp. To a pulp I beat him.

1592
01:44:31,223 --> 01:44:34,183
He's laying there full of fucking blood.
I'm out of breath.

1593
01:44:34,351 --> 01:44:36,936
Forget about tonight. Forget about it.

1594
01:44:37,771 --> 01:44:39,814
It was a load off my mind.

1595
01:44:40,899 --> 01:44:42,108
Poor bastard.

1596
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:44,527
He never knew how close he'd come
to getting killed.

1597
01:44:44,695 --> 01:44:47,613
Even if I told him,
he would have never believed me.

1598
01:44:49,449 --> 01:44:53,369
- Jimmy, could I talk to you now?
- You're a pisser. A real pisser.

1599
01:44:53,996 --> 01:44:57,206
Want to talk now? Okay, let's talk.
Let's get it over with.

1600
01:44:57,374 --> 01:45:00,376
I've never met a ball buster like you,
my whole life.

1601
01:45:00,544 --> 01:45:02,545
Who loves you more than I do?

1602
01:45:02,713 --> 01:45:06,048
-I'd do anything for you.
-Except to stop busting my balls.

1603
01:45:06,967 --> 01:45:09,385
-Let's go have coffee.
-Want to go to the diner?

1604
01:45:09,553 --> 01:45:11,804
We'll go to the diner on the boulevard.

1605
01:45:12,514 --> 01:45:15,433
-Which diner?
-Rockaway Boulevard. It's open 24 hours.

1606
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,727
-They got Danishes?
-They got everything.

1607
01:45:17,894 --> 01:45:20,187
Let's pick up some Danishes for Belle.

1608
01:45:20,731 --> 01:45:25,067
Hear about the points we were shaving
up in Boston? It's terrific. Nunzio--

1609
01:45:33,243 --> 01:45:34,744
I thought he'd never shut up.

1610
01:45:34,911 --> 01:45:36,537
What a pain in the ass.

1611
01:45:36,705 --> 01:45:39,582
-What'll we do with him?
-Chop him up and get rid of the car.

1612
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:41,709
Call me when you're through.

1613
01:45:41,877 --> 01:45:44,295
- Frank, let's chop him up.
- All right.

1614
01:45:44,463 --> 01:45:47,006
Where you going,
you dizzy motherfucker, you?

1615
01:45:47,174 --> 01:45:48,215
You said chop him up.

1616
01:45:48,383 --> 01:45:51,719
At Charlie's, not here!
Where are you gonna chop him here?

1617
01:45:52,721 --> 01:45:55,348
Come on, what are you doing?
Get out of here.

1618
01:45:55,515 --> 01:45:57,600
I got a better shot letting him drive.

1619
01:45:57,768 --> 01:45:59,518
The car's cold.

1620
01:45:59,686 --> 01:46:03,272
Get the fuck out of here!
What, warm it up? Get out of here!

1621
01:46:04,107 --> 01:46:06,567
- Who is it?
- It's Belle. Open up.

1622
01:46:06,735 --> 01:46:08,444
It's Belle. Let me in.

1623
01:46:09,279 --> 01:46:13,115
Morris didn't come home. He's missing.
I know something's happened.

1624
01:46:13,283 --> 01:46:14,617
Calm down.

1625
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:17,328
He's missing! I know something happened.

1626
01:46:17,496 --> 01:46:19,705
He's probably drunk
and fell asleep somewhere.

1627
01:46:19,873 --> 01:46:23,542
In 27 years, he's never been away all night
without calling.

1628
01:46:23,710 --> 01:46:26,462
I know something's happened.
I know you know.

1629
01:46:26,630 --> 01:46:30,132
Let me get changed.
I'll take you home, then look for him.

1630
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:32,551
I've been home! I've been on the phone--

1631
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:34,011
He's playing cards.

1632
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:39,642
-What'll I tell Belle?
-Who gives a fuck?

1633
01:46:40,519 --> 01:46:43,979
Tell her he ran off with some broad.
What do you care?

1634
01:46:44,147 --> 01:46:46,190
-Watch this.
-Don't fuck with them.

1635
01:46:46,358 --> 01:46:48,317
I do it all the time. I'll bust their balls.

1636
01:46:48,485 --> 01:46:51,320
Don't give them the satisfaction,
the fucks.

1637
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:55,866
Come on, fuckos. Let's go for a ride.

1638
01:46:57,452 --> 01:46:59,161
Keep them up all night.

1639
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:01,664
I'll see you later.

1640
01:47:51,339 --> 01:47:54,508
Jimmy was cutting every link
between himself and the robbery...

1641
01:47:54,676 --> 01:47:57,052
but it had nothing to do with me.

1642
01:48:07,564 --> 01:48:10,900
I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me
some Christmas money.

1643
01:48:12,652 --> 01:48:15,029
From then on, I kept my mouth shut.

1644
01:48:15,197 --> 01:48:19,074
I knew Jimmy.
He had the cash. It was his.

1645
01:48:19,242 --> 01:48:22,578
He kicked some money upstairs to Paulie,
but that was it.

1646
01:48:23,663 --> 01:48:27,124
It made him sick to turn the money over
to the guys who stole it.

1647
01:48:27,292 --> 01:48:30,127
He'd rather whack them.
Anyway, what did I care?

1648
01:48:30,295 --> 01:48:32,129
I wasn't asking for anything.

1649
01:48:32,297 --> 01:48:35,925
And Jimmy was making nice money
through my Pittsburgh connections.

1650
01:48:36,468 --> 01:48:40,554
Still, months after the robbery
they were finding bodies all over.

1651
01:49:02,577 --> 01:49:05,287
When they found Carbone
in the meat truck...

1652
01:49:05,455 --> 01:49:07,122
he was frozen so stiff...

1653
01:49:07,290 --> 01:49:10,417
it took them two days
to thaw him out for the autopsy.

1654
01:49:15,257 --> 01:49:17,383
Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy.

1655
01:49:17,801 --> 01:49:21,387
He was like a kid. We had money
coming in through my Pittsburgh people...

1656
01:49:21,555 --> 01:49:25,099
and even after a while,
the Lufthansa thing began to calm down.

1657
01:49:25,267 --> 01:49:27,434
What made Jimmy so happy
that morning...

1658
01:49:27,602 --> 01:49:30,479
was that this was the day
that Tommy was being made.

1659
01:49:30,981 --> 01:49:33,983
Jimmy was so excited,
you'd think he was being made.

1660
01:49:34,609 --> 01:49:37,236
He must have made four calls
to Tommy's house.

1661
01:49:37,445 --> 01:49:41,365
They had a signal set up, so he'd know
the minute the ceremony was over.

1662
01:49:42,242 --> 01:49:44,493
- Ma, where are you?
- Here I am.

1663
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:47,663
-You're home.
-Home? I'm leaving.

1664
01:49:48,123 --> 01:49:50,666
-You look lovely.
-I look good, huh?

1665
01:49:50,834 --> 01:49:54,211
You look wonderful. Be careful.
Congratulations.

1666
01:49:54,879 --> 01:49:58,215
I love you. Don't paint
any more religious pictures, please.

1667
01:49:58,383 --> 01:50:00,009
-God be with you.
-Bye, Ma.

1668
01:50:00,176 --> 01:50:02,511
We always called each other goodfellas.

1669
01:50:02,679 --> 01:50:04,305
You'd say to somebody:

1670
01:50:04,472 --> 01:50:08,684
"You'll like this guy. He's all right.
He's a goodfella, one of us."

1671
01:50:09,019 --> 01:50:10,394
You understand?

1672
01:50:11,062 --> 01:50:13,272
We were goodfellas. Wiseguys.

1673
01:50:15,859 --> 01:50:19,236
But Jimmy and I could never be made
because we had Irish blood.

1674
01:50:19,404 --> 01:50:21,864
It didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.

1675
01:50:22,115 --> 01:50:26,035
To become a member of a crew,
you've got to be 100% Italian...

1676
01:50:26,202 --> 01:50:29,204
so they can trace your relatives
back to the old country.

1677
01:50:36,546 --> 01:50:38,881
It's the highest honor they can give you.

1678
01:50:39,049 --> 01:50:41,550
It means you belong
to a family and a crew.

1679
01:50:41,926 --> 01:50:44,470
It means nobody can fuck around
with you.

1680
01:50:45,013 --> 01:50:47,389
It also means you could
fuck around with anybody...

1681
01:50:47,557 --> 01:50:50,017
just as long as they aren't also a member.

1682
01:50:50,185 --> 01:50:53,604
It's like a license to steal.
A license to do anything.

1683
01:50:55,774 --> 01:50:57,775
How many years ago
since you were made?

1684
01:50:57,942 --> 01:51:00,694
- I'm an old-timer. 30 years ago.
- Thirty years?

1685
01:51:00,862 --> 01:51:05,115
Brings back a lot of memories.
Pike's Peak was a pimple then, wasn't it?

1686
01:51:08,411 --> 01:51:11,372
As far as Jimmy was concerned,
with Tommy being made...

1687
01:51:11,539 --> 01:51:13,916
it was like we were all being made.

1688
01:51:14,793 --> 01:51:17,336
We would now have
one of our own as a member.

1689
01:51:28,890 --> 01:51:30,099
Oh, no--

1690
01:51:33,103 --> 01:51:34,937
- Who's this?
- This is Vinnie.

1691
01:51:35,105 --> 01:51:37,940
Vinnie. What happened?
Did we get straightened out?

1692
01:51:38,108 --> 01:51:41,110
No, we had a problem.
We tried to do everything we could.

1693
01:51:41,277 --> 01:51:42,319
What do you mean?

1694
01:51:42,487 --> 01:51:46,615
You know what I mean. He's gone,
and we couldn't do nothing about it.

1695
01:51:48,493 --> 01:51:50,369
-That's it.
-What do you mean?

1696
01:51:50,537 --> 01:51:51,912
He's gone.

1697
01:51:53,873 --> 01:51:54,915
That's it.

1698
01:51:59,796 --> 01:52:02,631
I knew it! I can't fucking believe it.

1699
01:52:13,017 --> 01:52:15,144
-What happened?
-They fucking whacked him.

1700
01:52:15,311 --> 01:52:16,478
Fuck.

1701
01:52:32,328 --> 01:52:33,996
Are you all right?

1702
01:52:41,045 --> 01:52:43,547
It was revenge for Billy Batts...

1703
01:52:43,715 --> 01:52:45,466
and a lot of other things.

1704
01:52:45,633 --> 01:52:46,675
And that's that.

1705
01:52:46,843 --> 01:52:49,344
There was nothing we could do about it.

1706
01:52:49,512 --> 01:52:52,139
Batts was a made man
and Tommy wasn't.

1707
01:52:52,724 --> 01:52:54,516
We had to sit still and take it.

1708
01:52:54,684 --> 01:52:58,270
It was among the Italians.
It was real greaseball shit.

1709
01:53:10,909 --> 01:53:12,743
They even shot Tommy in the face...

1710
01:53:12,911 --> 01:53:16,371
so his mother couldn't give him
an open coffin at the funeral.

1711
01:54:03,878 --> 01:54:07,172
I was gonna be busy all day.
I had to drop off some guns at Jimmy's...

1712
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:09,007
to match some silencers he had.

1713
01:54:09,175 --> 01:54:12,261
I had to pick up my brother at the hospital
and drive him home.

1714
01:54:12,428 --> 01:54:14,847
I had to pick up
some new Pittsburgh stuff for Lois...

1715
01:54:15,014 --> 01:54:18,267
to fly down to some customers
I had near Atlanta.

1716
01:54:29,571 --> 01:54:33,031
Right away, I knew he didn't want them,
and I'd be stuck for the money.

1717
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:36,910
I only bought them because
he wanted them, and now he didn't.

1718
01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:41,123
What good are these? None of them fit.
What's the matter with you?

1719
01:54:41,291 --> 01:54:42,499
I'm not paying for it.

1720
01:54:42,667 --> 01:54:46,378
I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was
so pissed off, he didn't even say goodbye.

1721
01:54:46,546 --> 01:54:48,797
Stop the drugs. They're making
your mind into mush!

1722
01:54:48,965 --> 01:54:50,299
-You hear me?
-I'll take them back.

1723
01:55:04,022 --> 01:55:05,981
My Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.

1724
01:55:06,149 --> 01:55:09,735
Since I would see them in the afternoon
to pick up a delivery...

1725
01:55:09,903 --> 01:55:12,487
I was pretty sure I'd get my money back.

1726
01:55:31,507 --> 01:55:32,591
Oh, my God.

1727
01:55:34,344 --> 01:55:38,388
When I finally got to the hospital,
Michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed.

1728
01:55:38,556 --> 01:55:40,682
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?

1729
01:55:41,726 --> 01:55:44,102
I almost got into an accident
on the way here.

1730
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:47,189
And I told him I was partying all night.

1731
01:55:47,357 --> 01:55:49,149
-I'm fine.
-Come on. Get over here.

1732
01:55:49,317 --> 01:55:51,401
-Doc, I'm fine.
-Let me check you out.

1733
01:55:51,903 --> 01:55:53,070
Come on.

1734
01:55:56,115 --> 01:55:58,784
He took mercy on me,
gave me 10 milligrams of Valium...

1735
01:55:58,952 --> 01:56:00,035
and sent me home.

1736
01:56:00,745 --> 01:56:04,498
My plan was to drop off my brother
at the house and pick up Karen.

1737
01:56:06,542 --> 01:56:09,753
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?

1738
01:56:09,921 --> 01:56:13,256
Right in front of us, there.
I think it's been following me all morning.

1739
01:56:13,424 --> 01:56:16,176
-Get the fuck out. What are you, nuts?
-I'm telling you.

1740
01:56:16,344 --> 01:56:17,803
I don't know what's going on.

1741
01:56:17,971 --> 01:56:20,847
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital I saw it.

1742
01:56:21,015 --> 01:56:23,392
I had to make some stops.
I've seen it every time.

1743
01:56:23,559 --> 01:56:25,978
I've been all over town
and I've seen it all day.

1744
01:56:32,944 --> 01:56:34,569
I was cooking dinner that night.

1745
01:56:35,697 --> 01:56:39,366
I had to start braising the beef
and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.

1746
01:56:42,036 --> 01:56:45,247
It was Michael's favorite.
I was making ziti with meat gravy...

1747
01:56:45,415 --> 01:56:47,916
and I'm planning to roast some peppers
over the flames...

1748
01:56:48,084 --> 01:56:52,045
put on some string beans with olive oil.
I had some beautiful cutlets...

1749
01:56:52,213 --> 01:56:53,255
that were cut just right...

1750
01:56:53,423 --> 01:56:56,341
that I was going to fry up as an appetizer.

1751
01:56:56,509 --> 01:56:58,593
So I was home for about an hour.

1752
01:56:58,803 --> 01:57:00,762
My plan was to start the dinner early...

1753
01:57:00,930 --> 01:57:03,473
so Karen and I could unload the guns
Jimmy didn't want...

1754
01:57:03,641 --> 01:57:05,058
then get the package for Lois...

1755
01:57:05,226 --> 01:57:07,769
to take to Atlanta for her trip
later that night.

1756
01:57:08,646 --> 01:57:12,441
I kept looking out the window,
and I saw that the helicopter was gone.

1757
01:57:13,067 --> 01:57:16,570
Michael, keep an eye on the sauce.
Stay here with your Uncle Michael.

1758
01:57:17,697 --> 01:57:21,450
So I asked my brother to watch the sauce,
and Karen and I started out.

1759
01:57:24,370 --> 01:57:26,455
Oh, God. I see it.

1760
01:57:26,706 --> 01:57:29,207
-I see it. Look, it's right there.
-Damn!

1761
01:57:30,418 --> 01:57:31,835
- That's it.
- There it is.

1762
01:57:32,003 --> 01:57:33,628
We got to get to your mother's.

1763
01:57:34,255 --> 01:57:35,505
See, I told you.

1764
01:57:35,715 --> 01:57:37,090
It's funny.

1765
01:57:37,467 --> 01:57:40,469
-It's not the end of the world.
-We're going to your mother's.

1766
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:12,709
Go inside, tell your mother not to touch
anything outside the house. Nothing.

1767
01:58:12,877 --> 01:58:15,629
We couldn't go to your mother's house?
You had to come here.

1768
01:58:21,177 --> 01:58:22,844
Let's go shopping.

1769
01:58:25,098 --> 01:58:27,224
I'm not nuts,
it's been following me all morning.

1770
01:58:28,392 --> 01:58:29,518
I'm telling you.

1771
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:33,772
Fine. Fine. He thinks I'm paranoid!

1772
01:58:34,857 --> 01:58:38,235
I should bring him the helicopter,
then we'll see how paranoid I am.

1773
01:58:40,238 --> 01:58:41,863
Come on, let's go inside.

1774
01:58:46,244 --> 01:58:48,161
-Yeah, it's gone.
-I don't hear anything.

1775
01:58:48,329 --> 01:58:49,538
Let's go back to your mother's.

1776
01:59:03,511 --> 01:59:06,054
- They all right?
- Beautiful. They're great.

1777
01:59:06,889 --> 01:59:09,558
Didn't I tell you, you were paranoid?
Didn't I tell him?

1778
01:59:09,725 --> 01:59:11,226
Yeah. I need a hit.

1779
01:59:11,811 --> 01:59:14,813
Want to see helicopters?
Come on, I'll show you helicopters.

1780
01:59:14,981 --> 01:59:17,899
I've seen enough helicopters for one day,
thank you.

1781
01:59:18,901 --> 01:59:23,280
I had to get home and get the
package ready for Lois to take on her trip.

1782
01:59:23,447 --> 01:59:26,241
Also, I had to get to Sandy's to give
the package a whack with quinine.

1783
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:29,911
Plus, I knew Sandy would get on my ass.

1784
01:59:30,079 --> 01:59:33,790
I had the cooking to finish,
and I had to get Lois ready for her trip.

1785
01:59:33,958 --> 01:59:36,501
-It's Sandy. What is this?
-She's a pain in the ass.

1786
01:59:37,211 --> 01:59:38,879
When are you coming over?

1787
01:59:39,046 --> 01:59:40,922
-In an hour.
-You staying tonight, right?

1788
01:59:41,090 --> 01:59:43,091
I can't. I got my brother tonight.

1789
01:59:43,426 --> 01:59:47,512
Come on, stop.
We'll talk about it later, okay? Goodbye.

1790
01:59:55,146 --> 01:59:57,147
- Hello?
- It's me. You ready?

1791
01:59:58,316 --> 02:00:00,984
Tell Michael not to let the sauce stick.
Keep stirring it.

1792
02:00:01,569 --> 02:00:05,405
-Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
-I'm stirring it.

1793
02:00:05,573 --> 02:00:07,449
-Listen, you know what to do?
-Yeah, yeah.

1794
02:00:07,617 --> 02:00:09,784
Don't "yeah, yeah" me, Lois.
This is important.

1795
02:00:09,952 --> 02:00:12,412
Make sure you leave the house
when you make the call.

1796
02:00:12,580 --> 02:00:15,790
Understand me?
Call from an outside line. I mean it.

1797
02:00:15,958 --> 02:00:19,794
Jesus, you must think I'm dumb. Why
are you bugging me? I know what to do.

1798
02:00:19,962 --> 02:00:22,255
You little hick, just make sure you do it.

1799
02:00:22,423 --> 02:00:23,465
You can be such a pain.

1800
02:00:23,633 --> 02:00:27,594
-Hey! Just do it!
-Okay.

1801
02:00:28,387 --> 02:00:32,891
Un-fucking-believable. All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.

1802
02:00:34,268 --> 02:00:36,394
-What did he say?
-Nothing.

1803
02:00:36,562 --> 02:00:38,855
What does she do
after she hangs up with me?

1804
02:00:39,023 --> 02:00:42,525
After everything I told her?
After all her "yeah, yeah" bullshit?

1805
02:00:42,693 --> 02:00:45,320
She picks up the phone
and calls from the house.

1806
02:00:45,488 --> 02:00:47,822
If anybody was listening,
they'd know everything.

1807
02:00:47,990 --> 02:00:49,908
They'd know a package
was leaving my house...

1808
02:00:50,076 --> 02:00:53,328
and they'd even have the time and
flight number, thanks to her.

1809
02:00:54,497 --> 02:00:57,165
As soon as I got home, I started cooking.

1810
02:00:57,333 --> 02:00:59,417
I had a few hours until Lois' flight.

1811
02:00:59,585 --> 02:01:01,670
I told my brother to watch the stove.

1812
02:01:01,837 --> 02:01:04,965
All day long the guy's been watching
helicopters and tomato sauce.

1813
02:01:06,425 --> 02:01:11,054
I had to drive over to Sandy's,
mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy.

1814
02:01:22,233 --> 02:01:25,068
Do you think you can come over here,
fuck me, and leave?

1815
02:01:25,444 --> 02:01:27,529
-Come on.
-You got someplace better to go?

1816
02:01:27,697 --> 02:01:30,198
Don't talk like that. Come on.

1817
02:01:30,533 --> 02:01:32,367
-You all right?
-Yeah, sure.

1818
02:01:32,535 --> 02:01:33,576
You believe me?

1819
02:01:34,954 --> 02:01:36,288
Do you believe me?

1820
02:01:36,664 --> 02:01:37,747
Do you believe me?

1821
02:01:40,084 --> 02:01:41,584
-That the last one?
-Yeah.

1822
02:01:51,429 --> 02:01:53,263
You lying son of a bitch. I hate you!

1823
02:02:00,479 --> 02:02:04,274
Please stop feeding the dog
from the table...

1824
02:02:04,442 --> 02:02:06,735
from the plate on top of it. Stop it.

1825
02:02:06,902 --> 02:02:09,237
-I have to.
-You don't have to.

1826
02:02:14,201 --> 02:02:15,660
I got to go home.

1827
02:02:17,705 --> 02:02:19,622
What do you mean, you got to go home?

1828
02:02:19,790 --> 02:02:21,082
I've been carrying this all day.

1829
02:02:21,250 --> 02:02:23,877
We got to start taping it to your leg.
We got to go soon.

1830
02:02:24,045 --> 02:02:25,962
I got to go home and get my hat.

1831
02:02:26,881 --> 02:02:29,090
Forget your fucking hat.
Are you kidding me?

1832
02:02:29,675 --> 02:02:32,427
So I need a trip to Rockaway
because you want your hat?

1833
02:02:32,595 --> 02:02:36,473
I need it, I got to have it.
It's my lucky hat. I never fly without it.

1834
02:02:36,849 --> 02:02:40,769
Lois, do you understand
what we are involved in here?

1835
02:02:41,228 --> 02:02:44,272
I don't care. I need my hat.
I won't fly without it.

1836
02:02:49,403 --> 02:02:52,989
What could I do if she insisted
I drive her home for her goddamn hat?

1837
02:02:53,157 --> 02:02:55,658
I hid the package in the kitchen
and went to take her home.

1838
02:02:55,826 --> 02:02:56,868
A hat?

1839
02:03:06,253 --> 02:03:07,420
What the fuck is this?

1840
02:03:07,838 --> 02:03:10,423
Police! Freeze! Don't you move,
you motherfucker...

1841
02:03:10,591 --> 02:03:13,593
or I'll blow your brains out.
Shut the car off slowly.

1842
02:03:17,598 --> 02:03:19,766
For a second, I thought I was dead.

1843
02:03:19,934 --> 02:03:22,268
But when I heard all the noise,
I knew they were cops.

1844
02:03:22,436 --> 02:03:23,978
Only cops talk that way.

1845
02:03:24,313 --> 02:03:25,480
Don't fucking move.

1846
02:03:25,648 --> 02:03:29,150
If they had been wiseguys,
I wouldn't have heard a thing.

1847
02:03:30,027 --> 02:03:31,653
I would have been dead.

1848
02:03:32,655 --> 02:03:34,114
Michael, lock the door!

1849
02:03:58,639 --> 02:04:01,307
Talk to me. When was the last time
you took a collar?

1850
02:04:01,725 --> 02:04:03,351
Fuckhead, I'm talking to you.

1851
02:04:03,519 --> 02:04:07,188
You don't want to say a fucking word,
don't. I don't really give a fuck.

1852
02:04:07,356 --> 02:04:11,401
You'll do 25 years. See how much
of a good guy you'll be then.

1853
02:04:11,569 --> 02:04:13,695
All day I thought the guys
in the helicopter...

1854
02:04:13,863 --> 02:04:18,366
were local cops busting my balls over
Lufthansa. They turned out to be narcs.

1855
02:04:18,534 --> 02:04:19,576
Just get the lawyer.

1856
02:04:19,743 --> 02:04:23,329
They'd been on me a month.
Phone taps, surveillance, everything.

1857
02:04:23,497 --> 02:04:26,166
You know the boys. All the pals are here.

1858
02:04:26,333 --> 02:04:29,252
You don't want to talk to me,
you'll have a problem all night.

1859
02:04:30,004 --> 02:04:33,965
Each one of these counts holds
25-to-life in New York State.

1860
02:04:34,133 --> 02:04:38,720
Twenty-five fucking years, pal.
I'll slap your fucking head inside out.

1861
02:04:39,472 --> 02:04:41,723
What, were you guys grocery shopping?

1862
02:04:43,142 --> 02:04:46,978
Are we going to make a cake?
You going to make a fucking cake?

1863
02:04:47,229 --> 02:04:49,397
You got anything good in there?

1864
02:04:51,108 --> 02:04:52,150
Is it good?

1865
02:04:57,239 --> 02:04:58,823
Bye-bye, dickhead.

1866
02:05:01,952 --> 02:05:03,453
See you in Attica, dick.

1867
02:05:03,996 --> 02:05:07,207
I spoke to Jimmy.
He offered to give me some money.

1868
02:05:07,875 --> 02:05:11,044
He just wants to know what's happening.
He just wants to talk to you.

1869
02:05:11,212 --> 02:05:12,587
Fuck Jimmy and his money.

1870
02:05:12,755 --> 02:05:15,965
I got to straighten out everything
with Paulie or I'm dead.

1871
02:05:16,884 --> 02:05:18,510
Then you're better off staying in here.

1872
02:05:18,677 --> 02:05:22,263
They could whack me in here as easy
as outside, maybe even easier.

1873
02:05:22,431 --> 02:05:24,057
They're afraid I'll rat them out.

1874
02:05:24,225 --> 02:05:27,852
People are already walking away from me.
I'm dead in here. You got to get me out.

1875
02:05:28,646 --> 02:05:33,274
Karen finally got her mother to put
her house up for my bail and I was out.

1876
02:05:33,442 --> 02:05:37,529
I remember I had this feeling
I would be killed right outside the jail.

1877
02:05:37,947 --> 02:05:41,115
I knew Paulie was still pissed at me,
and he's such a hothead.

1878
02:05:41,283 --> 02:05:43,034
And I was worried about Jimmy.

1879
02:05:43,202 --> 02:05:47,497
See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out
he was into drug deals with me...

1880
02:05:48,207 --> 02:05:51,251
Paulie would have Jimmy whacked
even before me.

1881
02:05:52,962 --> 02:05:54,587
This is the bad time.

1882
02:05:55,464 --> 02:05:57,715
I didn't feel safe until I got home.

1883
02:05:59,552 --> 02:06:03,471
Now my plan was to stay alive
long enough to sell off the dope...

1884
02:06:03,639 --> 02:06:08,059
the cops never found, then disappear
until I can get things straightened out.

1885
02:06:09,645 --> 02:06:10,687
Fuck!

1886
02:06:10,854 --> 02:06:14,607
-Where's the stuff I left, Karen?
-I flushed it down the toilet.

1887
02:06:16,318 --> 02:06:17,360
You what?

1888
02:06:17,987 --> 02:06:20,488
What was I supposed to do?
They were all over the house.

1889
02:06:20,656 --> 02:06:24,951
That was worth $60,000!
I need that money! That's all we got!

1890
02:06:25,119 --> 02:06:27,579
What was I supposed to do?
They had a search warrant!

1891
02:06:27,746 --> 02:06:32,166
That's all the money we had! I was
depending on that! Why did you do that?

1892
02:06:32,710 --> 02:06:35,503
I had to. They were going to find it!

1893
02:06:35,671 --> 02:06:39,674
-They would have never found it!
-They would have, I swear to you!

1894
02:06:41,093 --> 02:06:42,760
They would've found it!

1895
02:06:44,179 --> 02:06:45,597
Why did you do that?

1896
02:06:45,764 --> 02:06:49,350
-They would have found it.
-Why did you do that, Karen?

1897
02:06:50,603 --> 02:06:52,520
Oh, my God!

1898
02:06:53,022 --> 02:06:55,940
- I had to do it.
- Oh, my God.

1899
02:07:32,061 --> 02:07:34,020
Paulie, I'm really sorry.

1900
02:07:36,690 --> 02:07:39,442
I don't know what else to say.
I know I fucked up.

1901
02:07:39,610 --> 02:07:41,277
Yeah, you fucked up.

1902
02:07:45,032 --> 02:07:46,866
But I'm all right now.

1903
02:07:48,410 --> 02:07:52,789
I can be trusted now. I'm clean.
On my kids, I'm clean.

1904
02:07:52,956 --> 02:07:55,166
You looked in my eyes and lied to me.

1905
02:07:56,460 --> 02:07:58,586
You treated me like a fucking jerk.

1906
02:07:59,213 --> 02:08:00,713
Like I was never nothing to you.

1907
02:08:00,881 --> 02:08:03,549
After what you said,
I couldn't come to you.

1908
02:08:04,885 --> 02:08:07,261
You know, I was ashamed.

1909
02:08:10,265 --> 02:08:12,266
I'm ashamed now.

1910
02:08:15,604 --> 02:08:17,772
But I got nowhere else to go, Paulie.

1911
02:08:20,984 --> 02:08:25,279
You're all I've got.
And I really need your help. I really do.

1912
02:08:31,495 --> 02:08:32,578
Take this.

1913
02:08:47,636 --> 02:08:49,762
And now I've got to turn my back on you.

1914
02:09:00,149 --> 02:09:01,816
$3,200.

1915
02:09:02,401 --> 02:09:06,404
That's what he gave me.
$3,200 for a lifetime.

1916
02:09:07,322 --> 02:09:09,532
It wasn't even enough
to pay for the coffin.

1917
02:09:09,742 --> 02:09:11,826
- We got to get out.
- I don't want to run.

1918
02:09:11,994 --> 02:09:16,330
I don't want to. Am I supposed to pick up
and leave everything? Go hiding?

1919
02:09:16,749 --> 02:09:19,250
I don't want to do that.
Is that what you want?

1920
02:09:19,418 --> 02:09:21,586
If we stay around here, we're dead.

1921
02:09:22,337 --> 02:09:24,172
You got it? We're dead.

1922
02:09:24,798 --> 02:09:25,840
They're right.

1923
02:09:26,425 --> 02:09:29,385
You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.

1924
02:09:32,973 --> 02:09:34,724
How's he doing? Busting his balls or what?

1925
02:09:34,892 --> 02:09:36,017
He's okay.

1926
02:09:37,186 --> 02:09:38,436
They sobered him up.

1927
02:09:38,937 --> 02:09:40,855
Good. Very good. Glad to hear it.

1928
02:09:45,027 --> 02:09:47,320
You know what kind of questions
they're asking him?

1929
02:09:47,488 --> 02:09:49,071
Jimmy, I don't know.

1930
02:09:50,157 --> 02:09:53,701
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money....

1931
02:09:54,244 --> 02:09:56,913
The girls are old enough
to read the newspapers.

1932
02:09:57,080 --> 02:09:59,040
Tell him he's got to call me. Okay?

1933
02:09:59,917 --> 02:10:03,544
As soon as you talk to him,
he's got to call me. It's important.

1934
02:10:03,879 --> 02:10:07,423
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.

1935
02:10:07,591 --> 02:10:10,718
-Take this. It's a couple thousand.
-Thanks, Jimmy.

1936
02:10:10,969 --> 02:10:13,054
Don't worry, everything will be all right.

1937
02:10:13,222 --> 02:10:16,390
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?

1938
02:10:16,642 --> 02:10:18,518
Pick out a few for yourself.

1939
02:10:19,311 --> 02:10:20,978
-For my mom.
-Yeah, whatever.

1940
02:10:21,396 --> 02:10:24,065
No. It's over here.
In the store on the corner.

1941
02:10:24,233 --> 02:10:26,651
It's swag, so I got it down on the corner.

1942
02:10:32,616 --> 02:10:34,116
Go ahead, sweetheart, I'll see you.

1943
02:10:34,576 --> 02:10:36,285
-Thanks, Jimmy.
-Don't worry.

1944
02:10:36,495 --> 02:10:39,080
-I'll try.
-Don't forget, he's got to call me.

1945
02:10:41,708 --> 02:10:43,918
-Over here?
-Right down there.

1946
02:10:58,934 --> 02:11:00,560
It's over there, on the corner.

1947
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:02,562
Right there.

1948
02:11:24,626 --> 02:11:26,210
Shh, shh, shh.

1949
02:11:36,763 --> 02:11:38,890
No, go ahead. It's right in there.

1950
02:11:39,057 --> 02:11:41,142
No, Jimmy. I'm in a hurry!

1951
02:11:41,476 --> 02:11:44,270
My mom's watching the kids!
I got to get home!

1952
02:11:44,438 --> 02:11:45,980
I'll come back later!

1953
02:12:08,420 --> 02:12:10,046
Karen. Karen!

1954
02:12:14,551 --> 02:12:15,801
What happened?

1955
02:12:17,012 --> 02:12:18,471
Nothing.

1956
02:12:18,639 --> 02:12:20,514
-What happened?
-I just got scared.

1957
02:12:24,019 --> 02:12:25,186
Got the keys?

1958
02:12:26,939 --> 02:12:30,566
-What happened, Karen?
-I just got scared. It's okay.

1959
02:12:30,734 --> 02:12:32,360
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

1960
02:12:39,242 --> 02:12:43,829
If you're part of a crew, nobody
ever tells you they're going to kill you.

1961
02:12:44,373 --> 02:12:46,123
It doesn't happen that way.

1962
02:12:46,291 --> 02:12:49,710
There aren't any arguments
or curses like in the movies.

1963
02:12:49,878 --> 02:12:53,965
Your murderers come with smiles.
They come as your friends.

1964
02:12:54,132 --> 02:12:56,175
People who cared for you all your life.

1965
02:12:56,343 --> 02:13:00,721
They always seem to come when you're
weakest and most in need of their help.

1966
02:13:01,056 --> 02:13:04,308
So I met Jimmy in a crowded place
we both knew.

1967
02:13:04,685 --> 02:13:08,688
I got there 15 minutes early,
and Jimmy was already there.

1968
02:13:09,106 --> 02:13:13,526
He took the booth near the window
so he could see everyone who drove up.

1969
02:13:13,860 --> 02:13:16,237
He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.

1970
02:13:16,655 --> 02:13:19,532
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing.

1971
02:13:20,575 --> 02:13:23,577
On the surface,
everything was supposed to be fine.

1972
02:13:23,745 --> 02:13:26,080
We were supposed to be discussing
my case.

1973
02:13:26,248 --> 02:13:31,210
But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying
to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.

1974
02:13:32,879 --> 02:13:36,590
I been telling you your whole life,
don't talk on the phone.

1975
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:38,592
Now you understand?

1976
02:13:41,263 --> 02:13:44,598
It's going to be okay.
You got a good chance to beat the case.

1977
02:13:47,769 --> 02:13:52,064
You know that kid from the city
we were talking about? You know?

1978
02:13:54,651 --> 02:13:58,654
The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon as
he got pinched, he ratted on everybody.

1979
02:14:01,450 --> 02:14:03,367
I know where he is. He's hiding now.

1980
02:14:05,287 --> 02:14:06,620
Know what I'm saying?

1981
02:14:11,626 --> 02:14:14,795
Would you have a problem going
with Anthony to take care of that?

1982
02:14:15,380 --> 02:14:16,964
Mm-mm.

1983
02:14:17,883 --> 02:14:19,133
No, not at all.

1984
02:14:20,761 --> 02:14:22,344
That way they got nothing.

1985
02:14:31,188 --> 02:14:33,939
Jimmy had never asked me
to whack somebody before.

1986
02:14:34,399 --> 02:14:38,069
But now he's asking me to go to Florida
and do a hit with Anthony.

1987
02:14:45,619 --> 02:14:48,954
That's when I knew I would never
have come back from Florida alive.

1988
02:15:03,345 --> 02:15:06,639
Whenever you move me,
I asked once and I'll tell you again...

1989
02:15:06,807 --> 02:15:08,641
I don't want to go any place cold.

1990
02:15:09,643 --> 02:15:11,811
You don't have a choice in that matter.

1991
02:15:12,187 --> 02:15:14,730
Come on. Whoever fucking controls it...

1992
02:15:15,524 --> 02:15:18,192
just no place cold. Do that for me.
I'm trying to--

1993
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:20,069
He's bronchial, that's why.

1994
02:15:20,237 --> 02:15:22,947
If he's legitimately bronchial,
we'll consider that.

1995
02:15:23,115 --> 02:15:25,199
I'd like to go someplace not cold.

1996
02:15:25,367 --> 02:15:29,078
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?

1997
02:15:30,038 --> 02:15:31,080
What about them?

1998
02:15:31,248 --> 02:15:33,833
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?

1999
02:15:35,085 --> 02:15:37,294
Don't I have some kind of contact
with them?

2000
02:15:38,171 --> 02:15:39,213
No.

2001
02:15:40,340 --> 02:15:43,676
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me that...

2002
02:15:44,052 --> 02:15:48,055
God forbid something happens to my
parents, they get sick, I can't see them?

2003
02:15:48,223 --> 02:15:51,225
Maybe something can be worked out
if they're sick...

2004
02:15:51,726 --> 02:15:53,894
if there's extraordinary circumstances--

2005
02:15:54,062 --> 02:15:56,897
I can't do this. I can't do this, Henry.

2006
02:15:58,024 --> 02:15:59,775
I can't leave my parents.

2007
02:16:01,027 --> 02:16:03,237
Excuse me, Karen, I told you before.

2008
02:16:04,489 --> 02:16:07,491
I'm not going to do this
unless you and the kids come with me.

2009
02:16:09,828 --> 02:16:11,495
I can't do it without you.

2010
02:16:11,913 --> 02:16:16,000
So, you do whatever, but...that's it.

2011
02:16:17,544 --> 02:16:20,004
-You need Henry, not me, right?
-That's right.

2012
02:16:20,422 --> 02:16:22,882
Frankly, I don't care
whether you go or not.

2013
02:16:23,216 --> 02:16:26,594
If it'll make him a better witness,
I'd like you to be with him.

2014
02:16:26,761 --> 02:16:28,345
They want Henry, not me.

2015
02:16:28,513 --> 02:16:31,599
Henry'll be in the protection program.
They can't get to him.

2016
02:16:32,517 --> 02:16:35,769
They can only get to him
by getting to you or your kids.

2017
02:16:35,937 --> 02:16:38,522
If he goes into the program,
you're in danger--

2018
02:16:38,690 --> 02:16:41,066
-I don't know anything.
-Don't give me...

2019
02:16:41,234 --> 02:16:42,735
the babe-in-the-woods routine.

2020
02:16:42,903 --> 02:16:47,281
I've listened to those wiretaps,
and I've heard you talk about cocaine.

2021
02:16:47,449 --> 02:16:50,784
Conversation after conversation
you talked to Henry on the phone.

2022
02:16:55,999 --> 02:16:58,083
It doesn't matter.
Whether he goes to jail...

2023
02:16:58,251 --> 02:17:01,545
or stays on the streets and beats the case,
he's a dead man.

2024
02:17:02,297 --> 02:17:04,006
He knows it and you know it.

2025
02:17:05,634 --> 02:17:07,343
What about the kids and school?

2026
02:17:07,510 --> 02:17:09,803
Will they get left back?
I mean, what goes on?

2027
02:17:10,138 --> 02:17:12,556
Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.

2028
02:17:12,724 --> 02:17:15,184
Whoever sold you those suits
had a sense of humor.

2029
02:17:15,352 --> 02:17:18,437
What it comes down to is
we're your only salvation.

2030
02:17:19,272 --> 02:17:22,691
We'll save your life and his life,
and we'll keep you out of jail.

2031
02:17:26,947 --> 02:17:29,573
This morning you told the jury
about your background.

2032
02:17:29,741 --> 02:17:31,575
It was easy for us to disappear.

2033
02:17:32,118 --> 02:17:34,245
My house
was in my mother-in-law's name.

2034
02:17:34,412 --> 02:17:36,372
My cars were registered to my wife.

2035
02:17:36,539 --> 02:17:40,000
My Social Security cards
and driver's licenses were phonies.

2036
02:17:40,168 --> 02:17:42,503
I never voted or paid taxes.

2037
02:17:43,088 --> 02:17:47,549
My birth certificate and arrest sheet was
all you'd ever have to know I was alive.

2038
02:17:47,717 --> 02:17:49,635
Do you see him here in this courtroom?

2039
02:17:49,803 --> 02:17:50,844
Yes.

2040
02:17:51,012 --> 02:17:53,097
Will you please point him out for the jury?

2041
02:17:55,684 --> 02:18:00,312
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, James Conway.

2042
02:18:01,439 --> 02:18:04,525
Do you also know a man
named Paul Cicero?

2043
02:18:04,859 --> 02:18:06,860
-Do you see him in the courtroom?
-Yes.

2044
02:18:07,445 --> 02:18:09,363
Can you point him out for the jury?

2045
02:18:11,324 --> 02:18:15,411
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, Paul Cicero.

2046
02:18:16,746 --> 02:18:18,455
Your Honor, I have a document....

2047
02:18:18,623 --> 02:18:21,041
The hardest thing was leaving the life.

2048
02:18:21,876 --> 02:18:23,335
I still love the life.

2049
02:18:23,712 --> 02:18:25,629
We were treated like movie stars
with muscle.

2050
02:18:25,797 --> 02:18:28,048
We had it all, just for the asking.

2051
02:18:28,216 --> 02:18:31,552
Our wives, mothers, kids,
everybody rode along.

2052
02:18:31,886 --> 02:18:35,055
I had paper bags filled with jewelry
stashed in the kitchen.

2053
02:18:35,223 --> 02:18:37,474
I had a sugar bowl full of coke
next to the bed.

2054
02:18:37,642 --> 02:18:41,437
People call them rats because rats do
anything to survive. Isn't that right?

2055
02:18:41,604 --> 02:18:43,647
- Objection!
- Objection sustained.

2056
02:18:43,815 --> 02:18:47,401
-I know nothing about being a rat.
-You know everything about it.

2057
02:18:47,736 --> 02:18:49,445
Objection, Your Honor.
In view of the violence....

2058
02:18:49,612 --> 02:18:51,739
Anything I wanted was a phone call away.

2059
02:18:51,906 --> 02:18:55,326
Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideout flats
all over the city.

2060
02:18:55,493 --> 02:18:57,995
I'd bet $20,000, $30,000
over a weekend...

2061
02:18:58,163 --> 02:19:02,207
then blow the winnings in a week
or go to the sharks to pay the bookies.

2062
02:19:02,375 --> 02:19:03,709
It didn't matter.

2063
02:19:04,252 --> 02:19:09,131
It didn't mean anything. When I was broke
I would go out and rob some more.

2064
02:19:09,549 --> 02:19:10,924
We ran everything.

2065
02:19:11,468 --> 02:19:15,763
We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.

2066
02:19:16,014 --> 02:19:19,433
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.

2067
02:19:21,561 --> 02:19:23,062
And now it's all over.

2068
02:19:23,980 --> 02:19:25,439
That's the hardest part.

2069
02:19:26,441 --> 02:19:28,067
Today everything is different.

2070
02:19:28,234 --> 02:19:32,404
There's no action.
I have to wait around like everyone else.

2071
02:19:32,781 --> 02:19:34,573
Can't even get decent food.

2072
02:19:35,325 --> 02:19:38,452
After I got here I ordered spaghetti
with marinara sauce...

2073
02:19:38,620 --> 02:19:40,454
and I got egg noodles and ketchup.

2074
02:19:41,289 --> 02:19:42,790
I'm an average nobody.

2075
02:19:44,167 --> 02:19:46,960
I get to live the rest of my life
like a schnook.
