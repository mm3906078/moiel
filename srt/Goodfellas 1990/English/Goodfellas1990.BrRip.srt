1
00:01:00,926 --> 00:01:02,564
What the fuck is that?

2
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:04,361
Jimmy?

3
00:01:04,646 --> 00:01:06,398
What's up?
Did I hit something?

4
00:01:06,486 --> 00:01:08,078
What the fuck is that?

5
00:01:09,086 --> 00:01:10,644
Maybe you got a flat?

6
00:01:12,326 --> 00:01:13,361
No.

7
00:01:15,206 --> 00:01:17,083
What the fuck?
You better pull over and see.

8
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:45,356
He's still alive. You fucking piece of shit!

9
00:01:45,446 --> 00:01:48,165
Die, you motherfucker! Look at me!

10
00:01:57,246 --> 00:02:01,034
 As far back as I can remember,
I always wanted to be a gangster.

11
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:40,435
 To me...

12
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:44,758
 being a gangster was better than
being president of the United States.

13
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:51,242
 Even before I first wandered
into the cabstand for an after school job...

14
00:02:51,326 --> 00:02:53,396
 I knew I wanted to be a part of them.

15
00:02:53,486 --> 00:02:55,875
 It was there that I knew I belonged.

16
00:02:55,966 --> 00:03:00,357
 To me, it meant being somebody
in a neighborhood full of nobodies.

17
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:03,438
 They weren't like anybody else.
They did whatever they wanted.

18
00:03:03,526 --> 00:03:07,075
 They double parked in front of a hydrant,
nobody ever gave them a ticket.

19
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,475
 In the summer,
when they played cards all night...

20
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:11,602
 nobody ever called the cops.

21
00:03:23,126 --> 00:03:25,082
Tony Stacks. How are you?

22
00:03:26,326 --> 00:03:27,805
 Tuddy Cicero.

23
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:30,081
Could this be the Canarsie Kid?

24
00:03:30,686 --> 00:03:32,165
 How are you?
 Good.

25
00:03:33,406 --> 00:03:34,521
 Tuddy.

26
00:03:35,446 --> 00:03:38,404
 Tuddy ran the cabstand
and the Bella Vista Pizzeria...

27
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:42,957
 and other places for his brother, Paul,
who was the boss of the neighborhood.

28
00:03:47,366 --> 00:03:49,561
 Paulie might have moved slow...

29
00:03:51,926 --> 00:03:55,760
 but it was only because Paulie
didn't have to move for anybody.

30
00:04:00,246 --> 00:04:01,838
 It's your fault.
 You started it.

31
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:03,917
I started it? It's your fault.

32
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:08,284
 At first my parents loved that I found
a job across the street from the house.

33
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:12,961
 My father, who was Irish,
was sent to work at the age of 11.

34
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:15,043
 He liked that I got myself a job.

35
00:04:15,126 --> 00:04:18,516
 He always used to say
that American kids were spoiled lazy.

36
00:04:20,246 --> 00:04:21,838
 Bye, Dad.
 Bye.

37
00:04:22,286 --> 00:04:23,605
See you, Mikey.

38
00:04:23,686 --> 00:04:24,914
Bye, Henry.

39
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:26,997
Henry! Watch how you cross!

40
00:04:27,086 --> 00:04:28,519
Bring back milk!

41
00:04:28,606 --> 00:04:31,678
 My mother was happy after
she found out that the Ciceros...

42
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:35,236
 came from the same part of Sicily
as she did. To my mother...

43
00:04:35,326 --> 00:04:37,999
 that was the answer to all her prayers.

44
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,835
 I was the luckiest kid in the world.

45
00:04:41,926 --> 00:04:44,724
 I could go anywhere, I could do anything.

46
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:47,366
 I knew everybody,
and everybody knew me.

47
00:04:47,766 --> 00:04:50,519
 Wiseguys would pull up
and Tuddy would toss me their keys...

48
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:52,358
 and let me park their Cadillacs.

49
00:04:52,446 --> 00:04:55,961
 Here I am, this little kid,
I can't even see over the steering wheel...

50
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,162
 and I'm parking Cadillacs.

51
00:05:01,246 --> 00:05:03,282
 But it wasn't too long...

52
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:07,120
 before my parents changed
their minds about my job at the cabstand.

53
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:08,719
For your mother and sister.

54
00:05:08,806 --> 00:05:12,242
 For them, the cabstand was supposed
to be a part time job. But for me...

55
00:05:12,326 --> 00:05:14,317
 it was definitely full time.

56
00:05:14,406 --> 00:05:16,317
 That's all I wanted to do.

57
00:05:16,406 --> 00:05:20,479
 People like my father could never
understand, but I was a part of something.

58
00:05:20,566 --> 00:05:23,285
 I belonged. I was treated like a grown up.

59
00:05:24,086 --> 00:05:25,485
Tell him 519.

60
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,637
 Every day I was learning to score.

61
00:05:27,726 --> 00:05:30,160
 A dollar here, a dollar there.

62
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,123
 I was living in a fantasy.

63
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:36,079
Did you have a good day at school?

64
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,997
 My father was always pissed off.

65
00:05:38,086 --> 00:05:40,202
 Pissed that he made such lousy money...

66
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:43,164
 pissed that my kid brother Michael
was in a wheelchair.

67
00:05:43,246 --> 00:05:47,319
 He was pissed that there were seven of us
living in such a tiny house.

68
00:05:47,726 --> 00:05:49,364
Tell me about this.

69
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,722
It's a letter from school.

70
00:05:52,246 --> 00:05:54,919
It says you haven't been there in months.

71
00:05:56,126 --> 00:05:57,400
In months!

72
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:00,525
You're a bum !

73
00:06:00,686 --> 00:06:02,722
Want to grow up to be a bum?

74
00:06:04,206 --> 00:06:08,245
 After a while, he was mostly pissed
because I hung around the cabstand.

75
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,237
 He knew what went on at that cabstand.

76
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:14,797
 Every once in a while, I'd have to take
a beating. But by then, I didn't care.

77
00:06:15,086 --> 00:06:16,724
 The way I saw it...

78
00:06:17,046 --> 00:06:19,606
 everybody takes a beating sometime.

79
00:06:20,726 --> 00:06:24,401
 I can't make any more deliveries.
 What? You'll fuck everything up.

80
00:06:24,486 --> 00:06:26,522
My dad says he'll kill me. Look.

81
00:06:26,606 --> 00:06:28,005
Come on with me.

82
00:06:28,246 --> 00:06:30,077
 Is that him, kid?
 No.

83
00:06:30,726 --> 00:06:32,398
 How about him?
 No.

84
00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:36,237
 That's the guy.
 Get him.

85
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:39,280
Excuse me.

86
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,960
 Scumbag.
 Come here, you piece of shit.

87
00:06:50,406 --> 00:06:52,522
 Know this kid?
 Yeah.

88
00:06:52,606 --> 00:06:54,164
 Know where he lives?
 Yeah.

89
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:56,476
 You deliver mail to his house?
 Yeah.

90
00:06:56,566 --> 00:07:00,241
From now on, any letter from that school
to his house comes directly here.

91
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:01,475
 Understand?
 Yeah.

92
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:04,239
Another letter from that school
goes to that kid's house...

93
00:07:04,326 --> 00:07:06,794
in the fucking oven you'll go, head first.

94
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:11,084
 That was it. No more letters from
truant officers. No letters from school.

95
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,202
 In fact, no more letters from anybody.

96
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:16,835
 Finally after a few weeks, my mother
went to the post office to complain.

97
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:18,924
 How could I go to school after that...

98
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:22,999
 and pledge allegiance to the flag
and sit through good government bullshit?

99
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:29,038
 Paulie hated phones.
He wouldn't have one in his house.

100
00:07:29,126 --> 00:07:31,720
Mickey called. Want me to call him back?

101
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:33,678
All right, make the call.

102
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:37,315
 He got all his calls second hand.
Then you'd have to call the people back...

103
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:38,441
 from an outside phone.

104
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:40,915
Got a nickel? Get him on the phone.

105
00:07:41,646 --> 00:07:46,197
 There were guys, that's all they did
all day, was take care of Paulie's calls.

106
00:07:55,446 --> 00:07:59,644
 For a guy who moved all day long,
Paulie didn't talk to six people.

107
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:02,684
 If there was a union problem
or, say, a beef in the numbers...

108
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:06,156
 only the top guys could meet
with Paulie to discuss the problem.

109
00:08:06,246 --> 00:08:09,397
 Everything was one on one.
Paulie hated conferences.

110
00:08:10,126 --> 00:08:12,515
 He didn't want anybody
hearing what he said...

111
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:15,882
 and he didn't want anybody listening
to what he was being told.

112
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:20,084
 Hundreds of guys depended on Paulie,
he got a piece of everything they made.

113
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,398
 It was a tribute, like in the old country,
except they were doing it in America.

114
00:08:24,486 --> 00:08:28,843
 All they got from Paulie was protection
from other guys looking to rip them off.

115
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:32,714
 That's what it's all about. That's what
the FBI could never understand.

116
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,282
 What Paulie and the Organization does...

117
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:39,154
 is offer protection for people
who can't go to the cops. That's it.

118
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:43,685
 That's all it is. They're like
the police department for wiseguys.

119
00:08:53,086 --> 00:08:57,045
 People looked at me differently,
and they knew I was with somebody.

120
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:01,205
 I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery
on Sunday mornings for fresh bread.

121
00:09:01,286 --> 00:09:02,685
 The owner knew who I was with...

122
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:06,281
 and he'd come from around the counter.
No matter how many were waiting...

123
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:08,277
 I was taken care of first.

124
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:10,835
 Our neighbors didn't park
in our driveway anymore...

125
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:13,486
 even though we didn't have a car. At 13...

126
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:16,399
 I was making more money than most
of the grown ups around.

127
00:09:16,486 --> 00:09:19,523
 I had more money than I could spend.
I had it all.

128
00:09:29,246 --> 00:09:33,797
 One day, some neighborhood kids carried
my mother's groceries all the way home.

129
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:35,239
 You know why?

130
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:37,798
 It was out of respect.

131
00:09:39,486 --> 00:09:41,477
Hi, Mom, what do you think?

132
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:45,640
 Look at my shoes, aren't they great?
 My God.

133
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,724
You look like a gangster.

134
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:49,478
They shot me. Help!

135
00:09:51,886 --> 00:09:53,638
Henry, shut the door.

136
00:09:54,606 --> 00:09:57,757
 That was the first time
I had ever seen anyone shot.

137
00:09:58,486 --> 00:10:00,636
Can't have that in here. Jesus Christ!

138
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,637
I can't have that in this joint.

139
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:04,444
 I remember feeling bad about the guy...

140
00:10:04,526 --> 00:10:07,563
 but I also remember feeling
that maybe Tuddy was right.

141
00:10:07,846 --> 00:10:10,440
 I knew Paulie didn't want
anybody dying in the building.

142
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:14,235
You're a real jerk. You wasted
eight fucking aprons on this guy.

143
00:10:14,326 --> 00:10:17,477
What the hell's wrong with you?
I got to toughen this kid up.

144
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:38,163
 It was a glorious time.

145
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:41,554
 And wiseguys were all over the place.

146
00:10:42,446 --> 00:10:45,358
 It was before Apalachin
and before Crazy Joe...

147
00:10:45,446 --> 00:10:48,244
 decided to take on a boss and start a war.

148
00:10:48,886 --> 00:10:50,922
 It was when I met the world.

149
00:10:51,006 --> 00:10:53,645
 And it was when I first met
Jimmy Conway.

150
00:10:54,806 --> 00:10:58,116
 He couldn't have been more than 28 or 29
at the time...

151
00:10:58,206 --> 00:11:00,117
 but he was already a legend.

152
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:04,119
 He'd walk in the door and everybody
who worked the room just went wild.

153
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:06,766
 He'd give the doorman $100
just for opening the door.

154
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:10,680
 He'd give hundreds to the dealers
and the guys who ran the games.

155
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:13,678
 The bartender got $100
just for keeping the ice cubes cold.

156
00:11:13,766 --> 00:11:16,724
The Irishman is here
to take all you guineas' money.

157
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,440
 Want a drink?
 Give me a 7 and 7.

158
00:11:29,326 --> 00:11:32,523
 I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.
 How you doing?

159
00:11:34,846 --> 00:11:37,485
 Thank you.
 Keep them coming.

160
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:40,524
 Jimmy was one of the most
feared guys in the city.

161
00:11:40,606 --> 00:11:42,244
 He was first locked up at 11...

162
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:45,363
 and he was doing hits
for mob bosses when he was 16.

163
00:11:45,446 --> 00:11:48,165
 See, hits never bothered Jimmy.
It was business.

164
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:50,636
 But what Jimmy really loved to do...

165
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:52,717
 what he really loved to do was steal.

166
00:11:52,806 --> 00:11:55,001
 He actually enjoyed it.

167
00:11:55,086 --> 00:11:58,874
 Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted
for the bad guys in the movies.

168
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:01,238
Give me your wallet.

169
00:12:04,126 --> 00:12:07,163
You might know who we are,
but we know who you are. Understand?

170
00:12:07,246 --> 00:12:09,635
 He was one of
the city's biggest hijackers...

171
00:12:09,726 --> 00:12:13,241
 of booze, cigarettes, razor blades,
shrimp and lobsters.

172
00:12:13,326 --> 00:12:16,204
 Shrimp and lobsters were best.
They went really fast.

173
00:12:16,286 --> 00:12:20,074
 Almost all of them were gimmies.
They just gave it up, no problem.

174
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,838
 They called him Jimmy the Gent.

175
00:12:21,926 --> 00:12:23,075
Help the lady.

176
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,202
 Drivers loved him.
They used to tip him off...

177
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,801
 about the really good loads.
Of course, everybody got a piece.

178
00:12:28,886 --> 00:12:30,956
Thanks, I'll be back for the rest later.

179
00:12:31,046 --> 00:12:32,525
Okay, see you later.

180
00:12:34,886 --> 00:12:36,444
Henry, come here.

181
00:12:37,326 --> 00:12:39,317
 Say hello to Tommy.
 How're you doing, Henry?

182
00:12:39,406 --> 00:12:41,397
You're gonna be working together, okay?

183
00:12:41,486 --> 00:12:43,158
Help him. Go ahead.

184
00:12:43,526 --> 00:12:45,596
Jimmy, you got anything good?

185
00:12:45,686 --> 00:12:49,759
 And when the cops assigned a whole
army to stop Jimmy, what did he do?

186
00:12:49,846 --> 00:12:50,915
How're you doing?

187
00:12:51,006 --> 00:12:52,758
 He made them partners.

188
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:54,404
I'd complain, but who'd listen?

189
00:12:54,846 --> 00:12:56,325
 One Pall Mall.
 There you go.

190
00:12:56,406 --> 00:12:58,522
 What do you need?
 Two Luckies.

191
00:12:58,606 --> 00:13:00,483
 Here you go, Henry.
 Thanks a lot.

192
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:01,635
What do you need?

193
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:04,365
 One Pall Mall.
 One Pall Mall, here you go.

194
00:13:04,446 --> 00:13:06,084
 What are you doing?
 It's all right.

195
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:09,283
 You have permission from your mother?
 How many cartons you need?

196
00:13:09,366 --> 00:13:12,199
 Where'd you get the cigarettes?
 Get him out of here.

197
00:13:12,286 --> 00:13:14,038
 It's okay.
 It's not okay.

198
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,277
 You don't understand.
 You don't understand. Store's closed.

199
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,723
 Henry got pinched.
 Where?

200
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:25,603
By the factory, selling cigarettes.

201
00:13:25,686 --> 00:13:29,395
 Henry Hill. The People of
the State of New York vs. Henry Hill.

202
00:13:29,646 --> 00:13:32,365
Docket number 704162.

203
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:35,558
Yes, sir. That's me.

204
00:13:38,286 --> 00:13:40,925
Just stand there. Now stay there.

205
00:13:47,086 --> 00:13:48,724
Counselor, proceed.

206
00:13:51,806 --> 00:13:53,319
Congratulations.

207
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:55,523
Here's your graduation present.

208
00:13:55,606 --> 00:13:58,518
 What for? I got pinched.
 Everyone does, but you did it right.

209
00:13:58,606 --> 00:14:00,676
You told them nothing,
and they got nothing.

210
00:14:00,766 --> 00:14:03,838
 I thought you'd be mad.
 I'm not mad, I'm proud of you.

211
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:08,124
You took your first pinch like a man
and learned the two greatest things in life.

212
00:14:08,206 --> 00:14:10,436
 What?
 Look at me.

213
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,202
Never rat on your friends...

214
00:14:13,326 --> 00:14:15,556
and always keep your mouth shut.

215
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,885
Here he is.

216
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:22,163
You broke your cherry.

217
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:30,558
Congratulations!

218
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:06,963
 By the time I grew up,
there was $30 billion a year in cargo...

219
00:15:07,046 --> 00:15:08,798
 moving through Idlewild Airport...

220
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:11,878
 and believe me,
we tried to steal every bit of it.

221
00:15:12,206 --> 00:15:14,720
 See, you gotta understand,
we grew up near the airport.

222
00:15:14,806 --> 00:15:16,364
 It belonged to Paulie.

223
00:15:16,446 --> 00:15:19,119
 We had friends and relatives
who worked all over the place.

224
00:15:19,206 --> 00:15:22,835
 They would tip us off about
what was coming in and moving out.

225
00:15:23,246 --> 00:15:25,999
 If any truckers or airlines gave us trouble...

226
00:15:26,086 --> 00:15:30,079
 Paulie had the union people scare them
with a strike. It was beautiful.

227
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,875
 It was a bigger moneymaker than numbers
and Jimmy was in charge of it all.

228
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,719
 Whenever we needed money,
we'd rob the airport.

229
00:15:36,806 --> 00:15:39,195
 To us, it was better than Citibank.

230
00:15:49,806 --> 00:15:52,161
You got a phone? Come on!

231
00:15:52,246 --> 00:15:55,841
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you believe that shit?

232
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:02,238
 There was Jimmy...

233
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:04,045
 and Tommy and me.

234
00:16:04,126 --> 00:16:05,957
 And there was Anthony Stabile.

235
00:16:06,046 --> 00:16:07,559
How're you doing?

236
00:16:07,686 --> 00:16:09,199
 Frankie Carbone.

237
00:16:11,206 --> 00:16:14,164
 And then there was Mo Black's brother,
Fat Andy.

238
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:17,117
 And his guys, Frankie the Wop.

239
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:20,798
 Freddy No Nose.

240
00:16:22,246 --> 00:16:26,080
 And then there was Pete the Killer,
who was Sally Balls'brother.

241
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,157
 Then you had Nickey Eyes...

242
00:16:31,326 --> 00:16:33,123
 and Mikey Franzese.

243
00:16:33,206 --> 00:16:34,639
That guy, I wanna see him.

244
00:16:34,726 --> 00:16:38,275
 Jimmy Two Times, who got that nickname
because he said everything twice.

245
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:40,880
I'm gonna go get the papers,
get the papers.

246
00:16:52,406 --> 00:16:56,035
What is this? Coats?
Henry, I need suits, not coats.

247
00:16:56,526 --> 00:16:58,005
Suits are coming Thursday.

248
00:16:58,086 --> 00:17:00,964
But it's the middle of summer.
What'll I do with fur coats?

249
00:17:01,046 --> 00:17:03,162
You don't want furs? I'll take them away.

250
00:17:03,246 --> 00:17:07,524
No, I want them. We'll hang them
in the freezer with the meat. How's that?

251
00:17:07,606 --> 00:17:10,166
 For us, to live any other way was nuts.

252
00:17:10,726 --> 00:17:14,480
 To us, those goody good people who
worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks...

253
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:18,479
 and took the subway to work every day
and worried about bills, were dead.

254
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:21,274
 They were suckers. They had no balls.

255
00:17:21,646 --> 00:17:23,921
 If we wanted something, we just took it.

256
00:17:24,006 --> 00:17:28,363
 If anyone complained twice, they got hit
so bad they never complained again.

257
00:17:28,446 --> 00:17:31,836
 It was just all routine.
You didn't even think about it.

258
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:37,284
Frankie, what the fuck does 520
have to do with 469?

259
00:17:37,366 --> 00:17:38,765
I can't believe this guy.

260
00:17:38,846 --> 00:17:42,680
520 ain't even close to 469.
What's that got to do with anything?

261
00:17:46,086 --> 00:17:47,519
Piece of cake. It's all there.

262
00:17:47,606 --> 00:17:50,837
Don't worry about the alarms.
I just gotta find a way to get the key.

263
00:17:50,926 --> 00:17:53,360
 No problem, right?
 I'll take care of it.

264
00:18:00,406 --> 00:18:03,842
 Tell him what you were telling me.
 Too good to be true.

265
00:18:04,806 --> 00:18:08,321
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money coming in.

266
00:18:09,446 --> 00:18:11,880
Tourists and American servicemen
change their money...

267
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,922
into French money and send it back here.

268
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:15,997
 Calm down.
 It's beautiful.

269
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:19,558
It's totally untraceable. Okay?

270
00:18:19,646 --> 00:18:22,285
The only problem is getting a key,
but I've got a plan.

271
00:18:22,366 --> 00:18:25,676
 Me and Frenchy and this citizen.
 Yeah, he's a piece of work.

272
00:18:25,766 --> 00:18:29,475
If I'm right, there could be
$500,000 coming in, all cash.

273
00:18:30,446 --> 00:18:34,155
The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday night.

274
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,237
There's a Jewish holiday on Monday.

275
00:18:36,326 --> 00:18:38,635
They won't find out until Tuesday.
Beautiful.

276
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:40,557
What about the security?

277
00:18:40,646 --> 00:18:41,840
Security?

278
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:45,158
You're looking at it. It's a joke.
I'm the midnight to eight man.

279
00:18:45,246 --> 00:18:46,725
I'm the commandant.

280
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:49,604
He just comes in
like he's picking up lost baggage.

281
00:18:49,686 --> 00:18:52,154
 It's beautiful.
 It won't be a problem at all.

282
00:18:52,246 --> 00:18:53,679
 Good.
 We're on.

283
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:58,276
What's really funny is
that fucking bank job in Secaucus.

284
00:18:58,366 --> 00:19:00,322
I'm in the middle of the weeds,
lying down.

285
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:02,761
He says, "What are you doing?"
I said, "I'm resting."

286
00:19:02,846 --> 00:19:06,077
"Here? This ain't no beach or park."
I said, "I'm resting."

287
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,599
I know I'm resting.

288
00:19:07,686 --> 00:19:10,917
He pulls me in, starts asking questions.
You know, this and that.

289
00:19:11,006 --> 00:19:13,918
"What are you going to tell us?"
I said, "My usual. Nothing.

290
00:19:14,006 --> 00:19:18,204
"Why tell you?" The fuck. He says,
"No, you'll tell me something today."

291
00:19:18,486 --> 00:19:20,716
I said, "Okay, go fuck your mother."

292
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:28,002
You saw the paper, Anthony.
My head was out like this.

293
00:19:28,806 --> 00:19:32,082
Now I'm coming around,
and who do I see in front of me?

294
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,761
This prick again. He says,
"What do you want to tell me now?"

295
00:19:35,846 --> 00:19:39,680
I said, "What are you doing here?
I told you to go fuck your mother."

296
00:19:40,606 --> 00:19:42,676
I thought he was gonna shit.

297
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:47,605
The fuckers. I wish I was big just once.

298
00:19:51,686 --> 00:19:53,677
Funny. You're really funny.

299
00:19:54,846 --> 00:19:56,802
What do you mean, I'm funny?

300
00:19:56,886 --> 00:20:00,037
It's funny, you know. It's a good story.

301
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:01,764
You're a funny guy.

302
00:20:02,726 --> 00:20:04,876
You mean the way I talk? What?

303
00:20:05,686 --> 00:20:08,280
It's just, you know. You're just funny.

304
00:20:09,326 --> 00:20:11,635
You know, the way
you tell the story and everything.

305
00:20:11,726 --> 00:20:14,001
Funny how? What's funny about it?

306
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:17,320
 Tommy, you got it all wrong.
 Anthony.

307
00:20:17,406 --> 00:20:19,966
He's a big boy. He knows what he said.
What did you say?

308
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:21,274
Funny, how?

309
00:20:23,686 --> 00:20:25,802
Just, you know. You're funny.

310
00:20:26,246 --> 00:20:28,043
Let me understand this.

311
00:20:28,286 --> 00:20:30,242
Maybe I'm a little fucked up.

312
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:33,557
But, I'm funny, how? Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?

313
00:20:34,286 --> 00:20:36,800
I make you laugh?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?

314
00:20:36,886 --> 00:20:39,480
What do you mean, funny?
How am I funny?

315
00:20:42,806 --> 00:20:45,001
You know, how you tell a story.

316
00:20:45,246 --> 00:20:48,841
No, I don't know. You said it.
How do I know? You said I'm funny.

317
00:20:49,046 --> 00:20:52,322
How the fuck am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?

318
00:20:52,446 --> 00:20:54,164
Tell me what's funny.

319
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:01,437
Get the fuck out of here, Tommy.

320
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,563
Motherfucker! I almost had him !

321
00:21:05,646 --> 00:21:07,602
You stuttering prick, you!

322
00:21:07,686 --> 00:21:09,563
Frankie, was he shaking?

323
00:21:10,566 --> 00:21:14,241
I wonder about you sometimes, Henry.
You may fold under questioning.

324
00:21:18,686 --> 00:21:19,721
Jesus Christ.

325
00:21:19,806 --> 00:21:23,355
What the fuck is it with you?
I thought I was getting pinched already.

326
00:21:23,446 --> 00:21:26,722
He's hanging on my fucking neck
like a vulture. What do you want?

327
00:21:26,806 --> 00:21:29,923
This guy didn't want to come
and give you the check.

328
00:21:30,446 --> 00:21:32,004
Could you take care of this?

329
00:21:32,086 --> 00:21:34,884
No problem. Tell him to put it
on my tab. Of course.

330
00:21:34,966 --> 00:21:36,843
That's what I want to talk to you about.

331
00:21:36,926 --> 00:21:40,236
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.

332
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:44,116
$7,000, that ain't peanuts.
I don't mean to be out of order

333
00:21:44,206 --> 00:21:46,242
Don't mean to be out of order?

334
00:21:46,326 --> 00:21:48,396
It's good you don't mean
to be out of order.

335
00:21:48,486 --> 00:21:52,035
Embarrassing me in front of my friends,
like I'm a deadbeat.

336
00:21:52,406 --> 00:21:54,078
You know, Sonny, you're a fucking mutt.

337
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,122
You know the money
we spend in this fucking

338
00:21:56,206 --> 00:21:58,481
 Don't be like that.
 What do you mean?

339
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:07,917
Do you believe this prick?
You think this is funny?

340
00:22:10,406 --> 00:22:14,319
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fucking moron!

341
00:22:14,606 --> 00:22:16,961
You don't want to bring the check?

342
00:22:18,526 --> 00:22:20,482
Do you believe this prick?

343
00:22:23,206 --> 00:22:25,879
You're supposed
to be doing this stuff, too.

344
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,604
You're a funny guy.

345
00:22:28,486 --> 00:22:30,522
 That's it, Henry.
 No, go back.

346
00:22:32,286 --> 00:22:36,120
You want to laugh? This prick last week
asked me to christen his kid.

347
00:22:36,726 --> 00:22:38,876
I charged him $7,000.

348
00:22:41,766 --> 00:22:43,757
You really are a funny guy.

349
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,517
I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds
of fucking bad things.

350
00:22:50,726 --> 00:22:52,557
He's treating me like I'm a fucking fag.

351
00:22:52,646 --> 00:22:56,116
I got to go on the lam
in order to get away from this guy.

352
00:22:56,206 --> 00:22:59,164
This ain't right. I can't go here,
I can't go there.

353
00:22:59,246 --> 00:23:02,522
You think you're the only one?
I talk to them, they don't listen.

354
00:23:02,606 --> 00:23:06,440
If you tell him, he'll stop.
I'll wind up being declared an MIA.

355
00:23:06,526 --> 00:23:09,438
They'll find me in the back of a car
somewhere in the weeds.

356
00:23:09,526 --> 00:23:12,086
You've known this Tommy all your life.
Who knows better?

357
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:13,679
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.

358
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:17,315
When I leave my house, before I get
to the car I look over both shoulders.

359
00:23:17,406 --> 00:23:19,761
This is no way to live. I'm no fence jumper.

360
00:23:19,846 --> 00:23:22,201
I'm around you all my life,
tell me what I gotta do.

361
00:23:22,286 --> 00:23:25,039
 Whatever I got to do, I'm gonna do.
 What could I do?

362
00:23:25,126 --> 00:23:29,085
If there was something I could do, I would.
I would like to help you out.

363
00:23:29,406 --> 00:23:31,795
Sonny, tell him what we talked about.

364
00:23:32,126 --> 00:23:34,082
You think it's all right?
Yeah, Go on.

365
00:23:34,606 --> 00:23:36,606
Paulie you know.. look.. I..

366
00:23:36,646 --> 00:23:40,275
Maybe you could come in with me,
take a piece of this joint. It'd be good.

367
00:23:40,366 --> 00:23:43,278
What are you talking about?
You mean the restaurant?

368
00:23:43,366 --> 00:23:46,085
It's a classy place. Look at the layout.

369
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:49,158
You've been in there a million times.
You know how it looks.

370
00:23:49,246 --> 00:23:52,921
Tommy taking over this joint
is like putting a silk hat on a pig.

371
00:23:53,006 --> 00:23:55,964
I don't mean no disrespect,
but that's the way it is.

372
00:23:56,046 --> 00:23:59,322
I know you're his friend.
I'm begging you. What can I say?

373
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:02,839
What am I gonna do?
What do you want from me?

374
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:06,556
I don't know anything
about the restaurant business. Nothing.

375
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:10,116
All I know is to sit down and order a meal,
not how to make a restaurant.

376
00:24:10,206 --> 00:24:12,436
Not for you. It's just a place to hang.

377
00:24:12,526 --> 00:24:16,041
The chef is great. The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.

378
00:24:16,126 --> 00:24:19,163
I'd love to help you, but what do you want
from me? What'll I do?

379
00:24:19,246 --> 00:24:22,443
Tommy's a bad kid, a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do? Shoot him?

380
00:24:22,526 --> 00:24:24,437
That wouldn't be a bad idea.

381
00:24:29,246 --> 00:24:33,444
I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean it.
I just mean that he's scaring me.

382
00:24:33,686 --> 00:24:35,995
I just need help. Help me, please.

383
00:24:36,806 --> 00:24:39,161
You know anything about
this restaurant business?

384
00:24:39,246 --> 00:24:42,044
He knows everything.
He's there 24 hours a day.

385
00:24:42,126 --> 00:24:44,765
Another fucking few minutes,
he could be a stool.

386
00:24:44,846 --> 00:24:46,404
That's how often he's in there.

387
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:50,161
You want me to be your partner?
Is that what you're telling me?

388
00:24:50,246 --> 00:24:53,636
What the fuck you think I'm talking about?
Paulie, please. Come on.

389
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:55,637
It's not even fair.

390
00:24:55,926 --> 00:24:57,405
You don't understand.

391
00:24:57,486 --> 00:25:00,876
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you, all right.

392
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:04,959
God bless you, Paulie. I appreciate it.
You've always been fair with me.

393
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:08,834
 Now the guy's got Paulie as a partner.
Any problems, he goes to Paulie.

394
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:10,996
 Trouble with a bill, he can go to Paulie.

395
00:25:11,086 --> 00:25:13,236
 Trouble with the cops,
deliveries, Tommy...

396
00:25:13,326 --> 00:25:14,554
 he can call Paulie.

397
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:17,479
 Now the guy's gotta come up
with Paulie's money every week...

398
00:25:17,566 --> 00:25:18,681
 no matter what.

399
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:22,725
 "Business is bad? Fuck you, pay me.
Had a fire? Fuck you, pay me.

400
00:25:22,806 --> 00:25:25,559
 "The place got hit by lightning?
Fuck you, pay me. "

401
00:25:25,646 --> 00:25:27,796
Can I get one of those TVs?

402
00:25:27,886 --> 00:25:29,558
 Also, Paulie could do anything.

403
00:25:29,646 --> 00:25:32,638
 Especially run up bills on the joint's credit.
And why not?

404
00:25:32,726 --> 00:25:34,682
 Nobody's gonna pay for it anyway.

405
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,757
 When deliveries are made
at the front door...

406
00:25:36,846 --> 00:25:39,485
 you move the stuff out the back
and sell it at a discount.

407
00:25:39,566 --> 00:25:42,717
 You take a $200 case of booze
and sell it for $100.

408
00:25:42,966 --> 00:25:45,355
 It doesn't matter. It's all profit.

409
00:25:47,126 --> 00:25:49,560
 Then finally, when there's nothing left...

410
00:25:49,646 --> 00:25:50,681
Fucking shame.

411
00:25:50,766 --> 00:25:54,805
 ...when you can't borrow another buck
or buy another case of booze...

412
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,559
 you bust the joint out. You light a match.

413
00:25:57,646 --> 00:25:59,159
Do you need help reaching anything?

414
00:25:59,246 --> 00:26:01,555
You look like
you're decorating a Christmas tree.

415
00:26:01,646 --> 00:26:03,796
You don't know what you're doing.

416
00:26:06,406 --> 00:26:08,362
She's from the Five Towns.

417
00:26:09,046 --> 00:26:10,081
Who?

418
00:26:10,646 --> 00:26:13,843
The Jew broad, Diane,
I was telling you I'm going to shag.

419
00:26:14,326 --> 00:26:16,886
I've been trying to bang her
for a fucking month now.

420
00:26:16,966 --> 00:26:19,161
She won't go out with me alone.

421
00:26:19,726 --> 00:26:21,239
 No.
 No, what?

422
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,436
No, what? Who the fuck
asked you anything?

423
00:26:24,526 --> 00:26:26,482
I didn't ask you.
Hear what I'm going to say.

424
00:26:26,566 --> 00:26:28,079
All right, what?

425
00:26:28,606 --> 00:26:29,721
Okay, what.

426
00:26:29,926 --> 00:26:32,486
She don't want to go out
with Italians alone.

427
00:26:32,566 --> 00:26:34,761
She's prejudiced against Italians.

428
00:26:34,846 --> 00:26:37,235
You fucking believe that?
In this day and age?

429
00:26:37,326 --> 00:26:39,794
What the fuck is this world coming to?

430
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:44,441
I can't believe this. A Jew broad,
prejudiced against Italians.

431
00:26:44,526 --> 00:26:47,677
She won't go out with me alone
unless her girlfriend comes with us.

432
00:26:47,766 --> 00:26:49,802
So you come along,
go out with her girlfriend.

433
00:26:49,886 --> 00:26:51,717
See? I knew it.

434
00:26:51,806 --> 00:26:54,115
You knew what?
What the fuck is wrong with that?

435
00:26:54,206 --> 00:26:56,197
 When is this?
 Tomorrow night.

436
00:26:56,286 --> 00:26:57,844
I can't, I gotta meet Tuddy.

437
00:26:57,926 --> 00:27:00,599
You could meet Tuddy.
You can come early and then still go.

438
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:03,041
 Why do you always do this?
 Don't give me that shit.

439
00:27:03,126 --> 00:27:05,560
What did I ask you for?
I'm asking you for a favor.

440
00:27:05,646 --> 00:27:07,443
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.

441
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:10,404
I'm trying to bang this fucking broad.
Help me out.

442
00:27:12,086 --> 00:27:14,395
I don't understand you. She's beautiful!

443
00:27:14,486 --> 00:27:17,523
Her fucking family lives in the Five Towns.
These Jews got money.

444
00:27:17,606 --> 00:27:21,804
Maybe the family owns the whole block.
You may wind up with a big score.

445
00:27:22,846 --> 00:27:24,882
You with your fucking mouth.

446
00:27:29,086 --> 00:27:33,364
 I had a meeting with Tuddy at 11.:00,
and here I am, a backup guy for Tommy.

447
00:27:33,726 --> 00:27:36,035
How about it?
Did you have enough to eat?

448
00:27:36,126 --> 00:27:38,640
It was delicious. I'm just watching my diet.

449
00:27:38,726 --> 00:27:40,079
Let me watch your figure.

450
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:41,724
 I couldn't wait to get away.

451
00:27:41,806 --> 00:27:44,320
 I was ordering the dessert
when they were eating dinner.

452
00:27:44,406 --> 00:27:46,874
 When they were having coffee,
I was asking for a check.

453
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:48,160
 I had business.

454
00:27:48,246 --> 00:27:50,680
Have some coffee. It'll wake you up.

455
00:27:52,886 --> 00:27:54,842
 Can we have the check?
 What are you doing?

456
00:27:54,926 --> 00:27:57,042
 I got to go.
 We just got here.

457
00:27:57,126 --> 00:27:59,037
I got that thing. I gotta go.

458
00:27:59,246 --> 00:28:01,316
Wait a couple of minutes.
We'll leave together.

459
00:28:01,406 --> 00:28:05,081
This way we don't go out
like a bunch of hobos, one at a time.

460
00:28:05,646 --> 00:28:07,364
 I couldn't stand him.

461
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:09,841
 I thought he was really obnoxious.

462
00:28:09,926 --> 00:28:11,882
 He kept fidgeting around.

463
00:28:12,846 --> 00:28:15,644
You don't mind, do you?
That's very annoying.

464
00:28:18,086 --> 00:28:22,159
Good? You might prefer Manischewitz,
but it'd look funny on my table.

465
00:28:24,966 --> 00:28:26,365
 Ready?
 Henry, lighten up.

466
00:28:26,446 --> 00:28:28,596
We just got here. What are you doing?

467
00:28:29,566 --> 00:28:32,876
 Before it was time to go home,
he was pushing me into the car...

468
00:28:32,966 --> 00:28:36,163
 then pulling me out. It was ridiculous.

469
00:28:36,886 --> 00:28:39,002
 Diane and Tommy made us promise...

470
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:40,997
 to meet them again on Friday night.

471
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,235
 We agreed.

472
00:28:42,326 --> 00:28:45,921
 Of course, when Friday night came around,
Henry stood me up.

473
00:28:46,006 --> 00:28:48,725
I feel terrible. I don't know where he is.

474
00:28:49,286 --> 00:28:52,164
He really liked you, too.
All he did was talk about her.

475
00:28:52,246 --> 00:28:54,680
 We were a trio
instead of a double date that night.

476
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:57,564
He would have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.

477
00:28:57,646 --> 00:29:00,285
 But I made Tommy take me
looking for him.

478
00:29:04,526 --> 00:29:06,198
Tommy, what the fuck?

479
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,039
You got some nerve standing me up.

480
00:29:09,126 --> 00:29:10,525
Nobody does that to me.

481
00:29:10,606 --> 00:29:14,155
Who do you think you are,
Frankie Valli or some kind of big shot?

482
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:18,078
Slow down, I forgot.
I thought it was next week.

483
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:21,317
It was this Friday and you agreed,
so you're a liar!

484
00:29:22,326 --> 00:29:24,203
We can talk about this. Take it easy.

485
00:29:24,286 --> 00:29:25,719
Talk about it?

486
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:28,764
Talk to you after what
you just did to me? Forget it.

487
00:29:29,326 --> 00:29:32,875
I thought you would stand me up.
You looked bored. You didn't say anything.

488
00:29:32,966 --> 00:29:34,399
What do you expect?

489
00:29:36,126 --> 00:29:38,037
Let me make it up to you.

490
00:29:38,286 --> 00:29:39,480
I'll think about it.

491
00:29:39,566 --> 00:29:43,036
 I remember, she was screaming
on the street, and I mean loud.

492
00:29:43,126 --> 00:29:44,400
 But she looked good.

493
00:29:44,486 --> 00:29:47,637
I'll think about it.
But it'll cost you, Hill. A lot.

494
00:29:47,726 --> 00:29:50,320
 She had these great eyes
just like Liz Taylor's.

495
00:29:50,406 --> 00:29:52,397
 At least that's what I thought.

496
00:29:53,726 --> 00:29:54,841
Hello, Henry.

497
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,279
 You're ready?
 Yeah.

498
00:29:56,366 --> 00:29:57,401
Come on.

499
00:29:57,486 --> 00:29:59,158
 No, wait a minute.
 What?

500
00:29:59,406 --> 00:30:02,159
Quick, you have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that

501
00:30:02,246 --> 00:30:03,440
Karen.

502
00:30:03,966 --> 00:30:05,001
Mom.

503
00:30:05,206 --> 00:30:07,959
 I'd like you to meet my friend, Henry Hill.
 How do you do?

504
00:30:08,046 --> 00:30:11,402
 Nice to meet you.
 My daughter says that you're half Jewish.

505
00:30:12,366 --> 00:30:14,163
It's just the good half.

506
00:30:14,966 --> 00:30:16,957
 Thank you, sir.
 Bye, see you later, thanks.

507
00:30:17,046 --> 00:30:19,276
What're you doing?
You're leaving your car?

508
00:30:19,366 --> 00:30:21,038
He watches the car for me.

509
00:30:21,126 --> 00:30:23,845
It's easier than leaving it at a garage
and waiting.

510
00:30:23,926 --> 00:30:26,724
It's a lot quicker that way,
you know what I mean?

511
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:36,755
I like going in this way.
It's better than waiting in line.

512
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:44,482
How are you doing? What's up?
Here you go.

513
00:30:50,526 --> 00:30:52,482
 How are you doing?
 I'm doing all right.

514
00:30:52,566 --> 00:30:53,715
Good.

515
00:30:57,006 --> 00:31:01,397
Every time I come here,
every time, you two. Don't you work?

516
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:52,398
Henry, nice to see you. Hi, how are you?

517
00:31:52,486 --> 00:31:54,522
Anthony, right in the front.

518
00:31:54,606 --> 00:31:56,801
Anything you need, just let me know.

519
00:32:14,406 --> 00:32:16,966
Tony, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

520
00:32:17,046 --> 00:32:19,276
 How are you guys doing?
 How are you?

521
00:32:24,646 --> 00:32:27,160
 You gave them $20 each.
 It's all right.

522
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:29,635
Henry, this is with Mr. Tony, over there.

523
00:32:29,726 --> 00:32:31,045
 Where?
 Over there.

524
00:32:31,126 --> 00:32:33,037
Thanks a lot, Tony.

525
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,476
 What do you do?
 What?

526
00:32:38,566 --> 00:32:41,034
 What do you do?
 I'm in construction.

527
00:32:42,926 --> 00:32:45,235
They don't feel like you're in construction.

528
00:32:45,326 --> 00:32:47,044
I'm a union delegate.

529
00:32:48,406 --> 00:32:49,919
 Now, ladies and gentlemen...

530
00:32:50,006 --> 00:32:54,477
 the Copacabana is proud to present
the king of one liners...

531
00:32:54,566 --> 00:32:56,443
 Henny Youngman.

532
00:33:02,326 --> 00:33:05,955
How are you all? I'm glad to be here.
Take my wife, please.

533
00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:10,241
I take my wife everywhere
but she finds her way home.

534
00:33:12,806 --> 00:33:15,115
 I said, "Where do you wanna go
for our anniversary?"

535
00:33:15,206 --> 00:33:17,162
 She said,
"Somewhere I've never been before. "

536
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:19,441
 I said, "Try the kitchen. "

537
00:33:20,486 --> 00:33:21,635
 Dr. Wellsler is here.

538
00:33:21,726 --> 00:33:24,718
 Gave a guy six months to live.
Couldn't pay his bill.

539
00:33:24,806 --> 00:33:26,797
 Gave him another six months.

540
00:33:28,726 --> 00:33:30,523
 I love this crowd.

541
00:33:44,366 --> 00:33:46,277
 Air France made me.

542
00:33:46,366 --> 00:33:50,041
 We walked out with $420,000
without using a gun.

543
00:33:50,126 --> 00:33:53,562
 And we did the right thing.
We gave Paulie his tribute.

544
00:33:57,926 --> 00:33:59,598
$60,000.

545
00:33:59,686 --> 00:34:01,756
It's going to be a good summer.

546
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:08,275
I'm proud of you.
That is a lot of money for a kid like you.

547
00:34:08,366 --> 00:34:12,245
Anybody asks you where you got it,
you got it in Vegas playing craps, all right?

548
00:34:12,326 --> 00:34:13,645
All right.

549
00:34:15,206 --> 00:34:16,559
Check, sir.

550
00:34:18,606 --> 00:34:21,279
No. You have to sign for it here.

551
00:34:22,926 --> 00:34:24,484
Should I tip him?

552
00:34:32,326 --> 00:34:34,681
 How are you doing?
 Okay. How are you?

553
00:34:35,926 --> 00:34:38,679
Henry, this is Bruce. Bruce, this is Henry.

554
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:41,277
Good to meet you.

555
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:44,122
I'll see you around later.

556
00:34:48,646 --> 00:34:50,523
 Do you know him?
 Yeah.

557
00:34:50,606 --> 00:34:52,358
He lives across the street.

558
00:35:16,686 --> 00:35:21,043
 One night, Bobby Vinton sent us
champagne. There was nothing like it.

559
00:35:21,326 --> 00:35:25,035
 I didn't think there was
anything strange in any of this.

560
00:35:25,126 --> 00:35:27,959
 A 21 year old kid with such connections.

561
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:31,997
 He was an exciting guy.

562
00:35:32,606 --> 00:35:36,440
 He was really nice.
He introduced me to everybody.

563
00:35:37,046 --> 00:35:39,435
 Everybody wanted to be nice to him.

564
00:35:40,086 --> 00:35:42,077
 He knew how to handle it.

565
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,961
 Don't buy wigs that come off
at the wrong time.

566
00:35:52,046 --> 00:35:54,640
 Morrie's wigs don't come off!

567
00:35:54,726 --> 00:35:55,954
 Even underwater.

568
00:35:56,046 --> 00:36:00,278
 And remember, Morrie's wigs
are tested against hurricane winds.

569
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:03,995
 Forget about money. You can afford
a Morrie wig. Priced to fit every budget.

570
00:36:04,086 --> 00:36:05,405
 Call me now!

571
00:36:06,726 --> 00:36:09,559
 Come in for a personalized fitting.

572
00:36:12,806 --> 00:36:15,684
Come on, Morrie. Jimmy's waiting.
You're past due.

573
00:36:15,766 --> 00:36:18,200
You're a good kid.
We've been good to each other.

574
00:36:18,286 --> 00:36:20,720
But there's something
unreasonable going on here.

575
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:23,001
Jimmy's being a ball breaker.

576
00:36:23,086 --> 00:36:25,042
Give him 8 to 5 on Cleveland.

577
00:36:25,126 --> 00:36:28,596
I never had to pay the vigorish
he demands. Am I something special?

578
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,358
What am I, a schmuck on wheels?

579
00:36:30,446 --> 00:36:32,880
You know Jimmy.
You borrowed his money. Pay him.

580
00:36:32,966 --> 00:36:35,116
I didn't agree to three points
above the vig.

581
00:36:35,206 --> 00:36:37,674
What are you going to do?
Fight with Jimmy Conway?

582
00:36:37,766 --> 00:36:40,075
He wants his money.
Give him his money and we'll go.

583
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,201
Fuck him !

584
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:44,562
Fuck him in the ear!
Fuck him in the other ear!

585
00:36:44,646 --> 00:36:46,364
Did I ever bust his balls? Did I?

586
00:36:46,446 --> 00:36:49,085
I could've dropped a dime a million times.

587
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:52,283
You're talking crazy. Stop it now, will you?

588
00:36:52,366 --> 00:36:55,517
You got money
for that fucking commercial.

589
00:36:55,606 --> 00:36:57,961
You don't got my money?

590
00:36:58,046 --> 00:36:59,923
Jimmy, he's gonna pay you.

591
00:37:00,006 --> 00:37:03,396
I'll fucking kill you.
Give me the money, cocksucker.

592
00:37:03,486 --> 00:37:05,078
Pay me my money.

593
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:06,724
He'll pay.

594
00:37:07,366 --> 00:37:10,438
Morrie's. Who's this? He's here.

595
00:37:11,366 --> 00:37:13,402
 Jimmy, I'm sorry.
 You should be sorry.

596
00:37:13,486 --> 00:37:16,637
Don't do it again.
Give me the fucking money!

597
00:37:16,726 --> 00:37:19,638
You hear me? Give me the fucking money.

598
00:37:19,726 --> 00:37:23,275
I'll give you. You've got it, kid.
You've got it, believe me.

599
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,436
Karen, slow down.

600
00:37:26,486 --> 00:37:28,636
Where? Stay there. Don't move.

601
00:37:29,566 --> 00:37:31,796
 What happened?
 It's Karen, Jimmy.

602
00:37:31,886 --> 00:37:34,241
 Money today.
 I'll pay.

603
00:37:43,606 --> 00:37:45,836
What happened?

604
00:37:46,486 --> 00:37:48,204
 Are you all right?
 Yeah.

605
00:37:48,286 --> 00:37:49,719
Who did it?

606
00:37:49,806 --> 00:37:54,038
This guy who lives across the street
from me that I've known all my life.

607
00:37:59,006 --> 00:38:01,804
He started to touch me.
He started to grab me.

608
00:38:02,006 --> 00:38:04,566
I told him to stop. He didn't stop.

609
00:38:04,646 --> 00:38:08,355
I hit him back.
And then he got really angry.

610
00:38:10,486 --> 00:38:12,522
He pushed me out of the car.

611
00:38:19,926 --> 00:38:21,882
You sure you're all right?

612
00:38:24,806 --> 00:38:28,355
Why don't you go inside
and get yourself together. Clean up.

613
00:38:48,406 --> 00:38:50,920
What do you want, fucko?
You want something?

614
00:38:57,286 --> 00:39:01,199
I swear on my fucking mother,
if you touch her again, you're dead.

615
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:04,200
Don't shoot.

616
00:39:22,606 --> 00:39:26,394
 Hide this. Are you all right?
 Yeah.

617
00:39:30,366 --> 00:39:33,164
 I know there are women,
like my best friends...

618
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,840
 who would have gotten out
the minute their boyfriend...

619
00:39:35,926 --> 00:39:38,724
 gave them a gun to hide. But I didn't.

620
00:39:39,606 --> 00:39:42,404
 I've got to admit the truth.
It turned me on.

621
00:39:48,646 --> 00:39:49,840
 Mazel tov!

622
00:40:21,046 --> 00:40:24,834
Why don't you be like your friend Henry?
He's got a nice girl.

623
00:40:25,046 --> 00:40:28,038
He's settling down now. He's married.

624
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:30,435
Pretty soon he'll have a nice family.

625
00:40:30,526 --> 00:40:33,962
And you're still bouncing around
from girl to girl.

626
00:40:41,566 --> 00:40:43,796
 It was like he had two families.

627
00:40:44,006 --> 00:40:48,045
 The first time I was introduced
to all of them at once, it was crazy.

628
00:40:48,286 --> 00:40:51,517
 Paulie and his brothers had lots
of sons and nephews.

629
00:40:51,886 --> 00:40:54,684
 Almost all of them
were named Peter or Paul.

630
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:57,599
 It was unbelievable.

631
00:40:57,686 --> 00:41:00,917
Meet Paulie Jr., my nephew.
And this is Petey.

632
00:41:01,206 --> 00:41:04,164
 There must have been two dozen
Peters and Pauls at the wedding.

633
00:41:04,246 --> 00:41:05,361
This is Marie.

634
00:41:05,446 --> 00:41:08,199
 Plus, they were all married
to girls named Marie.

635
00:41:08,526 --> 00:41:11,245
 She looks Italian.
 She is Italian, you're right.

636
00:41:11,326 --> 00:41:13,965
 And they named all their daughters Marie.

637
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:18,395
And this is Pete. No, I mean Paulie.
I get confused myself.

638
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:22,435
 By the time I finished meeting everybody,
I thought I was drunk.

639
00:41:27,086 --> 00:41:28,838
Paulie, you shouldn't have.

640
00:41:31,766 --> 00:41:33,404
Welcome to the family.

641
00:41:33,806 --> 00:41:34,921
Sunday dinner?

642
00:41:35,006 --> 00:41:37,566
So beautiful. I want to cry.

643
00:41:37,966 --> 00:41:40,844
Here's something to help you get started.

644
00:41:56,926 --> 00:42:00,396
 The bag. The bag.
 What? What bag?

645
00:42:00,486 --> 00:42:03,284
The bag with the envelopes in it,
all the money.

646
00:42:04,246 --> 00:42:07,443
Don't worry about that.
Nobody's going to steal that here.

647
00:42:36,686 --> 00:42:38,119
He didn't call?

648
00:42:38,606 --> 00:42:42,121
 He's with his friends.
 What kind of person doesn't call?

649
00:42:42,206 --> 00:42:45,323
He's a grown up. He doesn't have to call
every five minutes.

650
00:42:45,406 --> 00:42:48,842
If he was such a grown up
why doesn't he get you two an apartment?

651
00:42:48,926 --> 00:42:52,202
Don't start. Mom, you're the one
who wanted us here.

652
00:42:52,326 --> 00:42:55,796
You're here a month and sometimes
I know he doesn't come home at all.

653
00:42:55,886 --> 00:42:57,717
What kind of people are these?

654
00:42:57,806 --> 00:43:00,604
 What do you want me to do?
 Do? What can you do?

655
00:43:00,686 --> 00:43:03,439
He's not Jewish.
Did you know how these people live?

656
00:43:03,526 --> 00:43:05,164
Did you know what they were like?

657
00:43:05,246 --> 00:43:08,204
Your father never stayed out all night
without calling.

658
00:43:08,286 --> 00:43:11,676
Stay out? Daddy never
went out at all, Ma ! Keep out of it.

659
00:43:11,766 --> 00:43:13,597
You don't know how I feel!

660
00:43:13,686 --> 00:43:17,474
How do you feel now? You don't know
where he is or who he's with.

661
00:43:17,566 --> 00:43:20,034
He's with his friends! Dad!

662
00:43:20,126 --> 00:43:22,082
Leave him out of this.
He's suffered enough.

663
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,999
He hasn't digested a decent meal
in six weeks.

664
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:37,396
Where were you? Why didn't you call?

665
00:43:37,486 --> 00:43:41,957
We were worried to death.
A married man does not stay out like this.

666
00:43:43,886 --> 00:43:46,446
Normal people don't act like this!

667
00:43:47,846 --> 00:43:49,518
What's wrong with you?

668
00:43:49,966 --> 00:43:53,675
You're not normal. She's right.
What's wrong with you?

669
00:43:53,766 --> 00:43:56,917
What kind of person are you?
What is the matter with you?

670
00:43:57,406 --> 00:43:59,522
What kind of people are they?

671
00:44:02,126 --> 00:44:04,720
 We weren't married to nine to five guys.

672
00:44:04,806 --> 00:44:07,559
 But the first time I realized how different...

673
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:09,921
 was when Mickey had a hostess party.

674
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,166
 Karen, where you from?
 Lawrence.

675
00:44:13,246 --> 00:44:17,364
On the Island. It's nice.
I'm from Miami. You ever been there?

676
00:44:17,806 --> 00:44:21,082
It's okay, but it's like you died
and woke up in Jew heaven.

677
00:44:21,606 --> 00:44:23,881
Angie, stop picking at that thing.

678
00:44:24,006 --> 00:44:25,325
I'd like to smack his face.

679
00:44:25,406 --> 00:44:27,158
The red haired guy, looks like a farmer?

680
00:44:27,246 --> 00:44:29,202
The guy's hands are all over me.

681
00:44:29,286 --> 00:44:33,484
So I told him, "Keep your fucking hands
off me, or I'll cut them off."

682
00:44:35,046 --> 00:44:36,445
She means it.

683
00:44:36,526 --> 00:44:40,041
You don't know how lucky he is.
I just mention this to Vinnie....

684
00:44:40,206 --> 00:44:43,278
How can you mention it?
Vinnie would kill him.

685
00:44:43,366 --> 00:44:47,154
If I don't, he'll kill the miserable bastard,
then Vinnie will be there for life.

686
00:44:47,246 --> 00:44:49,840
You think you got problems.
What about Jeannie's kid?

687
00:44:49,926 --> 00:44:53,601
He was in an argument. A $10 card game.
He pulls out a gun.

688
00:44:53,686 --> 00:44:57,235
The gun goes off. Some kid gets killed.
When the grandmother hears it...

689
00:44:57,326 --> 00:45:01,319
and finds out he's jailed, she has a heart
attack and drops dead right on the spot.

690
00:45:01,406 --> 00:45:05,638
Now Jeannie has a husband and son
in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.

691
00:45:06,446 --> 00:45:09,165
 Jeannie drinks.
 Maybe she's depressed.

692
00:45:09,246 --> 00:45:11,362
Give me a break. She's drunk.

693
00:45:12,766 --> 00:45:16,042
As soon as something happens,
you make them out to be saints.

694
00:45:16,126 --> 00:45:20,836
 They had bad skin and wore too much
makeup. They didn't look very good.

695
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:23,760
 They looked beat up.
And the stuff they wore...

696
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,723
 was thrown together and cheap.

697
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:28,366
 A lot of pantsuits and double knits.

698
00:45:30,206 --> 00:45:31,924
She spends her life in a nightgown.

699
00:45:32,006 --> 00:45:34,281
The woman is no angel, believe me.

700
00:45:34,366 --> 00:45:36,834
 They talked about their rotten kids...

701
00:45:36,926 --> 00:45:39,486
 and about beating them
with broom handles and belts.

702
00:45:39,566 --> 00:45:42,444
 And that the kids
still didn't pay any attention.

703
00:45:42,526 --> 00:45:44,437
 When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy.

704
00:45:44,526 --> 00:45:47,086
I don't know if I could live like that.

705
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:51,602
God forbid, what would happen
if you had to go to prison?

706
00:45:51,806 --> 00:45:53,080
Karen.

707
00:45:53,726 --> 00:45:55,717
Mickey said that Jeannie's husband

708
00:45:55,806 --> 00:45:58,036
Do you know why Jeannie's husband
went to the can?

709
00:45:58,126 --> 00:46:01,436
Because of Jeannie.
He wanted to get away from her.

710
00:46:01,526 --> 00:46:06,077
Let me tell you something.
Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.

711
00:46:06,406 --> 00:46:08,317
Unless they make themselves get caught.

712
00:46:08,406 --> 00:46:10,158
They don't have things organized.

713
00:46:10,246 --> 00:46:13,477
I know what I'm doing.
I've got things organized with these guys.

714
00:46:13,566 --> 00:46:17,844
You know who goes to jail? Nigger
stickup men. Know why they get caught?

715
00:46:17,926 --> 00:46:20,804
Because they fall asleep
in the getaway car, Karen.

716
00:46:21,126 --> 00:46:24,596
Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie.
Come here.

717
00:46:30,926 --> 00:46:33,520
 After a while, it got to be all normal.

718
00:46:34,286 --> 00:46:36,641
 None of it seemed like crime.

719
00:46:36,726 --> 00:46:39,001
 It was more like Henry was enterprising...

720
00:46:39,086 --> 00:46:42,715
 and that he and the guys made bucks
hustling while other guys...

721
00:46:42,806 --> 00:46:45,684
 were sitting on their asses
waiting for handouts.

722
00:46:46,446 --> 00:46:50,325
 Our husbands weren't brain surgeons,
they were blue collar guys.

723
00:46:50,406 --> 00:46:54,797
 The only way they could make real extra
money was to go out and cut corners.

724
00:46:55,206 --> 00:46:57,720
Where's the strong box, you varmint?

725
00:47:03,846 --> 00:47:06,121
Don't fucking move! Don't move.

726
00:47:15,086 --> 00:47:17,805
 See you at the diner.
 I'm riding shotgun.

727
00:47:17,886 --> 00:47:20,525
Did you see him give it right over?

728
00:47:20,606 --> 00:47:23,200
Back to the hideout to split up the loot.

729
00:47:26,966 --> 00:47:29,241
 We were all so very close.

730
00:47:29,326 --> 00:47:33,035
 There were never any outsiders around.
Absolutely never.

731
00:47:33,206 --> 00:47:37,757
 Being together all the time made
everything seem all the more normal.

732
00:47:37,846 --> 00:47:39,199
Hello, Mrs. Hill. Police.

733
00:47:39,286 --> 00:47:43,484
I'm Detective Deacy. This is Detective
Silvestri. We have a search warrant.

734
00:47:43,566 --> 00:47:45,557
Would you read and sign it?

735
00:47:45,766 --> 00:47:47,199
 Anywhere?
 Yeah, anywhere.

736
00:47:47,286 --> 00:47:49,800
This'll take a while,
we have to go through everything.

737
00:47:49,886 --> 00:47:52,844
 You boys want some coffee?
 No coffee now, thanks.

738
00:47:53,846 --> 00:47:56,918
 Be careful.
 We'll just go about our business.

739
00:47:57,006 --> 00:47:59,361
 There was always a little harassment.

740
00:47:59,446 --> 00:48:02,199
 They wanted to talk to Henry
about this or that.

741
00:48:02,286 --> 00:48:05,483
 They'd make me sign
their subpoenas or warrants.

742
00:48:05,566 --> 00:48:07,875
 But mostly they just wanted a handout.

743
00:48:07,966 --> 00:48:11,242
 A few bucks to keep things quiet
no matter what they found.

744
00:48:16,286 --> 00:48:20,996
 I always asked if they wanted coffee.
Some wives, like Mickey Conway...

745
00:48:21,206 --> 00:48:24,004
 used to curse at them
and spit on the floor.

746
00:48:24,086 --> 00:48:27,601
 She used to spit on her own floor.
That never made any sense to me.

747
00:48:27,686 --> 00:48:30,598
 It was better to be polite
and call the lawyer.

748
00:48:39,366 --> 00:48:43,723
 We always did everything together,
and we always were in the same crowd.

749
00:48:43,806 --> 00:48:47,640
 Anniversaries, christenings.
We only went to each other's houses.

750
00:48:49,686 --> 00:48:51,039
 The women played cards.

751
00:48:51,126 --> 00:48:55,085
 When kids were born, Mickey and Jimmy
were the first at the hospital.

752
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:58,203
 When we went to the Islands
or Vegas for vacation...

753
00:48:58,286 --> 00:48:59,560
 we went together.

754
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:02,604
 No outsiders ever. It got to be normal.

755
00:49:02,726 --> 00:49:05,718
 It got to where I was proud
that I had the kind of husband...

756
00:49:05,806 --> 00:49:09,401
 who was willing to risk his neck
just to get us the little extras.

757
00:49:10,246 --> 00:49:13,397
But I got Mom to watch the babies
tomorrow night.

758
00:49:13,486 --> 00:49:15,317
 Can't do it, Karen.
 Why not?

759
00:49:15,406 --> 00:49:17,966
I just can't. I got something lined up.

760
00:49:18,406 --> 00:49:21,523
But tomorrow's the only night
she can do it.

761
00:49:21,606 --> 00:49:25,042
 Pretty please?
 I can't. What do you want me to do?

762
00:49:26,406 --> 00:49:28,476
 I got to go.
 Wait a minute.

763
00:49:29,606 --> 00:49:31,836
I wanted to go shopping.
Can I get some money?

764
00:49:31,926 --> 00:49:33,598
How much do you need?

765
00:49:35,366 --> 00:49:37,118
 How much?
 That much.

766
00:49:41,766 --> 00:49:44,485
This much. Give me a kiss.

767
00:49:47,926 --> 00:49:49,484
See you later.

768
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,481
All right.

769
00:50:26,406 --> 00:50:28,203
Welcome home, Batts.

770
00:50:29,766 --> 00:50:31,563
Hi, how are you?

771
00:50:32,046 --> 00:50:35,197
Sit down. Have a drink.
Give them all a drink.

772
00:50:35,846 --> 00:50:38,280
And give those Irish hoodlums a drink.

773
00:50:38,366 --> 00:50:40,163
There's only one Irishman here.

774
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:42,237
It's a celebration, fellas.

775
00:50:42,326 --> 00:50:45,318
 Top of the morning to you.
 It's good to be home.

776
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:51,038
This is my friend Jimmy.

777
00:50:51,126 --> 00:50:53,686
Henry. It's his joint. This is Lisa.

778
00:50:55,006 --> 00:50:56,644
Tommy. All dressed up.

779
00:50:56,726 --> 00:50:59,638
All grown up and doing the town.
Look at this.

780
00:50:59,726 --> 00:51:02,399
Forgot you were having a party
for this mug.

781
00:51:03,086 --> 00:51:04,644
Come here.

782
00:51:04,726 --> 00:51:07,001
I'll say hello. Billy, how are you?

783
00:51:07,086 --> 00:51:09,839
Get over here.
I haven't seen you in six years.

784
00:51:09,926 --> 00:51:12,918
Jesus Christ Almighty. You look terrific.

785
00:51:13,566 --> 00:51:14,885
Watch the suit.

786
00:51:15,366 --> 00:51:18,403
You little prick. I've known you all my life.

787
00:51:18,886 --> 00:51:22,640
 Don't get too big on me.
 Just don't bust my balls.

788
00:51:22,726 --> 00:51:26,605
If I was gonna break your balls,
I'd say, "Go get your shine box."

789
00:51:28,246 --> 00:51:30,441
This kid was great.

790
00:51:30,526 --> 00:51:32,642
They used to call him "Spitshine Tommy."

791
00:51:32,726 --> 00:51:36,685
He'd make your shoes look like
fucking mirrors. Excuse my language.

792
00:51:36,766 --> 00:51:40,600
He was terrific. He was the best.
He made a lot of money, too.

793
00:51:41,886 --> 00:51:43,444
No more shines, Billy.

794
00:51:44,006 --> 00:51:45,439
 What?
 I said no more shines.

795
00:51:45,526 --> 00:51:48,279
You've been away a long time.
They didn't tell you.

796
00:51:48,366 --> 00:51:50,402
I don't shine shoes anymore.

797
00:51:50,806 --> 00:51:54,719
Relax. What's got into you?
I'm breaking your balls a little, that's all.

798
00:51:54,806 --> 00:51:56,159
I'm only kidding with you.

799
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:59,522
Sometimes you don't sound like it.
There's a lot of people around.

800
00:51:59,606 --> 00:52:01,722
I'm only kidding. We're having a party.

801
00:52:01,806 --> 00:52:05,435
I haven't seen you in a long time
and you get fucking fresh.

802
00:52:05,526 --> 00:52:07,482
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

803
00:52:07,566 --> 00:52:09,841
I'm sorry, too. It's okay. No problem.

804
00:52:14,246 --> 00:52:16,316
Now go home and get your fucking
shine box.

805
00:52:16,406 --> 00:52:17,964
Motherfucking mutt!

806
00:52:18,046 --> 00:52:20,355
You fucking piece of shit!

807
00:52:20,966 --> 00:52:22,718
Come on, come on!

808
00:52:23,806 --> 00:52:26,525
He bought his fucking button!
That fake old tough guy!

809
00:52:26,606 --> 00:52:28,881
You bought your fucking button!

810
00:52:28,966 --> 00:52:31,241
 Don't get nervous.
 You motherfucker!

811
00:52:31,326 --> 00:52:33,999
Keep that motherfucker here!
Keep him here.

812
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:37,602
Come on, you fucking feel strong?

813
00:52:37,686 --> 00:52:40,758
Sorry. Tommy gets a little loaded.
He doesn't mean any disrespect.

814
00:52:40,846 --> 00:52:43,280
He doesn't mean any disrespect?
Are you nuts?

815
00:52:43,366 --> 00:52:46,756
Teach this kid a little fucking manners.
What's right is right.

816
00:52:46,846 --> 00:52:49,280
 You understand what I'm saying?
 It's all right.

817
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:53,598
We're hugging and kissing over here
and then he acts like a fucking jerk.

818
00:52:55,446 --> 00:52:58,244
You insulted him a little bit.
You got a little out of order.

819
00:52:58,326 --> 00:53:00,601
 I didn't.
 You insulted him a little.

820
00:53:00,686 --> 00:53:03,837
 I didn't insult anybody. Give us a drink.
 Okay.

821
00:53:04,246 --> 00:53:06,441
Let's have some drinks.
Drinks on the house.

822
00:53:06,526 --> 00:53:08,517
No, have the drink with me.

823
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,563
The drinks are on the house.

824
00:53:13,246 --> 00:53:16,158
I fucked kids like that in the can.
In the ass.

825
00:53:16,486 --> 00:53:18,397
Fucking break up my party.

826
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:28,084
You've been away for six years.
It's different now.

827
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:30,396
I did my fucking time, Jimmy.

828
00:53:31,206 --> 00:53:35,279
I came home and I want what I got to get.
I got mouths to feed.

829
00:53:35,366 --> 00:53:37,926
 You're gonna get it.
 You understand?

830
00:53:40,566 --> 00:53:42,238
Get the door!

831
00:53:56,486 --> 00:53:58,841
Let me shoot him
in his big, fucking mouth!

832
00:53:58,926 --> 00:54:00,439
Let's shoot him.

833
00:54:17,606 --> 00:54:19,562
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.

834
00:54:19,646 --> 00:54:22,240
His whole crew is going to be
looking for him.

835
00:54:24,086 --> 00:54:28,682
This is bad. What do we do with him?
We can't just dump him on the street.

836
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:32,315
I know a place upstate.
They'll never find him. More tablecloths.

837
00:54:32,406 --> 00:54:34,920
I didn't want to get blood on your floor.

838
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,238
Go open your trunk.

839
00:54:44,366 --> 00:54:46,038
We'll get a shovel at my mother's house.

840
00:54:55,046 --> 00:54:58,880
She has a shovel here somewhere.
Quiet, I don't want to wake her up.

841
00:55:00,606 --> 00:55:03,074
Look who's here.

842
00:55:04,286 --> 00:55:06,197
What did you do? What happened?

843
00:55:06,286 --> 00:55:08,800
I hit something on the road.
Jimmy will tell you.

844
00:55:08,886 --> 00:55:11,002
What happened to him?

845
00:55:12,006 --> 00:55:15,760
I haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?

846
00:55:15,846 --> 00:55:17,723
You, too. How are you?

847
00:55:17,806 --> 00:55:19,034
Why are you up so late?

848
00:55:19,126 --> 00:55:23,358
He came in. You came in.
I'm so happy to see him.

849
00:55:23,446 --> 00:55:27,200
Go inside. Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll make you something to eat.

850
00:55:27,286 --> 00:55:30,005
 Go to sleep. We're leaving.
 I can't. Not while he's home.

851
00:55:30,086 --> 00:55:32,361
I haven't seen him in so long.
I want to see him.

852
00:55:32,446 --> 00:55:33,720
You go inside.

853
00:55:33,806 --> 00:55:35,125
This stuff is like lead.

854
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:38,243
Tell me, where you been?
I haven't seen you.

855
00:55:38,326 --> 00:55:40,999
You haven't called. Where have you been?

856
00:55:41,086 --> 00:55:43,964
 I been working nights.
 And?

857
00:55:44,046 --> 00:55:45,843
And tonight we were out late.

858
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:49,282
We took a ride out to the country
and hit a deer.

859
00:55:49,366 --> 00:55:52,278
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.

860
00:55:52,886 --> 00:55:56,003
It reminds me, I need this knife.
I'm taking this, okay?

861
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:57,917
 Okay.
 Just for a while.

862
00:55:58,006 --> 00:55:59,439
The poor thing.

863
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:03,201
We hit the deer and his paw....
What do you call it?

864
00:56:03,286 --> 00:56:04,924
The paw.

865
00:56:05,006 --> 00:56:07,395
 The hoof.
 Got caught in the grill.

866
00:56:07,486 --> 00:56:09,317
I got to hack it off.

867
00:56:09,406 --> 00:56:11,681
Ma, it's a sin to leave it there.

868
00:56:11,766 --> 00:56:13,563
I'll bring the knife back.

869
00:56:14,006 --> 00:56:15,803
 Delicious.
 Thank you.

870
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:18,156
Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?

871
00:56:18,246 --> 00:56:20,077
I do, almost every night.

872
00:56:20,166 --> 00:56:22,680
But get yourself a girl
so you could settle down.

873
00:56:22,766 --> 00:56:27,521
I do, every night. Then I'm free.
I love you, I want to be with you.

874
00:56:27,606 --> 00:56:28,959
Settle down.

875
00:56:30,766 --> 00:56:32,404
How's your friend Henry?

876
00:56:32,486 --> 00:56:34,841
What's the matter? You don't talk much.

877
00:56:34,926 --> 00:56:36,678
Talk. What are you quiet for?

878
00:56:36,766 --> 00:56:39,200
You don't eat much, you don't talk much.

879
00:56:39,286 --> 00:56:41,720
 I'm just listening.
 Something wrong?

880
00:56:41,806 --> 00:56:45,242
 When we were kids,
the compares used to visit each other.

881
00:56:45,446 --> 00:56:49,997
There was this man. He would never talk.
He'd just sit there all night, not a word.

882
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:54,524
They say to him, "What's the matter?
Don't you say anything?"

883
00:56:55,086 --> 00:56:58,635
He says, "What am I going to say,
that my wife two times me?"

884
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:02,363
So she says, "Shut up!
You're always talking."

885
00:57:04,166 --> 00:57:06,634
But in Italian, it sounds much nicer.

886
00:57:06,726 --> 00:57:08,284
  Cornuto contento.
 That's it.

887
00:57:08,366 --> 00:57:11,836
 What does that mean?
 It means he's content to be a jerk.

888
00:57:12,406 --> 00:57:14,840
He doesn't care who knows it.

889
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:17,680
 Did Tommy tell you about my painting?
 No.

890
00:57:18,646 --> 00:57:20,079
Look at this.

891
00:57:20,366 --> 00:57:21,594
It's beautiful.

892
00:57:21,686 --> 00:57:24,678
I like it. One dog goes one way
and the other goes the other.

893
00:57:24,766 --> 00:57:27,155
One's facing east, the other west.
So what?

894
00:57:27,246 --> 00:57:30,602
He's saying, "What do you want from me?"
The guy's got nice white hair.

895
00:57:30,686 --> 00:57:32,836
Beautiful. The dog looks the same.

896
00:57:32,926 --> 00:57:34,837
Looks like somebody we know.

897
00:57:36,526 --> 00:57:38,562
Without the beard. It's him.

898
00:57:41,046 --> 00:57:42,240
It's him.

899
00:57:51,366 --> 00:57:52,719
What the fuck is that?

900
00:57:52,806 --> 00:57:55,366
 For most of the guys,
killings were accepted.

901
00:57:55,446 --> 00:57:58,119
 Murder was the only way
everybody stayed in line.

902
00:57:58,206 --> 00:58:01,403
 You got out of line, you got whacked.
Everybody knew the rules.

903
00:58:01,486 --> 00:58:04,876
 Sometimes, even if people didn't
get out of line, they got whacked.

904
00:58:04,966 --> 00:58:09,278
 Hits became a habit. Guys would get
into arguments over nothing.

905
00:58:09,366 --> 00:58:11,561
 Before you knew it, one was dead.

906
00:58:11,646 --> 00:58:13,841
 They were shooting each other
all the time.

907
00:58:13,926 --> 00:58:17,362
 Shooting people was a normal thing.
It was no big deal.

908
00:58:18,846 --> 00:58:21,679
 We had a serious problem with Billy Batts.

909
00:58:21,766 --> 00:58:25,759
 This was really a touchy thing.
Tommy killed a made guy.

910
00:58:25,846 --> 00:58:29,441
 Batts was part of the Gambino crew
and was considered untouchable.

911
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:33,396
 Before you touched a made guy,
you had to have a good reason.

912
00:58:33,486 --> 00:58:36,205
 You had to have a sit down
and you'd better get an okay...

913
00:58:36,286 --> 00:58:38,516
 or you'd be the one who got whacked.

914
00:58:50,246 --> 00:58:52,077
 Saturday night was for wives...

915
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:55,203
 but Friday night at the Copa
was for the girlfriends.

916
00:58:56,926 --> 00:58:59,156
Last week, we saw Sammy Davis, Jr.

917
00:58:59,246 --> 00:59:02,124
You got to see this show.
What a performer.

918
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:05,642
He does these impersonations.
You'd think it was the real people.

919
00:59:05,726 --> 00:59:09,685
It's unbelievable. You could see
how a white girl could fall for him.

920
00:59:10,006 --> 00:59:11,041
What?

921
00:59:11,646 --> 00:59:15,958
Not me. But you could see how
some girls could. Like that Swedish girl.

922
00:59:16,366 --> 00:59:18,243
So you condone that stuff.

923
00:59:18,326 --> 00:59:19,645
Take it easy.

924
00:59:21,246 --> 00:59:24,079
I don't want to be kissing
Nat King Cole over here.

925
00:59:24,166 --> 00:59:26,043
No, I'm not talking about me.

926
00:59:27,366 --> 00:59:29,243
But, you know, he's got personality.

927
00:59:29,326 --> 00:59:30,759
Personality?

928
00:59:32,126 --> 00:59:35,084
He's talented.
I understand what you're saying.

929
00:59:35,166 --> 00:59:38,476
But watch what you say.
People get the wrong impression.

930
00:59:38,566 --> 00:59:40,921
I just said he was talented,
you're unbelievable.

931
00:59:41,006 --> 00:59:43,474
Just leave it alone now,
I understand what you said.

932
00:59:43,566 --> 00:59:45,557
He's talented. Leave it at that.

933
01:01:20,126 --> 01:01:22,276
No? Not even Uncle Paulie?

934
01:01:38,206 --> 01:01:40,436
What did you hear about that thing?

935
01:01:41,086 --> 01:01:43,964
 The Brooklyn thing?
 No, the guy from downtown.

936
01:01:44,606 --> 01:01:47,643
 The guy from where Christie lived?
 No.

937
01:01:48,766 --> 01:01:51,838
The guy who disappeared,
the one they made the beef on.

938
01:01:52,566 --> 01:01:54,477
 Know the guy I mean?
 Yeah.

939
01:01:54,566 --> 01:01:58,525
His name was Batts. His people
are driving everyone crazy looking for him.

940
01:01:58,606 --> 01:02:00,324
Nobody knows what happened to him.

941
01:02:00,406 --> 01:02:04,319
He came into the joint that night
and then just disappeared. That was it.

942
01:02:06,086 --> 01:02:10,045
All right. Keep your eyes open.
They're busting my balls over it.

943
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:12,437
 All right?
 Yeah.

944
01:02:14,846 --> 01:02:16,882
Okay, everybody, let's eat.

945
01:02:22,846 --> 01:02:24,404
I want my money.

946
01:02:25,446 --> 01:02:26,765
He owes it.

947
01:02:35,286 --> 01:02:38,039
You know that thing
we took care of upstate?

948
01:02:38,126 --> 01:02:41,436
 Paulie was talking about that.
 Got to get it out of there.

949
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:44,526
They just sold the property
to make condominiums.

950
01:02:44,606 --> 01:02:48,121
 It's been six months.
 We got to get it out of there right away.

951
01:03:00,086 --> 01:03:04,284
Henry, hurry up. My mother's making
fried peppers and sausage for us.

952
01:03:07,726 --> 01:03:09,921
 Here's an arm.
 Very funny, guys.

953
01:03:10,006 --> 01:03:11,439
Here's a leg.

954
01:03:11,526 --> 01:03:12,925
Here's a wing.

955
01:03:13,646 --> 01:03:17,958
What do you like, the leg or the wing?
Or you still go for the hearts and lungs?

956
01:03:19,126 --> 01:03:20,764
Oh, that's so bad.

957
01:03:27,326 --> 01:03:29,078
What happened to the car?

958
01:03:29,566 --> 01:03:31,204
I hit a skunk, all right?

959
01:03:31,286 --> 01:03:32,958
Go with your mother.

960
01:03:33,966 --> 01:03:35,718
It's disgusting, Henry.

961
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:42,444
 I set up Janice in an apartment
around the corner from The Suite.

962
01:03:42,526 --> 01:03:45,245
 That way I was able to stay over
a couple of nights a week.

963
01:03:45,326 --> 01:03:46,554
This is my new antique lamp.

964
01:03:46,646 --> 01:03:49,683
 Karen was home with the kids.
She never asked questions.

965
01:03:49,766 --> 01:03:51,597
The furniture's all Maurice Valencia.

966
01:03:51,686 --> 01:03:53,278
Looks like Roma.

967
01:03:53,366 --> 01:03:55,561
This is all silk. This is from Siam.

968
01:03:57,486 --> 01:03:59,158
Come see my bedroom.

969
01:03:59,886 --> 01:04:03,561
 Tommy, will you take him?
 I'll eat this fucking dog tonight.

970
01:04:07,366 --> 01:04:09,402
Love that crystal ball or what?

971
01:04:10,886 --> 01:04:13,719
This is where we spend most of our time.

972
01:04:15,446 --> 01:04:17,641
I love the floral arrangements.

973
01:04:19,566 --> 01:04:20,601
French.

974
01:04:20,686 --> 01:04:24,520
 Janice and I were having so much fun,
she started screwing up at work.

975
01:04:24,606 --> 01:04:27,040
 I had to straighten out her boss a little bit.

976
01:04:27,126 --> 01:04:30,641
Janice can do what she wants to do.
Got it?

977
01:04:30,726 --> 01:04:34,924
Just try to run. Hang up once more,
and you'll deal with me.

978
01:04:40,286 --> 01:04:42,402
Come on, get off of her.

979
01:04:42,726 --> 01:04:44,364
You're an animal.

980
01:04:56,766 --> 01:05:00,395
Spider, on your way over here,
bring me a Cutty and water.

981
01:05:02,726 --> 01:05:04,956
 Did you guys eat?
 I'm starving.

982
01:05:06,366 --> 01:05:08,596
 I'll play these.
 You'll play those?

983
01:05:08,686 --> 01:05:10,677
Do I stutter? I play those.

984
01:05:14,366 --> 01:05:16,243
What am I? A mirage?

985
01:05:16,486 --> 01:05:19,080
Where's my fucking drink?
I asked you for a drink.

986
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:21,805
 You wanted a drink?
 I asked you for one.

987
01:05:21,886 --> 01:05:24,684
I thought you said, "I'm all right, Spider."

988
01:05:25,446 --> 01:05:27,357
Am I on a pay no mind list?

989
01:05:27,446 --> 01:05:31,564
No, I heard someone say "Spider, Spider."

990
01:05:31,646 --> 01:05:34,877
 I thought it was Henry.
 You're a mumbling, stuttering little fuck.

991
01:05:34,966 --> 01:05:37,036
I thought you said, "I'm all right, Spider."

992
01:05:37,126 --> 01:05:38,798
You ain't all right.

993
01:05:38,886 --> 01:05:41,036
No, I thought you said you were all right.

994
01:05:41,126 --> 01:05:43,924
I am all right! You ain't, you prick.

995
01:05:45,966 --> 01:05:49,003
You've been doing this all fucking night
to me, you motherfucker!

996
01:05:49,086 --> 01:05:51,236
He wants a drink now? I'll bring it.

997
01:05:51,326 --> 01:05:53,920
Go get me a fucking drink!
Move it, you little prick.

998
01:05:54,006 --> 01:05:56,474
You walk like fucking Stepin Fetchit.

999
01:05:56,726 --> 01:05:58,478
For everybody else you run.

1000
01:05:58,566 --> 01:06:02,081
Run for me, you prick!
Dance, dance the fucking drink back here!

1001
01:06:02,326 --> 01:06:04,078
What's that movie that Bogart made?

1002
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:06,760
  Where he played a cowboy.
 The Oklahoma Kid.

1003
01:06:06,846 --> 01:06:10,805
  Shane?
 Oklahoma Kid, that's me!

1004
01:06:10,886 --> 01:06:13,446
You fucking varmint. Dance!

1005
01:06:13,526 --> 01:06:15,437
Yahoo, you motherfucker!

1006
01:06:15,926 --> 01:06:17,996
Round up those fucking wagons.

1007
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:25,404
Now he's moving.

1008
01:06:26,326 --> 01:06:28,886
 Henry, what happened?
 You shot him in the foot, Tommy.

1009
01:06:28,966 --> 01:06:33,118
He's fucking fine. So he got shot
in the foot. What is it? A big fucking deal?

1010
01:06:33,206 --> 01:06:35,640
 Get a towel.
 Nice fucking game.

1011
01:06:37,086 --> 01:06:41,637
Take him to Ben Casey, the little prick.
Let him crawl like he crawls for the drinks.

1012
01:06:42,166 --> 01:06:44,726
Take him to the doctor down the street.

1013
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:46,844
Bones are all shattered.

1014
01:06:46,966 --> 01:06:48,718
Don't get me upset, now.

1015
01:06:48,806 --> 01:06:52,321
Don't make a big fucking thing out of it,
Spider, you little prick.

1016
01:06:52,406 --> 01:06:55,045
You trying to make me think
what the fuck I did here.

1017
01:06:55,126 --> 01:06:56,923
It was an accident.

1018
01:06:57,246 --> 01:06:59,441
 Little fucking actor.
 I got a great hand here.

1019
01:06:59,526 --> 01:07:00,925
 You in or out?
 Yeah, I'm in.

1020
01:07:01,006 --> 01:07:02,837
 $800.
 $800?

1021
01:07:03,566 --> 01:07:07,036
You haven't been home in two weeks.
You're not going out tonight!

1022
01:07:07,526 --> 01:07:10,563
Karen, will you grow up! Stop!
I'm still gonna go out!

1023
01:07:10,646 --> 01:07:12,557
Not without your car keys, you're not.

1024
01:07:12,646 --> 01:07:14,637
Are you nuts? What's your problem?

1025
01:07:14,726 --> 01:07:16,842
Yes, I'm nuts. Something's going on.

1026
01:07:17,046 --> 01:07:19,844
 Stop with that. Enough! Stop with that.
 No!

1027
01:07:19,966 --> 01:07:23,515
I'm telling you, I look in your face
and I know that you're lying!

1028
01:07:25,686 --> 01:07:27,802
 Get out! Get out!
 Shut up.

1029
01:07:27,926 --> 01:07:29,075
Get out of my life!

1030
01:07:29,166 --> 01:07:32,078
You're fucked in the head, Karen.
This is all in your mind.

1031
01:07:32,166 --> 01:07:34,475
 You're a lousy bastard!
 You got a problem.

1032
01:07:34,566 --> 01:07:38,241
Go ahead, go to your ready made whores.
That's all you're good for!

1033
01:07:38,486 --> 01:07:41,796
Get out of my life! I can't stand you!

1034
01:07:52,126 --> 01:07:53,844
Spider, what's your rush?

1035
01:07:56,326 --> 01:07:58,362
 Here you go.
 Thank you, Spider.

1036
01:07:58,446 --> 01:08:02,485
Spider, that fucking bandage on your foot
is bigger than your fucking head.

1037
01:08:04,406 --> 01:08:08,081
Next thing you know, he's gonna be
coming in one of these fucking walkers.

1038
01:08:08,166 --> 01:08:09,963
Even though you got that, you can dance?

1039
01:08:10,046 --> 01:08:14,437
Give us a couple of fucking steps, Spider.
You fucking bullshitter, you.

1040
01:08:14,686 --> 01:08:16,881
Tell the truth.
You're looking for sympathy?

1041
01:08:16,966 --> 01:08:19,241
Why don't you go fuck yourself, Tommy?

1042
01:08:23,606 --> 01:08:26,120
I didn't fucking hear right.
Can't believe what I heard.

1043
01:08:26,206 --> 01:08:28,595
Spider, here. This is for you. Attaboy.

1044
01:08:29,366 --> 01:08:32,278
I got respect for this kid.
He's got a lot of fucking balls.

1045
01:08:32,366 --> 01:08:34,880
Good for you.
Don't take no shit off nobody.

1046
01:08:35,126 --> 01:08:38,596
He shoots him in the foot,
he tells him to go fuck himself.

1047
01:08:40,086 --> 01:08:43,317
Are you gonna let this fucking punk
get away with that?

1048
01:08:43,406 --> 01:08:46,000
What's the matter?
What's the world coming to?

1049
01:08:49,406 --> 01:08:52,398
That's what the fucking world
is coming to. How do you like that?

1050
01:08:52,486 --> 01:08:55,683
 How's that, all right?
 What's the fucking matter with you?

1051
01:08:55,766 --> 01:08:57,677
What are you, stupid or what?

1052
01:08:57,766 --> 01:09:00,803
Tommy, I'm kidding with you.
Are you a fucking sick maniac?

1053
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:03,923
How do I know if you're kidding?
You're breaking my fucking balls?

1054
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:06,566
I'm fucking kidding with you,
you fucking shoot the guy?

1055
01:09:06,646 --> 01:09:07,795
He's dead.

1056
01:09:09,366 --> 01:09:11,675
Good shot. I'm a lucky man. Good shot.

1057
01:09:11,766 --> 01:09:13,119
You can't miss at this distance.

1058
01:09:13,206 --> 01:09:15,083
You got a problem
with what I did, Anthony?

1059
01:09:15,166 --> 01:09:16,235
No.

1060
01:09:16,326 --> 01:09:19,955
Fucking rat. His whole family's all rats.
He would've grown up to be a rat.

1061
01:09:20,046 --> 01:09:22,196
Stupid bastard! I can't fucking believe you.

1062
01:09:22,286 --> 01:09:25,995
Now you're going to dig the hole.
I got no fucking lime.

1063
01:09:26,646 --> 01:09:30,275
I'll dig the hole. I don't give a fuck.
Is it the first hole I dug?

1064
01:09:30,486 --> 01:09:33,080
I'll dig the fucking hole.
Where are the shovels?

1065
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,229
  Hello.
 Hello?

1066
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:37,864
This is Karen Hill. I wanna talk to you.

1067
01:09:38,910 --> 01:09:41,629
Hello? Don't hang up on me!

1068
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:43,507
 I want to talk to you!

1069
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:46,469
 You keep away from my husband,
you hear me?

1070
01:09:47,670 --> 01:09:50,059
 Hello? Open the door!

1071
01:09:51,870 --> 01:09:53,223
Answer me!

1072
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:56,104
I'm gonna tell everyone
who walks in this building...

1073
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:58,863
that in 2R, Rossi,
you are nothing but a whore!

1074
01:09:58,950 --> 01:10:00,588
Is this the superintendent?

1075
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:03,104
Yes, I want you to know, sir,
that you have a whore...

1076
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:04,669
 living in 2R!

1077
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:07,748
Rossi, Janice Rossi. Do you hear me?

1078
01:10:08,190 --> 01:10:09,703
 He's my husband!

1079
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:12,384
 Get your own goddamn man!

1080
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:15,069
Wake up, Henry.

1081
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:29,582
What are you doing?

1082
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:34,903
 Karen, are you crazy?
 I am crazy.

1083
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:38,618
I'm crazy enough to kill both of you.

1084
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:43,102
Karen, take it easy.

1085
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:48,347
 Okay?
 Do you love her?

1086
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:51,019
Do you?

1087
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:53,986
 Do you?
 Karen...

1088
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:58,499
I love you. You know I love you.

1089
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,302
You don't.

1090
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:04,388
No, you don't.

1091
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:07,584
Please, be careful. Baby, don't.

1092
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:11,581
 But still I couldn't hurt him.
How could I hurt him?

1093
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:14,264
 I couldn't even bring myself to leave him.

1094
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:15,863
 The truth was...

1095
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:18,145
 that no matter how bad I felt...

1096
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:21,225
 I was still very attracted to him.

1097
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:24,665
 Why should I give him to someone else?

1098
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:26,547
 Why should she win?

1099
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:31,862
Just put it down.

1100
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:35,345
You know I love you, don't you?

1101
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:37,541
You're all I want, Karen.

1102
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:41,026
Please put the gun down, Karen.

1103
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:44,424
Baby, come on.

1104
01:11:57,790 --> 01:12:00,065
What are you, fucking crazy, Karen?

1105
01:12:01,390 --> 01:12:04,143
I got enough to worry about
getting whacked on the street!

1106
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:07,745
I got to fucking come home for this?

1107
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:10,226
I should fucking kill you!

1108
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:13,182
How does it feel?

1109
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:16,067
How does it feel, Karen?

1110
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:33,861
I'm sorry!

1111
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:42,461
Hi, Jimmy! How are you?

1112
01:12:43,310 --> 01:12:46,268
 Looking good.
 Thank you. Good to see you.

1113
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:48,784
 Hi, Paulie!
 Hi, honey. How are you?

1114
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:49,905
Good.

1115
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:52,584
 Why don't you go get cigarettes, okay?
 Sure.

1116
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:55,824
 Any of you need anything?
 I'm all right.

1117
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:58,908
 Want anything to drink? A beer?
 No.

1118
01:12:58,990 --> 01:13:01,458
 Chinese food?
 No, come on, sit down.

1119
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:09,867
Karen came to the house.

1120
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:11,187
She's very upset.

1121
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:13,979
This is no good.
You gotta straighten this thing out.

1122
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:17,221
We got to have calm now. We don't know
what the hell she's gonna do.

1123
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:19,619
She's getting all hysterical.
She gets very excited.

1124
01:13:19,710 --> 01:13:23,464
She's wild. And you got to take it easy.
You got children.

1125
01:13:24,190 --> 01:13:27,580
I'm not saying you gotta go back to her
this minute, but you gotta go back.

1126
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:30,104
It's the only way.
You gotta keep up appearances.

1127
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:32,624
The two of them come over every day,
commiserating.

1128
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:34,587
I can't have it.

1129
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:38,019
I can't do it, Henry.

1130
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:41,102
Nobody says that you can't do
what you wanna do.

1131
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:43,829
We all know that. I mean, this is what it is.

1132
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:46,629
We know what it is.
You have to do the right thing.

1133
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:49,019
You have to go home to the family,
you understand?

1134
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:51,624
You got to go home, okay? Look at me.

1135
01:13:51,910 --> 01:13:54,060
You gotta go home. Smarten up.

1136
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:56,223
 All right?
 All right.

1137
01:13:56,350 --> 01:13:57,908
I'm gonna talk to Karen.

1138
01:13:57,990 --> 01:14:01,380
I'll straighten this out.
I know just what to say to her.

1139
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:03,826
I'm gonna tell her you'll go back to her...

1140
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:06,822
and it'll be just the way
it was when you were first married...

1141
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:08,707
your romance, it's gonna be beautiful.

1142
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:10,746
I know how to talk to her,
especially to her.

1143
01:14:10,830 --> 01:14:13,344
Jimmy and Tommy are going down
to Tampa this weekend...

1144
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:14,658
to pick up something for me.

1145
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,263
Instead, you go with Jimmy.

1146
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:17,783
You come with me, we'll go down.

1147
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:20,338
Have a good time.
Take some time for yourself. Relax.

1148
01:14:20,430 --> 01:14:22,227
Sit in the sun. Take a couple days off.

1149
01:14:22,310 --> 01:14:24,187
 We'll have a good time.
 Enjoy yourselves.

1150
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:26,830
And when you come back,
you go back to Karen.

1151
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:29,102
Please, there's no other way.

1152
01:14:29,190 --> 01:14:31,784
 You're not gonna get a divorce.
We're not animali.

1153
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:34,338
No divorce. She'll never divorce him.

1154
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:38,868
She'll kill him, but she won't divorce him.

1155
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:44,582
You gonna pay us?

1156
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:53,588
 You gonna pay?
 Give us the fucking money!

1157
01:14:54,110 --> 01:14:56,066
I can't, I swear.

1158
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:58,784
Let's go.

1159
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:09,624
 We'll throw the bastard to the lions.
 No!

1160
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:12,383
What fucking lions?
I ain't going near any lions, Jimmy!

1161
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:14,779
 Let's throw him over the moat.
 All right.

1162
01:15:14,870 --> 01:15:16,189
I'll get the money!

1163
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:18,943
 They must really feed each other
to the lions down there...

1164
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:20,782
 because the guy gave the money right up.

1165
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:22,508
I swear to Christ, I'll get the money.

1166
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:24,581
 We got to spend the rest of the weekend
at the track.

1167
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:26,383
Yeah. They mean business.

1168
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:28,984
 Then, I couldn't believe what happened.

1169
01:15:29,390 --> 01:15:31,858
 When we got home,
we were all over the newspaper.

1170
01:15:31,950 --> 01:15:35,101
 At first, I didn't even know
why we got picked up.

1171
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:37,306
 Then I found out
that the guy we roughed up...

1172
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:40,700
 turned out to have a sister
working as a typist for the FBI.

1173
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:43,509
 Who could believe it?
Of all the fucking people.

1174
01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:46,787
 She gave up everybody.:
Jimmy, me, even her brother.

1175
01:15:48,150 --> 01:15:50,903
 It took the jury six hours
to bring us in guilty.

1176
01:15:51,030 --> 01:15:54,227
 The judge gave Jimmy and me 10 years
like he was giving away candy.

1177
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:56,870
...ten years in a federal penitentiary.

1178
01:15:57,070 --> 01:16:00,983
You will now be turned over
to the U.S. Attorney General's office.

1179
01:16:05,070 --> 01:16:06,708
Toast, guys.

1180
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:09,099
Good trip, good life, get out soon.

1181
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:10,987
Good trip, sweetheart.

1182
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:15,826
We'll watch the home front.

1183
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:19,585
Say hello to those blow job hacks.

1184
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:23,662
Yeah, motherfuck them
every chance you get.

1185
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:31,659
I'll call you when I get a chance.

1186
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:44,744
Now take me to jail.

1187
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:51,989
 In prison, dinner was always a big thing.

1188
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:55,666
 We had a pasta course,
and then we had a meat or a fish.

1189
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:59,103
 Paulie did the prep work.
He was doing a year for contempt...

1190
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:01,499
 and had this wonderful system
for doing the garlic.

1191
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:04,582
 He used a razor,
and he used to slice it so thin...

1192
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:07,389
 that it used to liquefy in the pan
with just a little oil.

1193
01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:09,426
 It was a very good system.

1194
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:12,098
 Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.

1195
01:17:12,190 --> 01:17:13,589
Get the smell?

1196
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:16,389
Three kinds of meat in the meatballs:

1197
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:18,426
veal, beef, and pork.

1198
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:20,860
Good, but you gotta have the pork.

1199
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:22,508
That's the flavor.

1200
01:17:22,590 --> 01:17:25,980
 I felt he used too many onions,
but it was still a very good sauce.

1201
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:28,789
Vinnie, don't put too many onions
in the sauce.

1202
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:31,384
I didn't put too much onions in, Paul.

1203
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:33,467
Put three small onions, that's all I did.

1204
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:36,189
Three onions? How many cans
of tomatoes you put in there?

1205
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:38,864
 I put two big cans.
 You don't need three onions.

1206
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:40,941
 Johnny Dio did the meat.

1207
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:43,590
 We had no broiler,
so Johnny did everything in pans.

1208
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:45,786
 It used to smell up the joint
something awful...

1209
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:48,782
 and the hacks used to die,
but he still cooked a great steak.

1210
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:51,304
 How do you like yours?
 Medium rare.

1211
01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:53,906
Medium rare. An aristocrat.

1212
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:57,985
 You know, when you think of prison
you get pictures in your mind...

1213
01:17:58,070 --> 01:18:01,619
 of all those old movies
with rows of guys behind bars.

1214
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:03,541
 It wasn't like that for wiseguys.

1215
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:06,349
 It really wasn't that bad,
excepting that I missed Jimmy...

1216
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:07,863
 who was doing his time in Atlanta.

1217
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:10,862
Give me two steaks
while you're in there, all right?

1218
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:15,948
 Everyone else in the joint was doing
real time, mixed together, living like pigs.

1219
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:19,028
 But we lived alone. We owned the joint.

1220
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:22,420
We batted them sons of bitches.
You couldn't recognize them.

1221
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:23,863
Good, they deserved it.

1222
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:27,226
 Even the hacks we couldn't bribe
would never rat on the guys we did.

1223
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:29,141
...had respect. People loved one another.

1224
01:18:29,230 --> 01:18:30,345
They left their doors open.

1225
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:31,499
Sorry it took so long.

1226
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:34,150
The skinny guard's getting to be
a real pain in the ass.

1227
01:18:34,230 --> 01:18:37,302
 We're gonna have to do something.
 I took care of him.

1228
01:18:37,390 --> 01:18:39,108
What'd you bring?

1229
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:40,623
 Bread.
 Good.

1230
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:43,180
 Fresh.
 Vinnie, I got your peppers and onions.

1231
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:45,545
Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese.

1232
01:18:45,630 --> 01:18:47,143
Come on, what else?

1233
01:18:47,230 --> 01:18:48,663
 Scotch.
 Nice.

1234
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:51,382
 Some red wine.
 Okay.

1235
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:53,587
 Now we can eat.
 I got some white, too.

1236
01:18:53,670 --> 01:18:55,422
Give me the white, too. Beautiful.

1237
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:58,388
Okay, boys, let's eat.
Come on, it's ready, Vinnie.

1238
01:18:58,950 --> 01:19:00,065
Some more bread.

1239
01:19:00,150 --> 01:19:02,903
Tomorrow we eat sandwiches.
You got to go on a diet, Vinnie.

1240
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:05,060
 You must be kidding.
 Believe me.

1241
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,342
What are you doing?

1242
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:22,027
I'll take that.

1243
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:26,744
 All right, I'll catch you guys later.
 Yeah.

1244
01:19:26,830 --> 01:19:29,060
You going for a walk in the park?

1245
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:33,542
 Okay, I'll catch you next week. Thanks.
 Okay.

1246
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:38,864
 Is there any more?
 No, that's it. Have a good weekend.

1247
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:39,780
 Thanks.
 You too, Henry.

1248
01:19:48,190 --> 01:19:49,339
Mrs. Hill, come here.

1249
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:50,545
Come on.

1250
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:55,781
You girls stay right here.

1251
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:59,381
 I want you to hold hands.
 Okay, go right up to the front.

1252
01:19:59,590 --> 01:20:01,501
 Let's go.
 How you doing?

1253
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:04,024
 Good, how are you?
 Very well, thank you.

1254
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:18,029
 What you talking about?
 I saw her name in the register.

1255
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:20,146
 Jesus Christ.
 You want her to visit you?

1256
01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:23,984
Let her stay up all night crying
and writing letters to the parole board.

1257
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:26,903
What am I doing here?
Where am I? I'm in jail.

1258
01:20:27,150 --> 01:20:29,300
I can't stop people from coming to see me.

1259
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:32,621
Good, let her sneak this stuff in
for you every week.

1260
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:37,147
 Let her fight these bastards every week!
 Look what you're doing! Stop it!

1261
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:39,744
I'm sorry.

1262
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:42,585
Let her sneak this shit in for you.

1263
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:45,387
Will you stop it, Karen?

1264
01:20:45,790 --> 01:20:48,258
 Let her do it!
 Stop it!

1265
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:59,341
Nobody's helping me. I'm all alone.

1266
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:02,186
Belle and Morrie are broke.

1267
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:05,701
I asked your friend Remo
for the money that he owes you.

1268
01:21:05,790 --> 01:21:07,189
You know what he told me?

1269
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:10,785
He told me to take my kids down
to the police station and get on welfare.

1270
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:12,781
It's gonna be okay.

1271
01:21:12,950 --> 01:21:16,943
Even Paulie, since he got out, I've never
seen him. I never see anybody anymore.

1272
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:19,783
It's only you and me.
That's what happens when you go away.

1273
01:21:19,870 --> 01:21:23,704
I told you that we're on our own.
Forget everybody else. Forget Paulie.

1274
01:21:24,670 --> 01:21:28,504
As long as he's on parole,
he doesn't want anybody doing anything.

1275
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:33,100
 I can't do it.
 Yes, you can. Listen to me.

1276
01:21:33,190 --> 01:21:35,750
All I need for you
is to keep bringing me the stuff.

1277
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:38,503
I got a guy in here from Pittsburgh
who'll help me move it.

1278
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:40,103
In a month we're gonna be fine.

1279
01:21:40,190 --> 01:21:42,579
 We won't need anybody.
 I'm afraid.

1280
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:44,626
I'm afraid if Paulie finds out....

1281
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:46,029
Don't worry about him.

1282
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:49,546
He is not helping us out.
Is he putting any food on the table?

1283
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:52,109
We've gotta help each other.

1284
01:21:52,190 --> 01:21:55,705
We've just gotta be really careful
while we do it.

1285
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:02,340
I don't want to hear a word
about her anymore.

1286
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:03,465
Never.

1287
01:22:27,790 --> 01:22:29,382
Daddy!

1288
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:33,180
 We missed you.
 Are you here to stay?

1289
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:36,740
Did you see our pictures?
I did the one with the house and rainbow.

1290
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:38,263
I did the sun.

1291
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:42,144
My chorus concert is in two weeks.
Are you coming?

1292
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:44,747
Do you like the house?

1293
01:22:45,950 --> 01:22:47,941
Karen, get packed.
We're moving out of here.

1294
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:49,065
With what?

1295
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:52,148
Don't worry with what.
Just start looking for a new house.

1296
01:22:52,230 --> 01:22:55,745
I got to go to Pittsburgh in the morning.
Those guys there owe me $15,000.

1297
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:57,741
We'll be all right. I got things lined up.

1298
01:22:57,830 --> 01:23:00,583
Pittsburgh? You have to go see
your parole officer tomorrow.

1299
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:03,468
Don't worry about it.
Everything's gonna be fine.

1300
01:23:04,030 --> 01:23:06,305
 Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?
 Me!

1301
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:17,703
What do you want?

1302
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:19,906
Sweetheart, let Mommy eat.

1303
01:23:23,230 --> 01:23:25,983
You look good.
Did you eat this good in the joint?

1304
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:29,827
I don't want any more of that shit.

1305
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:30,979
What shit?

1306
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:33,664
 Just stay away from the garbage.
 Look, Paulie

1307
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:37,026
I'm not talking about what you did inside.
You did what you had to do.

1308
01:23:37,110 --> 01:23:39,704
I'm talking about now. From now.
Here and now.

1309
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:43,149
 Why would I get into that?
 Don't make a jerk out of me.

1310
01:23:43,230 --> 01:23:44,743
Just don't do it.

1311
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:51,222
I want to talk to you about Jimmy.
You gotta watch out for him.

1312
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:54,029
He's a good earner, but he's wild,
takes too many chances.

1313
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:56,544
I know Jimmy. You think
I would take chances like him?

1314
01:23:56,630 --> 01:23:58,302
Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy.

1315
01:23:58,390 --> 01:24:00,142
He's a cowboy.
He's got too much to prove.

1316
01:24:00,230 --> 01:24:01,902
You gotta watch out for kids like this.

1317
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:04,584
I know what they are.
I only use them for certain things.

1318
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:07,184
I ain't gonna get fucked like Gribbs,
you understand?

1319
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:11,582
Gribbs is 70 years old. The fucking guy's
gonna die in prison. I don't need that.

1320
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:15,624
So I'm warning everybody. Everybody.
Could be my son, could be anybody.

1321
01:24:15,870 --> 01:24:18,509
Gribbs got 20 years just
for saying hello to some fuck...

1322
01:24:18,590 --> 01:24:20,581
who was sneaking behind his back,
selling junk.

1323
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:23,138
I don't need that.
That won't happen to me, understand?

1324
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:25,425
You know you're out early
because I got you a job.

1325
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:27,466
I don't need this heat,
you understand that?

1326
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:31,338
You see anybody fucking around
with this shit you're gonna tell me, right?

1327
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:32,579
That means anybody.

1328
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:33,705
 All right.
 Yeah?

1329
01:24:33,790 --> 01:24:35,303
Yeah. Of course.

1330
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:46,343
 Took me about a week of sneaking around
before I could unload the Pittsburgh stuff.

1331
01:24:46,430 --> 01:24:48,898
 But when I did, it was a real score.

1332
01:24:48,990 --> 01:24:51,458
 I started using Sandy's place
to mix the stuff.

1333
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:53,984
 And even with Sandy snorting
more than she mixed...

1334
01:24:54,070 --> 01:24:56,664
 I could see that
this was a really good business.

1335
01:24:56,750 --> 01:24:59,059
 I made $12,000 in my second week.

1336
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:02,667
 I had a down payment on my house
and things were really rolling.

1337
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:06,823
 All I had to do was every once in a while
tell Sandy that I loved her.

1338
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:12,226
 But it was perfect, I'm telling you.

1339
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:14,778
 As long as I kept getting
the stuff from Pittsburgh...

1340
01:25:14,870 --> 01:25:16,542
 I knew Paulie would never find out.

1341
01:25:16,630 --> 01:25:20,384
 Within a couple of weeks,
it got so big I needed some help.

1342
01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:23,383
 So I got Jimmy and Tommy
to come in with me.

1343
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:25,308
It's fucking great.

1344
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:26,584
Mr. Conway.

1345
01:25:32,190 --> 01:25:34,021
 Bring your pay slips?
 Yeah.

1346
01:25:36,950 --> 01:25:39,180
Four and a half months of dirt.

1347
01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:42,187
 It's so good.
 I did it.

1348
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:45,824
 Do you love it?
 It's wonderful.

1349
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:49,939
And this we just had to have made special.
Go ahead, sit in it, Belle.

1350
01:25:50,030 --> 01:25:52,419
The others you couldn't even sit in.

1351
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:54,143
Okay, you ready?

1352
01:25:54,230 --> 01:25:56,300
Watch the wall with the rock.

1353
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:06,349
The electricians did it special. Come on.

1354
01:26:07,470 --> 01:26:09,222
Come on. All right.

1355
01:26:09,310 --> 01:26:12,825
This was imported. It came in two pieces.
Do you believe what they can do?

1356
01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:14,263
It's nice, huh?

1357
01:26:14,350 --> 01:26:16,386
Henry, come over here.
Did you and Jimmy talk?

1358
01:26:16,470 --> 01:26:18,904
I talked to him,
and he's looking into everything.

1359
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:22,141
This'll make the Air France haul
look like goddamn peanuts.

1360
01:26:22,230 --> 01:26:24,460
 Come on.
 He's gonna do it, right?

1361
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:26,347
I told you. He'll check everything out.

1362
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:29,069
He's looking into it.
We'll see what happens. No promises.

1363
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:33,189
I know. Do you understand?
There's millions in there. And I've been...

1364
01:26:33,270 --> 01:26:36,865
bleeding for this caper, been cultivating
this son of a bitch for two years.

1365
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:39,942
He owes me $20,000. Once in a lifetime.
I could retire.

1366
01:26:40,030 --> 01:26:43,818
No more nut every week.
No more bullshit. My dream comes true.

1367
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:45,821
Morrie, let's get a drink.

1368
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:49,268
 These are the guys that Jimmy
put together for what turned out to be...

1369
01:26:49,350 --> 01:26:53,059
 the biggest heist in American history.:
the Lufthansa heist.

1370
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:56,949
 Tommy and Carbone were gonna grab
the outside guard...

1371
01:26:57,030 --> 01:26:59,464
 and make him get us in the front door.

1372
01:27:00,670 --> 01:27:03,787
 Frenchy and Joe Buddha
had to round up the workers.

1373
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:08,309
 Johnny Roastbeef had to keep them
all tied up and away from the alarms.

1374
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:11,105
 Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.

1375
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:14,660
 He used to hang around the lounge
and play guitar. Everybody loved Stacks.

1376
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:17,218
 What he was supposed to do
was steal the panel truck...

1377
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:20,302
 and afterwards compact it
by a friend of ours out in Jersey.

1378
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:22,745
 Only Morrie was driving us nuts.

1379
01:27:22,830 --> 01:27:24,741
Morrie, have a drink and shut up.

1380
01:27:24,830 --> 01:27:27,947
 Just because he set this up,
he felt he could bust Jimmy's balls...

1381
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:30,498
 for an advance on the money
we were going to steal.

1382
01:27:30,590 --> 01:27:34,060
 He didn't mean anything by it.
That's just the way he was.

1383
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:44,589
 I had everybody working for me.
Even our old baby sitter, Lois Byrd.

1384
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:48,869
Did you have a good flight?

1385
01:27:48,950 --> 01:27:51,510
I hate Pittsburgh.
Where did you find such creeps?

1386
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:53,501
Come on, they're not that bad.

1387
01:27:54,590 --> 01:27:56,387
And it's worth it, isn't it?

1388
01:27:56,670 --> 01:27:59,059
Is this the same baby you used last week?

1389
01:27:59,150 --> 01:28:02,142
No, that one was my sister's.
This is Deirdra's.

1390
01:28:03,070 --> 01:28:04,264
Big yawn.

1391
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:06,022
She looks just like you.

1392
01:28:06,670 --> 01:28:08,900
That's what the stewardess said.

1393
01:28:21,030 --> 01:28:22,941
Take it easy, Sandy.

1394
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:25,703
Come on, give me a break.
You got enough here to go around.

1395
01:28:25,790 --> 01:28:29,100
You got all day. Just make it last,
all right? Take it easy.

1396
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:31,267
 I got to go.
 Where are you going?

1397
01:28:31,350 --> 01:28:35,309
Don't start. You know I gotta go
do this thing. Fuck, where are my keys?

1398
01:28:36,550 --> 01:28:37,903
Over there.

1399
01:28:37,990 --> 01:28:39,582
It's a mess. It's like a pig pen.

1400
01:28:39,670 --> 01:28:41,706
What do you think
I got you the dishwasher for?

1401
01:28:41,790 --> 01:28:43,667
I hate doing the dishes. Fucks up my nails.

1402
01:28:43,750 --> 01:28:45,547
How could you hate it?
You got to be smart.

1403
01:28:45,630 --> 01:28:48,781
Look at all this powder around here.
That could put us away forever.

1404
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:51,020
 Loosen up.
 What are you doing?

1405
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:55,221
 You know, I gotta....
 You don't have to go anywhere.

1406
01:28:56,310 --> 01:28:57,789
Make them wait.

1407
01:29:06,710 --> 01:29:10,339
 Nobody knows for sure just how much
was taken in the daring pre dawn raid...

1408
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:13,024
 at the Lufthansa cargo terminal
at Kennedy Airport.

1409
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:16,705
 The FBI says $2 million,
Port Authority Police say $4 million

1410
01:29:19,910 --> 01:29:21,946
Jimmy!

1411
01:29:22,030 --> 01:29:23,861
Those sons of bitches!

1412
01:29:23,950 --> 01:29:26,259
 ...from the scene of the heist at JFK.

1413
01:29:26,350 --> 01:29:29,865
 It looks like a big one. Maybe the biggest
this town has ever seen.

1414
01:29:31,670 --> 01:29:33,740
Come here, you! Come here!

1415
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:37,384
Look at this genius. This genius!

1416
01:29:41,630 --> 01:29:43,461
Merry Christmas.

1417
01:29:48,110 --> 01:29:50,385
 Hello, who's this?
 That's my wife.

1418
01:29:50,990 --> 01:29:54,187
Come here.
I want to show you something, Jimmy.

1419
01:29:56,750 --> 01:29:58,149
Isn't she gorgeous?

1420
01:29:58,230 --> 01:30:01,302
I bought it for my wife.
It's a coupe. I love that car.

1421
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:06,788
What did I tell you?
I talked to you before, didn't I?

1422
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:08,223
Didn't I say what was going on?

1423
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:10,426
Didn't I say not to go buy anything
for a while?

1424
01:30:10,510 --> 01:30:13,422
 The fucking car?
 It's a wedding gift from my mother.

1425
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:15,626
It's under her name. I just got married.

1426
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:18,463
 I love that car.
 Excuse me, darling, for just a second.

1427
01:30:18,550 --> 01:30:20,825
 I just got married.
 Are you nuts?

1428
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:23,299
 What are you getting excited for?
 Are you stupid?

1429
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:26,063
We got a million bulls out there.
Everybody's watching us.

1430
01:30:26,150 --> 01:30:27,947
And you get a fucking car. I'm excited?

1431
01:30:28,030 --> 01:30:30,225
It's under my mother's name.
It's a wedding gift.

1432
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:32,141
I don't give a fuck. Are you stupid?

1433
01:30:32,230 --> 01:30:34,380
Didn't you hear what I said?
Don't buy anything.

1434
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:38,065
Don't get anything. Nothing big.
What's the matter with you?

1435
01:30:38,230 --> 01:30:39,709
What are you getting excited for?

1436
01:30:39,790 --> 01:30:43,180
Because you're going to get us all
fucking pinched. What are you, stupid?

1437
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:45,909
 What's the matter with you?
 I apologize.

1438
01:30:47,230 --> 01:30:50,302
 I'm sorry.
 What the fuck is the matter with you?

1439
01:30:52,510 --> 01:30:53,784
I'm sorry.

1440
01:30:56,310 --> 01:30:59,666
I'm sorry, Jimmy.
It's under my mother's name.

1441
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:02,949
What'd you say? You being
a fucking wise guy with me?

1442
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:05,828
 I'm sorry. I apologize.
 What did I tell you?

1443
01:31:06,230 --> 01:31:09,188
What did I tell you?
You don't buy anything, you hear me?

1444
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:10,908
Don't buy anything!

1445
01:31:10,990 --> 01:31:12,548
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1446
01:31:15,630 --> 01:31:17,985
The fat fuck, he ought to wear a sign.

1447
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:27,419
I can't believe this.
Are you stupid or what?

1448
01:31:27,510 --> 01:31:28,784
Excuse me.

1449
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:30,702
 What's the matter?
 Take it off.

1450
01:31:30,790 --> 01:31:33,668
 Why? What's the matter?
 Take it off!

1451
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:39,186
Didn't I tell you not to get anything big
and not to attract attention?

1452
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:42,307
In two days, one guy gets a Caddy
and one gets a $20,000 mink.

1453
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:44,267
 Bring it fucking back.
 I'll bring it back.

1454
01:31:44,350 --> 01:31:47,786
I don't care what you do.
Bring it where you got it before.

1455
01:31:47,870 --> 01:31:50,623
 Get it out of here!
 All right. Let's go, honey.

1456
01:31:54,590 --> 01:31:56,626
Shut the fuck up and let's go.

1457
01:31:59,550 --> 01:32:01,984
This drink here is better than sex, babe.

1458
01:32:03,870 --> 01:32:07,909
I'm gonna go see Stacks. Don't you look
at anybody or I'll fucking kill you.

1459
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:12,063
He's so jealous. If I even look
at anyone else, he'll kill me.

1460
01:32:12,270 --> 01:32:13,703
That's great.

1461
01:32:13,830 --> 01:32:16,788
Tell them all to relax.
Don't attract attention.

1462
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:21,581
I've been looking all over for you.

1463
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:23,262
How are you? Merry Christmas.

1464
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:25,306
Listen, I need the money.

1465
01:32:25,670 --> 01:32:29,060
 Morrie, relax, okay? It's Christmas.
 Jimmy, I need the money.

1466
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:31,300
I'm relaxing. I need the money.

1467
01:32:31,390 --> 01:32:34,348
 I did what I had to do. I need the money.
 Not tonight, Morrie.

1468
01:32:34,430 --> 01:32:38,264
Listen, I did my caper. He owes me.
Everybody's flashing their stuff.

1469
01:32:38,350 --> 01:32:41,069
Evidently, they got their money.
I'm wearing the same shit.

1470
01:32:41,150 --> 01:32:44,460
 Just not tonight.
 They're wearing it. I gotta talk to him.

1471
01:32:46,710 --> 01:32:49,224
I got $500,000 coming to me.

1472
01:32:49,310 --> 01:32:51,744
The biggest fucking bundle
he ever made in his life.

1473
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:54,424
Morrie, I'll go talk to him.
Go have a drink, all right?

1474
01:32:54,510 --> 01:32:56,580
 I'll talk to him.
 It's poison in my eyes.

1475
01:32:56,670 --> 01:32:59,468
 Morris, baby, are you all right?
 No, I'm not.

1476
01:33:04,990 --> 01:33:08,221
Christmas. Your share. Just a little taste.

1477
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:12,544
We did it!

1478
01:33:15,430 --> 01:33:17,068
 Jimmy.
 Yeah.

1479
01:33:17,670 --> 01:33:19,581
 Yeah, who is it?
 It's me.

1480
01:33:19,670 --> 01:33:21,228
Pete? One second.

1481
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:25,021
Don't do what Frankie and Johnny did.
Don't be a moron with the money.

1482
01:33:25,110 --> 01:33:26,862
 Do what's right, you understand?
 Yeah.

1483
01:33:27,590 --> 01:33:30,058
Karen, Judy, Ruth, come here!

1484
01:33:30,590 --> 01:33:33,184
I got the most expensive tree they had.

1485
01:33:34,590 --> 01:33:38,060
 What do you think, Mommy?
 I love them all.

1486
01:33:38,270 --> 01:33:39,828
I love the gold outfit.

1487
01:33:39,910 --> 01:33:41,662
 Merry Christmas.
 Thank you.

1488
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:43,149
 What?
 Merry Christmas.

1489
01:33:43,230 --> 01:33:44,504
And?

1490
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:46,349
Happy Hanukkah.

1491
01:33:47,190 --> 01:33:50,307
 Very funny.
 Go get yourself something nice, okay?

1492
01:33:58,310 --> 01:34:02,462
 Lufthansa should have been
our ultimate score. The heist of a lifetime.

1493
01:34:03,030 --> 01:34:06,147
 $6 million in cash.
More than enough to go around.

1494
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:17,149
Yo, Stacks!

1495
01:34:17,510 --> 01:34:20,024
Open up! What's up? What're you doing?

1496
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:29,705
What's with you? He ain't ready.
I knew you wouldn't be ready.

1497
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:33,100
 You didn't bring any coffee?
 What do I look like, a fucking caterer?

1498
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:36,341
Frankie will make coffee.
Go ahead, Frankie, make coffee.

1499
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:41,020
Thought you had
one of your bitches in here.

1500
01:34:41,110 --> 01:34:43,419
Yeah, I did. Where the fuck is she?

1501
01:34:44,390 --> 01:34:47,302
Always got these hot books around,
or a bitch, or something.

1502
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:48,618
What time is it?

1503
01:34:48,710 --> 01:34:52,589
 It's 11:30. We had to be there by 9:00.
 I'll be ready in a minute.

1504
01:34:52,670 --> 01:34:56,504
You're always fucking late.
You'd be late for your own fucking funeral.

1505
01:35:01,190 --> 01:35:04,944
What the fuck you looking at?
Make that coffee to go. Let's go.

1506
01:35:07,950 --> 01:35:09,827
What the fuck you doing? It's a joke.

1507
01:35:09,910 --> 01:35:12,822
Put the fucking pot down.
You gonna take the coffee?

1508
01:35:31,670 --> 01:35:33,547
 Stacks was always crazy.

1509
01:35:33,870 --> 01:35:37,465
 Instead of getting rid of the truck
as he was supposed to, he got stoned...

1510
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:41,987
 went to his girlfriend's, and by the time
he woke up, the cops had found the truck.

1511
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:44,140
 It was all over the television.

1512
01:35:44,230 --> 01:35:47,222
 They even said they came up
with prints off the wheel.

1513
01:35:47,790 --> 01:35:51,100
 It was just a matter of time
before they got to Stacks.

1514
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:04,108
I gotta talk to you.

1515
01:36:04,350 --> 01:36:06,818
 Have a drink.
 Have a drink. Come on.

1516
01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:10,939
Have a drink. What you doing?
It's an occasion. Have a drink.

1517
01:36:12,230 --> 01:36:14,186
I still gotta talk to you.

1518
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:15,545
What?

1519
01:36:15,630 --> 01:36:18,098
 What happened with Stacks?
 Don't worry about that.

1520
01:36:18,190 --> 01:36:21,819
 There's feds all over the place.
 So what? Where are they gonna go?

1521
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:24,744
 It's in the papers.
 He's worried.

1522
01:36:25,230 --> 01:36:26,982
What are you worried about?

1523
01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:30,426
The television and the newspapers.
All the shit's out there.

1524
01:36:30,510 --> 01:36:33,627
 What are you worried about?
 You worry too much.

1525
01:36:33,910 --> 01:36:36,504
Everything is beautiful.
There's nothing to worry about.

1526
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:38,945
 Didn't you tell him?
 I didn't tell him yet.

1527
01:36:39,030 --> 01:36:40,429
 What?
 Guess what?

1528
01:36:41,950 --> 01:36:43,588
They're gonna make him.

1529
01:36:45,150 --> 01:36:46,981
Paulie's going to make you?

1530
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:48,899
Tommy.

1531
01:36:48,990 --> 01:36:51,504
They opened up the books.
Paulie got the okay.

1532
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:54,229
You believe that?
This little guinea bastard.

1533
01:36:55,110 --> 01:36:59,422
He's gonna get made. We're gonna work
for this guy one day. He's gonna be a boss.

1534
01:37:00,390 --> 01:37:01,982
I can't believe it.

1535
01:37:02,070 --> 01:37:04,220
I'm really happy for you.
Great. Congratulations.

1536
01:37:04,310 --> 01:37:06,221
Motherfuckers, we got them now.

1537
01:37:06,990 --> 01:37:11,108
Jimmy, I've been looking all over for you.
Can I talk to you a second?

1538
01:37:11,830 --> 01:37:14,139
I mastermind the goddamn thing,
I'm left with dick.

1539
01:37:14,230 --> 01:37:17,620
They'd be up a creek if not for me.
Fuck him ! I want my money.

1540
01:37:17,830 --> 01:37:19,900
I want my money! I've had it up to here!

1541
01:37:19,990 --> 01:37:22,265
That cheap cigarette hijacker.

1542
01:37:22,390 --> 01:37:25,063
 Fuck him ! I want my money!
 Good. Go tell him.

1543
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:30,383
You're gonna keep your mouth shut,
or what?

1544
01:37:31,950 --> 01:37:33,827
Morrie, you're gonna get your money.

1545
01:37:33,910 --> 01:37:36,265
You just got to stop busting balls.

1546
01:37:36,670 --> 01:37:39,503
All right? Look at me. You hear me?
Look at me, okay?

1547
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:41,660
Everything's going to be fine.

1548
01:37:47,550 --> 01:37:48,585
Henry.

1549
01:37:53,950 --> 01:37:57,704
Sweetheart, half mick, half guinea?
I'll sing with an Italian accent.

1550
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:41,101
 I could see for the first time
that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.

1551
01:38:41,190 --> 01:38:44,341
 His mind was going in
eight different directions at once.

1552
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:48,819
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?

1553
01:38:49,070 --> 01:38:50,423
Morrie? Him?

1554
01:38:50,950 --> 01:38:53,783
 That's when I knew
Jimmy was going to whack Morrie.

1555
01:38:53,870 --> 01:38:58,022
 That's how it happens. That's how fast
it takes for a guy to get whacked.

1556
01:38:58,670 --> 01:39:01,025
He's a nut job. He talks to everybody.

1557
01:39:01,110 --> 01:39:04,500
Acts like a jerk in his commercials.
Nobody listens to what he says.

1558
01:39:04,590 --> 01:39:07,662
Nobody fucking cares what he says,
he talks so much.

1559
01:39:07,870 --> 01:39:10,430
Make sure you bring him here tonight.

1560
01:39:10,550 --> 01:39:12,108
 Okay?
 All right.

1561
01:39:14,430 --> 01:39:17,263
Start like this. Sorry.
Did I get you in the eye?

1562
01:39:17,350 --> 01:39:19,306
Stop breaking my balls, all right?

1563
01:39:19,390 --> 01:39:21,267
 I was just stalling for time.

1564
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:25,823
 I knew I still had till 8.:00 or 9.:00
to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.

1565
01:39:26,030 --> 01:39:29,943
 But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew,
I was going along with the program.

1566
01:39:30,030 --> 01:39:33,659
I pulled his hair out of his fucking head.
I bit him. He's out cold.

1567
01:39:35,710 --> 01:39:37,940
I'm enraged.
I wanted to kill this little fuck.

1568
01:39:38,030 --> 01:39:40,828
I walk away.
We start to go in the fucking joint.

1569
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:44,421
I don't want to turn around.
Jimmy's going like this to me.

1570
01:39:44,790 --> 01:39:46,587
I don't want to fucking turn around.

1571
01:39:46,670 --> 01:39:50,458
I don't want to turn around. He picks up
his fucking head, he says....

1572
01:39:51,350 --> 01:39:53,147
I said, "Don't say it."

1573
01:39:57,830 --> 01:39:59,104
"Jerkoff! "

1574
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:05,186
What are you going to do? What?
I fucking fly at him.

1575
01:40:05,270 --> 01:40:08,182
I got him and I'm banging his head,
banging his fucking face.

1576
01:40:08,270 --> 01:40:10,022
I'm pulling his hair out of his head.

1577
01:40:10,110 --> 01:40:13,068
I beat him to a pulp. To a pulp I beat him.

1578
01:40:13,150 --> 01:40:16,028
He's laying there full of fucking blood.
I'm out of breath.

1579
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:18,624
Forget about tonight. Forget about it.

1580
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:21,386
 It was a load off my mind.

1581
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:23,658
 Poor bastard.

1582
01:40:23,750 --> 01:40:26,059
 He never knew how close he'd come
to getting killed.

1583
01:40:26,150 --> 01:40:29,062
 Even if I told him,
he would have never believed me.

1584
01:40:30,510 --> 01:40:34,344
 Jimmy, could I talk to you now?
 You're a pisser. A real pisser.

1585
01:40:34,910 --> 01:40:38,107
Want to talk now? Okay, let's talk.
Let's get it over with.

1586
01:40:38,190 --> 01:40:41,102
I've never met a ball buster like you,
my whole life.

1587
01:40:41,190 --> 01:40:43,226
Who loves you more than I do?

1588
01:40:43,310 --> 01:40:46,507
 I'd do anything for you.
 Except to stop busting my balls.

1589
01:40:47,390 --> 01:40:49,745
 Let's go have coffee.
 Want to go to the diner?

1590
01:40:49,830 --> 01:40:52,139
We'll go to the diner on the boulevard.

1591
01:40:52,670 --> 01:40:55,548
 Which diner?
 Rockaway Boulevard. It's open 24 hours.

1592
01:40:55,630 --> 01:40:57,746
 They got Danishes?
 They got everything.

1593
01:40:57,830 --> 01:41:00,105
Let's pick up some Danishes for Belle.

1594
01:41:00,670 --> 01:41:04,663
Hear about the points we were shaving
up in Boston? It's terrific. Nunzio

1595
01:41:12,550 --> 01:41:14,108
I thought he'd never shut up.

1596
01:41:14,190 --> 01:41:15,862
What a pain in the ass.

1597
01:41:15,950 --> 01:41:18,748
 What'll we do with him?
 Chop him up and get rid of the car.

1598
01:41:18,830 --> 01:41:20,741
Call me when you're through.

1599
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:23,219
 Frank, let's chop him up.
 All right.

1600
01:41:23,310 --> 01:41:25,824
Where you going,
you dizzy motherfucker, you?

1601
01:41:25,910 --> 01:41:26,945
You said chop him up.

1602
01:41:27,030 --> 01:41:30,306
At Charlie's, not here!
Where are you gonna chop him here?

1603
01:41:31,230 --> 01:41:33,824
Come on, what are you doing?
Get out of here.

1604
01:41:33,910 --> 01:41:35,980
I got a better shot letting him drive.

1605
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:37,822
The car's cold.

1606
01:41:37,910 --> 01:41:41,346
Get the fuck out of here!
What, warm it up? Get out of here!

1607
01:41:42,150 --> 01:41:44,584
 Who is it?
 It's Belle. Open up.

1608
01:41:44,670 --> 01:41:46,308
It's Belle. Let me in.

1609
01:41:47,150 --> 01:41:50,859
Morris didn't come home. He's missing.
I know something's happened.

1610
01:41:50,950 --> 01:41:52,224
Calm down.

1611
01:41:52,510 --> 01:41:54,899
He's missing! I know something happened.

1612
01:41:54,990 --> 01:41:57,185
He's probably drunk
and fell asleep somewhere.

1613
01:41:57,270 --> 01:42:00,865
In 27 years, he's never been away all night
without calling.

1614
01:42:00,950 --> 01:42:03,703
I know something's happened.
I know you know.

1615
01:42:03,790 --> 01:42:07,260
Let me get changed.
I'll take you home, then look for him.

1616
01:42:07,430 --> 01:42:10,581
 I've been home! I've been on the phone  
 He's playing cards.

1617
01:42:13,830 --> 01:42:16,264
 What'll I tell Belle?
 Who gives a fuck?

1618
01:42:17,110 --> 01:42:20,466
Tell her he ran off with some broad.
What do you care?

1619
01:42:20,550 --> 01:42:22,586
 Watch this.
 Don't fuck with them.

1620
01:42:22,670 --> 01:42:24,626
I do it all the time. I'll bust their balls.

1621
01:42:24,710 --> 01:42:27,463
Don't give them the satisfaction,
the fucks.

1622
01:42:29,830 --> 01:42:32,060
Come on, fuckos. Let's go for a ride.

1623
01:42:33,310 --> 01:42:34,982
Keep them up all night.

1624
01:42:35,870 --> 01:42:37,383
I'll see you later.

1625
01:43:24,990 --> 01:43:28,107
 Jimmy was cutting every link
between himself and the robbery...

1626
01:43:28,190 --> 01:43:30,499
 but it had nothing to do with me.

1627
01:43:40,590 --> 01:43:43,741
 I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me
some Christmas money.

1628
01:43:45,470 --> 01:43:47,779
 From then on, I kept my mouth shut.

1629
01:43:47,870 --> 01:43:51,658
 I knew Jimmy. He had the cash. It was his.

1630
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:54,947
 He kicked some money upstairs to Paulie,
but that was it.

1631
01:43:56,030 --> 01:43:59,386
 It made him sick to turn the money over
to the guys who stole it.

1632
01:43:59,470 --> 01:44:02,268
 He'd rather whack them.
Anyway, what did I care?

1633
01:44:02,350 --> 01:44:04,181
 I wasn't asking for anything.

1634
01:44:04,270 --> 01:44:07,865
 And Jimmy was making nice money
through my Pittsburgh connections.

1635
01:44:08,310 --> 01:44:12,189
 Still, months after the robbery
they were finding bodies all over.

1636
01:44:33,310 --> 01:44:36,029
 When they found Carbone
in the meat truck...

1637
01:44:36,110 --> 01:44:37,748
 he was frozen so stiff...

1638
01:44:37,830 --> 01:44:40,822
 it took them two days
to thaw him out for the autopsy.

1639
01:44:45,470 --> 01:44:47,540
 Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy.

1640
01:44:47,910 --> 01:44:51,425
 He was like a kid. We had money
coming in through my Pittsburgh people...

1641
01:44:51,510 --> 01:44:54,900
 and even after a while,
the Lufthansa thing began to calm down.

1642
01:44:55,070 --> 01:44:57,220
 What made Jimmy so happy
that morning...

1643
01:44:57,310 --> 01:45:00,222
 was that this was the day
that Tommy was being made.

1644
01:45:00,550 --> 01:45:03,462
 Jimmy was so excited,
you'd think he was being made.

1645
01:45:04,030 --> 01:45:06,590
 He must have made four calls
to Tommy's house.

1646
01:45:06,750 --> 01:45:10,629
 They had a signal set up, so he'd know
the minute the ceremony was over.

1647
01:45:11,390 --> 01:45:13,506
 Ma, where are you?
 Here I am.

1648
01:45:14,110 --> 01:45:16,578
 You're home.
 Home? I'm leaving.

1649
01:45:16,990 --> 01:45:19,504
 You look lovely.
 I look good, huh?

1650
01:45:19,590 --> 01:45:22,866
You look wonderful. Be careful.
Congratulations.

1651
01:45:23,510 --> 01:45:26,741
I love you. Don't paint
any more religious pictures, please.

1652
01:45:26,830 --> 01:45:28,468
 God be with you.
 Bye, Ma.

1653
01:45:28,550 --> 01:45:30,859
 We always called each other goodfellas.

1654
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:32,588
 You'd say to somebody.:

1655
01:45:32,670 --> 01:45:36,709
 "You'll like this guy. He's all right.
He's a goodfella, one of us. "

1656
01:45:37,070 --> 01:45:38,389
 You understand?

1657
01:45:39,030 --> 01:45:41,260
 We were goodfellas. Wiseguys.

1658
01:45:43,630 --> 01:45:46,906
 But Jimmy and I could never be made
because we had Irish blood.

1659
01:45:46,990 --> 01:45:49,379
 It didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.

1660
01:45:49,630 --> 01:45:53,464
 To become a member of a crew,
you've got to be 100% Italian...

1661
01:45:53,550 --> 01:45:56,701
 so they can trace your relatives
back to the old country.

1662
01:46:03,470 --> 01:46:05,779
 It's the highest honor they can give you.

1663
01:46:05,870 --> 01:46:08,338
 It means you belong
to a family and a crew.

1664
01:46:08,630 --> 01:46:11,064
 It means nobody can fuck around
with you.

1665
01:46:11,550 --> 01:46:13,939
 It also means you could
fuck around with anybody...

1666
01:46:14,030 --> 01:46:16,419
 just as long as they aren't also a member.

1667
01:46:16,510 --> 01:46:19,820
 It's like a license to steal.
A license to do anything.

1668
01:46:21,910 --> 01:46:23,866
How many years ago
since you were made?

1669
01:46:23,950 --> 01:46:26,669
 I'm an old timer. 30 years ago.
 Thirty years?

1670
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:30,868
Brings back a lot of memories.
Pike's Peak was a pimple then, wasn't it?

1671
01:46:33,990 --> 01:46:36,902
 As far as Jimmy was concerned,
with Tommy being made...

1672
01:46:36,990 --> 01:46:39,299
 it was like we were all being made.

1673
01:46:40,150 --> 01:46:42,710
 We would now have
one of our own as a member.

1674
01:46:57,910 --> 01:46:59,502
  Who's this?
 This is Vinnie.

1675
01:46:59,590 --> 01:47:02,388
Vinnie. What happened?
Did we get straightened out?

1676
01:47:02,470 --> 01:47:05,428
 No, we had a problem.
We tried to do everything we could.

1677
01:47:05,510 --> 01:47:06,545
What do you mean?

1678
01:47:06,630 --> 01:47:10,623
 You know what I mean. He's gone,
and we couldn't do nothing about it.

1679
01:47:12,470 --> 01:47:14,301
  That's it.
 What do you mean?

1680
01:47:14,390 --> 01:47:15,709
 He's gone.

1681
01:47:17,590 --> 01:47:18,659
 That's it.

1682
01:47:23,310 --> 01:47:25,983
I knew it! I can't fucking believe it.

1683
01:47:35,990 --> 01:47:38,060
 What happened?
 They fucking whacked him.

1684
01:47:38,150 --> 01:47:39,265
Fuck.

1685
01:47:54,470 --> 01:47:56,062
Are you all right?

1686
01:48:02,870 --> 01:48:05,304
 It was revenge for Billy Batts...

1687
01:48:05,390 --> 01:48:07,187
 and a lot of other things.

1688
01:48:07,270 --> 01:48:08,305
And that's that.

1689
01:48:08,390 --> 01:48:10,779
 There was nothing we could do about it.

1690
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:13,464
 Batts was a made man
and Tommy wasn't.

1691
01:48:14,070 --> 01:48:15,981
 We had to sit still and take it.

1692
01:48:16,070 --> 01:48:19,346
 It was among the Italians.
It was real greaseball shit.

1693
01:48:31,510 --> 01:48:33,307
 They even shot Tommy in the face...

1694
01:48:33,390 --> 01:48:36,746
 so his mother couldn't give him
an open coffin at the funeral.

1695
01:49:22,150 --> 01:49:25,506
 I was gonna be busy all day.
I had to drop off some guns at Jimmy's...

1696
01:49:25,590 --> 01:49:27,342
 to match some silencers he had.

1697
01:49:27,430 --> 01:49:30,388
 I had to pick up my brother at the hospital
and drive him home.

1698
01:49:30,470 --> 01:49:32,938
 I had to pick up
some new Pittsburgh stuff for Lois...

1699
01:49:33,030 --> 01:49:36,102
 to fly down to some customers
I had near Atlanta.

1700
01:49:46,910 --> 01:49:50,300
 Right away, I knew he didn't want them,
and I'd be stuck for the money.

1701
01:49:50,390 --> 01:49:53,939
 I only bought them because
he wanted them, and now he didn't.

1702
01:49:54,670 --> 01:49:58,060
What good are these? None of them fit.
What's the matter with you?

1703
01:49:58,150 --> 01:49:59,378
I'm not paying for it.

1704
01:49:59,470 --> 01:50:02,985
 I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was
so pissed off, he didn't even say goodbye.

1705
01:50:03,070 --> 01:50:05,300
Stop the drugs. They're making
your mind into mush!

1706
01:50:05,390 --> 01:50:06,823
 You hear me?
 I'll take them back.

1707
01:50:19,990 --> 01:50:21,901
 My Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.

1708
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:25,539
 Since I would see them in the afternoon
to pick up a delivery...

1709
01:50:25,630 --> 01:50:28,064
 I was pretty sure I'd get my money back.

1710
01:50:46,310 --> 01:50:47,425
Oh, my God.

1711
01:50:49,110 --> 01:50:53,023
 When I finally got to the hospital,
Michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed.

1712
01:50:53,110 --> 01:50:55,226
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?

1713
01:50:56,150 --> 01:50:58,459
I almost got into an accident
on the way here.

1714
01:50:58,550 --> 01:51:01,428
 And I told him I was partying all night.

1715
01:51:01,510 --> 01:51:03,307
 I'm fine.
 Come on. Get over here.

1716
01:51:03,390 --> 01:51:05,620
 Doc, I'm fine.
 Let me check you out.

1717
01:51:05,910 --> 01:51:07,025
Come on.

1718
01:51:09,910 --> 01:51:12,549
 He took mercy on me,
gave me 10 milligrams of Valium...

1719
01:51:12,630 --> 01:51:13,983
 and sent me home.

1720
01:51:14,390 --> 01:51:17,939
 My plan was to drop off my brother
at the house and pick up Karen.

1721
01:51:19,910 --> 01:51:22,947
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?

1722
01:51:23,030 --> 01:51:26,420
Right in front of us, there.
I think it's been following me all morning.

1723
01:51:26,510 --> 01:51:29,308
 Get the fuck out. What are you, nuts?
 I'm telling you.

1724
01:51:29,390 --> 01:51:30,618
I don't know what's going on.

1725
01:51:30,710 --> 01:51:33,702
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital I saw it.

1726
01:51:33,790 --> 01:51:36,145
I had to make some stops.
I've seen it every time.

1727
01:51:36,230 --> 01:51:38,983
I've been all over town
and I've seen it all day.

1728
01:51:45,270 --> 01:51:46,783
 I was cooking dinner that night.

1729
01:51:47,990 --> 01:51:51,778
 I had to start braising the beef
and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.

1730
01:51:53,950 --> 01:51:56,987
 It was Michael's favorite.
I was making ziti with meat gravy...

1731
01:51:57,070 --> 01:51:59,664
 and I'm planning to roast some peppers
over the flames...

1732
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:03,629
 put on some string beans with olive oil.
I had some beautiful cutlets...

1733
01:52:03,710 --> 01:52:04,779
 that were cut just right...

1734
01:52:04,870 --> 01:52:07,782
 that I was going to fry up as an appetizer.

1735
01:52:07,990 --> 01:52:09,981
 So, I was home for about an hour.

1736
01:52:10,070 --> 01:52:11,981
 My plan was to start the dinner early...

1737
01:52:12,070 --> 01:52:14,630
 so Karen and I could unload the guns
Jimmy didn't want...

1738
01:52:14,710 --> 01:52:16,109
 then get the package for Lois...

1739
01:52:16,190 --> 01:52:18,943
 to take to Atlanta for her trip
later that night.

1740
01:52:19,510 --> 01:52:23,298
 I kept looking out the window,
and I saw that the helicopter was gone.

1741
01:52:23,710 --> 01:52:27,464
Michael, keep an eye on the sauce.
Stay here with your Uncle Michael.

1742
01:52:28,150 --> 01:52:31,938
 So I asked my brother to watch the sauce,
and Karen and I started out.

1743
01:52:34,550 --> 01:52:36,541
Oh, God. I see it.

1744
01:52:36,790 --> 01:52:39,179
 I see it. Look, it's right there.
 Damn!

1745
01:52:40,350 --> 01:52:41,783
 That's it.
 There it is.

1746
01:52:41,870 --> 01:52:43,826
We got to get to your mother's.

1747
01:52:44,030 --> 01:52:45,349
See, I told you.

1748
01:52:45,430 --> 01:52:46,749
It's funny.

1749
01:52:47,150 --> 01:52:50,540
 It's not the end of the world.
 We're going to your mother's.

1750
01:53:17,150 --> 01:53:20,859
Go inside, tell your mother not to touch
anything outside the house. Nothing.

1751
01:53:20,950 --> 01:53:23,703
We couldn't go to your mother's house?
You had to come here.

1752
01:53:29,030 --> 01:53:30,668
Let's go shopping.

1753
01:53:32,670 --> 01:53:34,786
I'm not nuts,
it's been following me all morning.

1754
01:53:36,030 --> 01:53:37,349
I'm telling you.

1755
01:53:37,990 --> 01:53:41,107
Fine. Fine. He thinks I'm paranoid!

1756
01:53:42,150 --> 01:53:45,825
I should bring him the helicopter,
then we'll see how paranoid I am.

1757
01:53:47,350 --> 01:53:49,102
Come on, let's go inside.

1758
01:53:53,030 --> 01:53:54,827
 Yeah, it's gone.
 I don't hear anything.

1759
01:53:54,910 --> 01:53:56,263
Let's go back to your mother's.

1760
01:54:09,630 --> 01:54:12,098
 They all right?
 Beautiful. They're great.

1761
01:54:12,910 --> 01:54:15,504
Didn't I tell you, you were paranoid?
Didn't I tell him?

1762
01:54:15,590 --> 01:54:17,069
Yeah. I need a hit.

1763
01:54:17,590 --> 01:54:20,900
Want to see helicopters?
Come on, I'll show you helicopters.

1764
01:54:21,110 --> 01:54:24,022
I've seen enough helicopters for one day,
thank you.

1765
01:54:24,470 --> 01:54:28,668
 I had to get home and get the package
ready for Lois to take on her trip.

1766
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:32,584
 Also, I had to get to Sandy's to give
the package a whack with quinine.

1767
01:54:32,790 --> 01:54:35,020
 Plus, I knew Sandy would get on my ass.

1768
01:54:35,110 --> 01:54:38,739
 I had the cooking to finish,
and I had to get Lois ready for her trip.

1769
01:54:38,830 --> 01:54:41,742
 It's Sandy. What is this?
 She's a pain in the ass.

1770
01:54:42,950 --> 01:54:44,622
  When are you coming over?
 In an hour.

1771
01:54:44,710 --> 01:54:47,861
  You staying tonight, right?
 I can't. I got my brother tonight.

1772
01:54:47,950 --> 01:54:51,829
Come on, stop.
We'll talk about it later, okay? Goodbye.

1773
01:54:59,150 --> 01:55:01,061
  Hello?
 It's me. You ready?

1774
01:55:02,030 --> 01:55:05,227
Tell Michael not to let the sauce stick.
Keep stirring it.

1775
01:55:05,310 --> 01:55:09,064
 Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
 I'm stirring it.

1776
01:55:09,150 --> 01:55:10,981
  Listen, you know what to do?
 Yeah, yeah.

1777
01:55:11,070 --> 01:55:13,265
Don't "yeah, yeah" me, Lois.
This is important.

1778
01:55:13,350 --> 01:55:15,784
Make sure you leave the house
when you make the call.

1779
01:55:15,870 --> 01:55:18,987
Understand me?
Call from an outside line. I mean it.

1780
01:55:19,070 --> 01:55:22,665
Jesus, you must think I'm dumb. Why
are you bugging me? I know what to do.

1781
01:55:22,750 --> 01:55:25,344
You little hick, just make sure you do it.

1782
01:55:25,430 --> 01:55:26,465
 You can be such a pain.

1783
01:55:26,550 --> 01:55:30,304
  Hey! Just do it!
 Okay.

1784
01:55:31,030 --> 01:55:35,387
Un fucking believable. All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.

1785
01:55:36,670 --> 01:55:38,786
 What did he say?
 Nothing.

1786
01:55:38,870 --> 01:55:41,145
 What does she do
after she hangs up with me?

1787
01:55:41,230 --> 01:55:44,666
 After everything I told her?
After all her "yeah, yeah "bullshit?

1788
01:55:44,750 --> 01:55:47,344
 She picks up the phone
and calls from the house.

1789
01:55:47,430 --> 01:55:49,705
 If anybody was listening,
they'd know everything.

1790
01:55:49,790 --> 01:55:51,746
 They'd know a package
was leaving my house...

1791
01:55:51,830 --> 01:55:55,266
 and they'd even have the time and
flight number, thanks to her.

1792
01:55:56,830 --> 01:55:58,707
 As soon as I got home, I started cooking.

1793
01:55:58,790 --> 01:56:00,860
 I had a few hours until Lois' flight.

1794
01:56:00,950 --> 01:56:03,020
 I told my brother to watch the stove.

1795
01:56:03,110 --> 01:56:06,705
 All day long the guy's been watching
helicopters and tomato sauce.

1796
01:56:07,510 --> 01:56:11,947
 I had to drive over to Sandy's,
mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy.

1797
01:56:22,670 --> 01:56:25,662
Do you think you can come over here,
fuck me, and leave?

1798
01:56:25,750 --> 01:56:27,786
 Come on.
 You got someplace better to go?

1799
01:56:27,870 --> 01:56:30,304
Don't talk like that. Come on.

1800
01:56:30,670 --> 01:56:32,422
 You all right?
 Yeah, sure.

1801
01:56:32,510 --> 01:56:33,738
You believe me?

1802
01:56:34,870 --> 01:56:36,269
Do you believe me?

1803
01:56:36,510 --> 01:56:37,909
Do you believe me?

1804
01:56:39,790 --> 01:56:41,462
 That the last one?
 Yeah.

1805
01:56:50,670 --> 01:56:52,900
You lying son of a bitch. I hate you!

1806
01:56:59,350 --> 01:57:03,059
Please stop feeding the dog
from the table...

1807
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:05,380
from the plate on top of it. Stop it.

1808
01:57:05,470 --> 01:57:07,779
 I have to.
 You don't have to.

1809
01:57:12,510 --> 01:57:13,909
I got to go home.

1810
01:57:15,870 --> 01:57:17,781
What do you mean, you got to go home?

1811
01:57:17,870 --> 01:57:19,189
I've been carrying this all day.

1812
01:57:19,270 --> 01:57:21,864
We got to start taping it to your leg.
We got to go soon.

1813
01:57:21,950 --> 01:57:23,941
I got to go home and get my hat.

1814
01:57:24,670 --> 01:57:27,184
Forget your fucking hat.
Are you kidding me?

1815
01:57:27,350 --> 01:57:30,069
So I need a trip to Rockaway
because you want your hat?

1816
01:57:30,150 --> 01:57:33,984
I need it, I got to have it.
It's my lucky hat. I never fly without it.

1817
01:57:34,150 --> 01:57:37,984
Lois, do you understand
what we are involved in here?

1818
01:57:38,430 --> 01:57:41,342
I don't care. I need my hat.
I won't fly without it.

1819
01:57:46,070 --> 01:57:49,506
 What could I do if she insisted
I drive her home for her goddamn hat?

1820
01:57:49,590 --> 01:57:52,343
 I hid the package in the kitchen
and went to take her home.

1821
01:57:52,430 --> 01:57:53,499
A hat?

1822
01:58:02,230 --> 01:58:03,788
What the fuck is this?

1823
01:58:03,950 --> 01:58:06,464
Police! Freeze! Don't you move,
you motherfucker...

1824
01:58:06,550 --> 01:58:09,542
or I'll blow your brains out.
Shut the car off slowly.

1825
01:58:13,310 --> 01:58:15,301
 For a second, I thought I was dead.

1826
01:58:15,390 --> 01:58:17,858
 But when I heard all the noise,
I knew they were cops.

1827
01:58:17,950 --> 01:58:19,588
 Only cops talk that way.

1828
01:58:19,790 --> 01:58:20,939
Don't fucking move.

1829
01:58:21,030 --> 01:58:24,386
 If they had been wiseguys,
I wouldn't have heard a thing.

1830
01:58:25,230 --> 01:58:26,868
 I would have been dead.

1831
01:58:27,790 --> 01:58:29,428
Michael, lock the door!

1832
01:58:52,670 --> 01:58:55,548
Talk to me. When was the last time
you took a collar?

1833
01:58:55,630 --> 01:58:57,222
Fuckhead, I'm talking to you.

1834
01:58:57,310 --> 01:59:00,905
You don't want to say a fucking word,
don't. I don't really give a fuck.

1835
01:59:00,990 --> 01:59:05,029
You'll do 25 years. See how much
of a good guy you'll be then.

1836
01:59:05,110 --> 01:59:07,146
 All day I thought the guys
in the helicopter...

1837
01:59:07,230 --> 01:59:11,667
 were local cops busting my balls over
Lufthansa. They turned out to be narcs.

1838
01:59:11,750 --> 01:59:12,819
Just get the lawyer.

1839
01:59:12,910 --> 01:59:16,425
 They'd been on me a month.
Phone taps, surveillance, everything.

1840
01:59:16,510 --> 01:59:19,149
You know the boys. All the pals are here.

1841
01:59:19,230 --> 01:59:22,620
You don't want to talk to me,
you'll have a problem all night.

1842
01:59:22,830 --> 01:59:26,618
Each one of these counts holds
25 to life in New York State.

1843
01:59:26,710 --> 01:59:31,101
Twenty five fucking years, pal.
I'll slap your fucking head inside out.

1844
01:59:31,830 --> 01:59:34,025
What, were you guys grocery shopping?

1845
01:59:35,350 --> 01:59:39,025
Are we going to make a cake?
You going to make a fucking cake?

1846
01:59:39,270 --> 01:59:41,340
You got anything good in there?

1847
01:59:42,990 --> 01:59:44,105
Is it good?

1848
01:59:48,910 --> 01:59:50,389
Bye bye, dickhead.

1849
01:59:53,390 --> 01:59:54,789
See you in Attica, dick.

1850
01:59:55,350 --> 01:59:58,422
I spoke to Jimmy.
He offered to give me some money.

1851
01:59:58,870 --> 02:00:02,146
He just wants to know what's happening.
He just wants to talk to you.

1852
02:00:02,230 --> 02:00:03,663
Fuck Jimmy and his money.

1853
02:00:03,750 --> 02:00:06,981
I got to straighten out everything
with Paulie or I'm dead.

1854
02:00:07,590 --> 02:00:09,342
Then you're better off staying in here.

1855
02:00:09,430 --> 02:00:12,900
They could whack me in here as easy
as outside, maybe even easier.

1856
02:00:12,990 --> 02:00:14,662
They're afraid I'll rat them out.

1857
02:00:14,750 --> 02:00:18,902
People are already walking away from me.
I'm dead in here. You got to get me out.

1858
02:00:18,990 --> 02:00:23,461
 Karen finally got her mother to put
her house up for my bail and I was out.

1859
02:00:23,550 --> 02:00:27,509
 I remember I had this feeling
I would be killed right outside the jail.

1860
02:00:27,910 --> 02:00:31,027
 I knew Paulie was still pissed at me,
and he's such a hothead.

1861
02:00:31,110 --> 02:00:32,862
 And I was worried about Jimmy.

1862
02:00:32,950 --> 02:00:37,068
 See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out
he was into drug deals with me...

1863
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:40,662
 Paulie would have Jimmy whacked
even before me.

1864
02:00:42,310 --> 02:00:43,868
 This is the bad time.

1865
02:00:44,710 --> 02:00:46,860
 I didn't feel safe until I got home.

1866
02:00:48,630 --> 02:00:52,305
 Now my plan was to stay alive
long enough to sell off the dope...

1867
02:00:52,390 --> 02:00:56,781
 the cops never found, then disappear
until I can get things straightened out.

1868
02:00:58,310 --> 02:00:59,379
Fuck!

1869
02:00:59,470 --> 02:01:03,065
 Where's the stuff I left, Karen?
 I flushed it down the toilet.

1870
02:01:04,750 --> 02:01:05,785
You what?

1871
02:01:06,230 --> 02:01:08,790
What was I supposed to do?
They were all over the house.

1872
02:01:08,870 --> 02:01:12,863
That was worth $60,000!
I need that money! That's all we got!

1873
02:01:12,950 --> 02:01:15,589
What was I supposed to do?
They had a search warrant!

1874
02:01:15,670 --> 02:01:19,948
That's all the money we had! I was
depending on that! Why did you do that?

1875
02:01:20,430 --> 02:01:23,183
I had to. They were going to find it!

1876
02:01:23,270 --> 02:01:27,104
 They would have never found it!
 They would have, I swear to you!

1877
02:01:28,470 --> 02:01:30,062
They would've found it!

1878
02:01:31,470 --> 02:01:32,903
Why did you do that?

1879
02:01:32,990 --> 02:01:36,426
 They would have found it.
 Why did you do that, Karen?

1880
02:01:37,590 --> 02:01:39,467
Oh, my God!

1881
02:01:39,910 --> 02:01:42,708
 I had to do it.
 Oh, my God.

1882
02:02:17,390 --> 02:02:19,221
 Paulie, I'm really sorry.

1883
02:02:21,790 --> 02:02:24,509
I don't know what else to say.
I know I fucked up.

1884
02:02:24,590 --> 02:02:26,182
Yeah, you fucked up.

1885
02:02:29,710 --> 02:02:31,541
But I'm all right now.

1886
02:02:33,070 --> 02:02:37,302
I can be trusted now. I'm clean.
On my kids, I'm clean.

1887
02:02:37,390 --> 02:02:39,620
You looked in my eyes and lied to me.

1888
02:02:40,750 --> 02:02:42,820
You treated me like a fucking jerk.

1889
02:02:43,390 --> 02:02:44,903
Like I was never nothing to you.

1890
02:02:44,990 --> 02:02:47,743
After what you said,
I couldn't come to you.

1891
02:02:48,830 --> 02:02:51,105
You know, I was ashamed.

1892
02:02:54,030 --> 02:02:55,907
I'm ashamed now.

1893
02:02:59,110 --> 02:03:01,340
But I got nowhere else to go, Paulie.

1894
02:03:04,270 --> 02:03:08,422
You're all I've got.
And I really need your help. I really do.

1895
02:03:14,350 --> 02:03:15,385
Take this.

1896
02:03:29,830 --> 02:03:32,219
And now I've got to turn my back on you.

1897
02:03:41,830 --> 02:03:43,422
 $3,200.

1898
02:03:43,990 --> 02:03:47,824
 That's what he gave me.
$3,200 for a lifetime.

1899
02:03:48,710 --> 02:03:50,940
 It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.

1900
02:03:51,030 --> 02:03:53,021
  We got to get out.
 I don't want to run.

1901
02:03:53,110 --> 02:03:57,342
I don't want to. Am I supposed to pick up
and leave everything? Go hiding?

1902
02:03:57,750 --> 02:04:00,218
I don't want to do that.
Is that what you want?

1903
02:04:00,310 --> 02:04:02,380
If we stay around here, we're dead.

1904
02:04:03,110 --> 02:04:04,862
You got it? We're dead.

1905
02:04:05,510 --> 02:04:06,704
They're right.

1906
02:04:07,030 --> 02:04:10,147
You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.

1907
02:04:13,230 --> 02:04:15,107
How's he doing? Busting his balls or what?

1908
02:04:15,190 --> 02:04:16,259
He's okay.

1909
02:04:17,350 --> 02:04:18,829
They sobered him up.

1910
02:04:19,030 --> 02:04:21,100
Good. Very good. Glad to hear it.

1911
02:04:24,750 --> 02:04:27,105
You know what kind of questions
they're asking him?

1912
02:04:27,190 --> 02:04:28,748
Jimmy, I don't know.

1913
02:04:29,790 --> 02:04:33,180
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money....

1914
02:04:33,710 --> 02:04:36,270
The girls are old enough
to read the newspapers.

1915
02:04:36,350 --> 02:04:38,466
Tell him he's got to call me. Okay?

1916
02:04:39,150 --> 02:04:42,620
As soon as you talk to him,
he's got to call me. It's important.

1917
02:04:42,950 --> 02:04:46,465
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.

1918
02:04:46,550 --> 02:04:49,587
 Take this. It's a couple of thousands.
 Thanks, Jimmy.

1919
02:04:49,750 --> 02:04:51,661
Don't worry, everything will be all right.

1920
02:04:51,750 --> 02:04:54,947
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?

1921
02:04:55,190 --> 02:04:56,987
Pick out a few for yourself.

1922
02:04:57,750 --> 02:04:59,581
 For my mom.
 Yeah, whatever.

1923
02:04:59,750 --> 02:05:02,389
No. It's over here.
In the store on the corner.

1924
02:05:02,470 --> 02:05:04,938
It's swag, so I got it down on the corner.

1925
02:05:10,510 --> 02:05:12,307
Go ahead, sweetheart, I'll see you.

1926
02:05:12,390 --> 02:05:14,142
 Thanks, Jimmy.
 Don't worry.

1927
02:05:14,230 --> 02:05:16,824
 I'll try.
 Don't forget, he's got to call me.

1928
02:05:19,230 --> 02:05:21,346
 Over here?
 Right down there.

1929
02:05:35,750 --> 02:05:37,706
It's over there, on the corner.

1930
02:05:37,990 --> 02:05:39,218
Right there.

1931
02:06:12,030 --> 02:06:14,146
No, go ahead. It's right in there.

1932
02:06:14,230 --> 02:06:16,221
No, Jimmy. I'm in a hurry!

1933
02:06:16,550 --> 02:06:19,303
My mom's watching the kids!
I got to get home!

1934
02:06:19,390 --> 02:06:20,869
I'll come back later!

1935
02:06:42,390 --> 02:06:43,948
Karen!

1936
02:06:48,270 --> 02:06:49,464
What happened?

1937
02:06:50,630 --> 02:06:51,699
Nothing.

1938
02:06:52,190 --> 02:06:54,260
 What happened?
 I just got scared.

1939
02:06:57,350 --> 02:06:58,544
Got the keys?

1940
02:07:00,150 --> 02:07:03,699
 What happened, Karen?
 I just got scared. It's okay.

1941
02:07:03,790 --> 02:07:05,462
 Are you all right?
 Yeah.

1942
02:07:11,950 --> 02:07:16,341
 If you're part of a crew, nobody ever
tells you they're going to kill you.

1943
02:07:16,870 --> 02:07:18,622
 It doesn't happen that way.

1944
02:07:18,710 --> 02:07:22,066
 There aren't any arguments
or curses like in the movies.

1945
02:07:22,150 --> 02:07:26,143
 Your murderers come with smiles.
They come as your friends.

1946
02:07:26,230 --> 02:07:28,221
 People who cared for you all your life.

1947
02:07:28,310 --> 02:07:32,542
 They always seem to come when you're
weakest and most in need of their help.

1948
02:07:32,870 --> 02:07:35,987
 So I met Jimmy in a crowded place
we both knew.

1949
02:07:36,350 --> 02:07:40,184
 I got there 15 minutes early,
and Jimmy was already there.

1950
02:07:40,590 --> 02:07:44,822
 He took the booth near the window
so he could see everyone who drove up.

1951
02:07:45,150 --> 02:07:47,425
 He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.

1952
02:07:47,830 --> 02:07:50,583
 He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing.

1953
02:07:51,590 --> 02:07:54,548
 On the surface,
everything was supposed to be fine.

1954
02:07:54,630 --> 02:07:56,939
 We were supposed to be discussing
my case.

1955
02:07:57,030 --> 02:08:01,785
 But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying
to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.

1956
02:08:03,390 --> 02:08:06,939
I been telling you your whole life,
don't talk on the phone.

1957
02:08:07,150 --> 02:08:08,868
Now you understand?

1958
02:08:11,430 --> 02:08:14,820
It's going to be okay.
You got a good chance to beat the case.

1959
02:08:17,670 --> 02:08:21,743
You know that kid from the city
we were talking about? You know?

1960
02:08:24,070 --> 02:08:28,427
The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon as
he got pinched, he ratted on everybody.

1961
02:08:30,790 --> 02:08:32,940
I know where he is. He's hiding now.

1962
02:08:34,470 --> 02:08:35,983
Know what I'm saying?

1963
02:08:40,550 --> 02:08:44,065
Would you have a problem going
with Anthony to take care of that?

1964
02:08:46,550 --> 02:08:47,744
No, not at all.

1965
02:08:49,310 --> 02:08:51,028
That way they got nothing.

1966
02:08:59,310 --> 02:09:02,108
 Jimmy had never asked me
to whack somebody before.

1967
02:09:02,390 --> 02:09:05,985
 But now he's asking me to go to Florida
and do a hit with Anthony.

1968
02:09:13,150 --> 02:09:16,779
 That's when I knew I would never
have come back from Florida alive.

1969
02:09:30,150 --> 02:09:33,347
Whenever you move me,
I asked once and I'll tell you again...

1970
02:09:33,430 --> 02:09:35,500
I don't want to go any place cold.

1971
02:09:36,190 --> 02:09:38,499
You don't have a choice in that matter.

1972
02:09:38,630 --> 02:09:41,064
Come on. Whoever fucking controls it...

1973
02:09:41,830 --> 02:09:44,424
just no place cold. Do that for me.
I'm trying to

1974
02:09:44,510 --> 02:09:46,262
He's bronchial, that's why.

1975
02:09:46,350 --> 02:09:48,864
If he's legitimately bronchial,
we'll consider that.

1976
02:09:48,950 --> 02:09:51,145
I'd like to go someplace not cold.

1977
02:09:51,230 --> 02:09:54,825
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?

1978
02:09:55,790 --> 02:09:56,905
What about them?

1979
02:09:56,990 --> 02:09:59,868
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?

1980
02:10:00,590 --> 02:10:03,104
Don't I have some kind of contact
with them?

1981
02:10:03,550 --> 02:10:04,585
No.

1982
02:10:05,630 --> 02:10:08,827
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me that...

1983
02:10:09,190 --> 02:10:13,103
God forbid something happens to my
parents, they get sick, I can't see them?

1984
02:10:13,190 --> 02:10:16,068
Maybe something can be worked out
if they're sick...

1985
02:10:16,550 --> 02:10:18,666
if there's extraordinary circumstances

1986
02:10:18,750 --> 02:10:21,503
I can't do this. I can't do this, Henry.

1987
02:10:22,590 --> 02:10:24,262
I can't leave my parents.

1988
02:10:25,470 --> 02:10:27,586
Excuse me, Karen, I told you before.

1989
02:10:28,790 --> 02:10:32,180
I'm not going to do this
unless you and the kids come with me.

1990
02:10:33,910 --> 02:10:35,628
I can't do it without you.

1991
02:10:35,910 --> 02:10:39,823
So, you do whatever, but...that's it.

1992
02:10:41,310 --> 02:10:43,904
 You need Henry, not me, right?
 That's right.

1993
02:10:44,070 --> 02:10:46,584
Frankly, I don't care
whether you go or not.

1994
02:10:46,710 --> 02:10:49,907
If it'll make him a better witness,
I'd like you to be with him.

1995
02:10:49,990 --> 02:10:51,708
They want Henry, not me.

1996
02:10:51,790 --> 02:10:55,146
Henry'll be in the protection program.
They can't get to him.

1997
02:10:55,630 --> 02:10:58,986
They can only get to him
by getting to you or your kids.

1998
02:10:59,070 --> 02:11:01,459
If he goes into the program,
you're in danger

1999
02:11:01,550 --> 02:11:03,939
 I don't know anything.
 Don't give me...

2000
02:11:04,030 --> 02:11:05,429
the babe in the woods routine.

2001
02:11:05,510 --> 02:11:09,981
I've listened to those wiretaps,
and I've heard you talk about cocaine.

2002
02:11:10,070 --> 02:11:13,585
 Conversation after conversation
you talked to Henry on the phone.

2003
02:11:18,190 --> 02:11:20,226
It doesn't matter.
Whether he goes to jail...

2004
02:11:20,310 --> 02:11:23,620
or stays on the streets and beats the case,
he's a dead man.

2005
02:11:24,190 --> 02:11:26,021
He knows it and you know it.

2006
02:11:27,430 --> 02:11:29,102
What about the kids and school?

2007
02:11:29,190 --> 02:11:31,624
 Will they get left back?
I mean, what goes on?

2008
02:11:31,710 --> 02:11:34,065
Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.

2009
02:11:34,190 --> 02:11:36,545
Whoever sold you those suits
had a sense of humor.

2010
02:11:36,750 --> 02:11:39,662
What it comes down to is
we're your only salvation.

2011
02:11:40,470 --> 02:11:44,065
We'll save your life and his life,
and we'll keep you out of jail.

2012
02:11:47,830 --> 02:11:50,424
 This morning you told the jury
about your background.

2013
02:11:50,510 --> 02:11:52,501
 It was easy for us to disappear.

2014
02:11:52,790 --> 02:11:54,906
 My house
was in my mother in law's name.

2015
02:11:54,990 --> 02:11:56,946
 My cars were registered to my wife.

2016
02:11:57,030 --> 02:12:00,386
 My Social Security cards
and driver's licenses were phonies.

2017
02:12:00,510 --> 02:12:02,740
 I never voted or paid taxes.

2018
02:12:03,310 --> 02:12:07,667
 My birth certificate and arrest sheet was
all you'd ever have to know I was alive.

2019
02:12:07,750 --> 02:12:10,310
 Do you see him here in this courtroom?
 Yes.

2020
02:12:10,590 --> 02:12:13,104
Will you please point him out for the jury?

2021
02:12:15,390 --> 02:12:19,827
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, James Conway.

2022
02:12:20,910 --> 02:12:23,868
Do you also know a man
named Paul Cicero?

2023
02:12:24,190 --> 02:12:26,465
 Do you see him in the courtroom?
 Yes.

2024
02:12:26,670 --> 02:12:28,786
Can you point him out for the jury?

2025
02:12:30,390 --> 02:12:34,429
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, Paul Cicero.

2026
02:12:35,590 --> 02:12:37,308
Your Honor, I have a document....

2027
02:12:37,390 --> 02:12:39,699
 The hardest thing was leaving the life.

2028
02:12:40,430 --> 02:12:41,988
 I still love the life.

2029
02:12:42,270 --> 02:12:44,340
 We were treated like movie stars
with muscle.

2030
02:12:44,430 --> 02:12:46,500
 We had it all, just for the asking.

2031
02:12:46,590 --> 02:12:49,787
 Our wives, mothers, kids,
everybody rode along.

2032
02:12:50,110 --> 02:12:53,182
 I had paper bags filled with jewelry
stashed in the kitchen.

2033
02:12:53,270 --> 02:12:55,545
 I had a sugar bowl full of coke
next to the bed.

2034
02:12:55,630 --> 02:12:59,339
People call them rats because rats do
anything to survive. Isn't that right?

2035
02:12:59,430 --> 02:13:01,466
 Objection!
 Objection sustained.

2036
02:13:01,550 --> 02:13:04,587
 I know nothing about being a rat.
 You know everything about it.

2037
02:13:05,390 --> 02:13:06,903
Objection, Your Honor.
In view of the violence....

2038
02:13:06,990 --> 02:13:09,185
 Anything I wanted was a phone call away.

2039
02:13:09,270 --> 02:13:12,660
 Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideout flats
all over the city.

2040
02:13:12,750 --> 02:13:15,218
 I'd bet $20,000, $30,000 over a weekend...

2041
02:13:15,310 --> 02:13:19,303
 then blow the winnings in a week
or go to the sharks to pay the bookies.

2042
02:13:19,470 --> 02:13:20,823
It didn't matter.

2043
02:13:21,150 --> 02:13:25,826
It didn't mean anything. When I was broke
I would go out and rob some more.

2044
02:13:26,230 --> 02:13:27,629
We ran everything.

2045
02:13:28,070 --> 02:13:32,188
We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.

2046
02:13:32,430 --> 02:13:35,786
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.

2047
02:13:37,750 --> 02:13:39,308
And now it's all over.

2048
02:13:40,070 --> 02:13:41,708
 That's the hardest part.

2049
02:13:42,430 --> 02:13:44,022
 Today everything is different.

2050
02:13:44,110 --> 02:13:48,149
 There's no action.
I have to wait around like everyone else.

2051
02:13:48,510 --> 02:13:50,228
 Can't even get decent food.

2052
02:13:50,950 --> 02:13:54,022
 After I got here I ordered spaghetti
with marinara sauce...

2053
02:13:54,110 --> 02:13:56,180
 and I got egg noodles and ketchup.

2054
02:13:56,670 --> 02:13:58,228
 I'm an average nobody.

2055
02:13:59,430 --> 02:14:02,183
 I get to live the rest of my life
like a schnook.

2056
02:14:46,270 --> 02:14:54,170
Thanks for using the subs
    regards, shock...
