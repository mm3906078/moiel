32
00:05:16,674 --> 00:05:19,647
Let's get together, please.

33
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,428
Smile. Good.

34
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,981
Yes, sir.

35
00:05:54,078 --> 00:05:57,531
Bring them over
a round of drinks.

36
00:05:57,626 --> 00:06:02,806
Very good, sir.
And who shall I say
th-they are from?

37
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:05,779
You can say they are from me.

38
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:28,892
From the gentleman. Where?

39
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:36,755
Do you know him?

40
00:06:36,756 --> 00:06:39,153
Find out who he is.

41
00:06:39,154 --> 00:06:40,975
Yes, sir.

42
00:06:43,758 --> 00:06:46,059
Agnieszka, I would
give anything...

43
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,168
to hear you sing tonight.

44
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:50,471
But I know you won't.

45
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:54,595
You embarrass me.

46
00:07:02,747 --> 00:07:04,761
What's he doing?

47
00:07:07,063 --> 00:07:08,980
Stay here.

48
00:07:12,338 --> 00:07:14,254
How are you doing?

49
00:07:14,255 --> 00:07:18,379
You'd leave a woman
alone at the table
in a place like this?

50
00:07:18,475 --> 00:07:21,256
Sweetheart,
you're the picture
of loneliness.

51
00:07:21,257 --> 00:07:23,175
Oh.

52
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,531
Mmm, what a lovely
fragrance. You are
breaking my heart.

53
00:07:26,628 --> 00:07:29,121
An extra chair, please.
Vodka for my friend.

54
00:07:29,217 --> 00:07:31,615
And for the lady? Pernod.

55
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:35,451

66
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:12,950
Thank you.
I'll tell you what
I mean by cooperative.

67
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:16,306
Two days after the law
is passed that allJews
have to wear the star,

68
00:08:16,307 --> 00:08:18,417
theJewish tailors
are turning them out
by the gross...

69
00:08:18,513 --> 00:08:20,814
in a variety of fabrics
at three zloty each.

70
00:08:20,911 --> 00:08:22,733
Tell me about
your cellar wines.

71
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:26,186
I have an excellent
German Riesling. 1937.
Mmm, French.

72
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:28,870
A Bordeaux.
Chateau Latour, '28, '29?
No, I'm sorry.

73
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,269
It's as if they have no idea
what kind of law it is.

74
00:08:31,364 --> 00:08:34,242
As if it's the emblem
of a riding club.

75
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:36,352
A Margaux, '29?
No, no,
we don't have that.

76
00:08:36,447 --> 00:08:38,653
Burgundy then?
A Romanee-Conti, '37?
Yes.

77
00:08:38,749 --> 00:08:41,530
It's human nature.
"We'll do this to avoid that."

78
00:08:41,627 --> 00:08:43,736
That's what they have done
since thousands of years.

79
00:08:43,737 --> 00:08:45,943
It's what they do.
They weather the storm.

80
00:08:46,038 --> 00:08:49,875
But this storm is different.
This is not the Romans.
This storm is the SS.

89
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:21,620
Martin?

90
00:09:21,715 --> 00:09:23,729
Yes, sir.

91
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,646
Who is that man?

92
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:29,771
That-- That's Oskar Schindler!

93

97
00:09:42,527 --> 00:09:45,500

100
00:10:21,177 --> 00:10:23,095
An alleJuden!

101
00:10:23,096 --> 00:10:26,836
Ab sofort ist es allen Juden
untersagt...

102
00:10:26,931 --> 00:10:30,863
Fleisch aufkoscher Art
zuzubereiten.

103
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,125
Meldung an alleJuden.
Ab sofort--

104
00:10:52,922 --> 00:10:54,841
Rabbi--
Private property
cannot be confiscated.

105
00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:56,759
How long are the schools
going to be closed?
I do not know.

106
00:10:56,854 --> 00:11:00,018
Pillage
is formally prohibited.
You don't know anything!

107
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:01,937
I am familiar with
the Hague Convention.
Religious--

108
00:11:01,938 --> 00:11:06,061
They come into our house
and tell us we don't
live there anymore.

109
00:11:06,158 --> 00:11:08,938
It now belongs
to a certain SS officer.

110
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:11,048
Please. I only know
what they tell me.

111
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:14,214
And what they tell me
changes from day to day.

112
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:17,283
Aren't you supposed
to be able to help?

113
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:20,350
I mean, what if I just
took this thing off?

114
00:11:20,351 --> 00:11:23,037
What are they going
to do about it?
They will shoot you.

115
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:27,065
Why don't you stop
this silly talk?
Itzhak Stern!

116
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:30,230
I'm looking for Itzhak Stern.

117
00:11:31,956 --> 00:11:34,832
Are you Itzhak Stern or not?

118
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,806
I am. Where can we talk?

119
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:50,849
There's a company
you did the books for
on Lipowa Street.

120
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,246
Made what? Pots and pans?

121
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:56,220
By law, I have to tell you,
sir, I'm a Jew.

122
00:11:56,317 --> 00:12:00,057
Well, I'm a German.
So there we are.

123
00:12:02,743 --> 00:12:06,291
A good company,
you think?
Modestly successful.

124
00:12:06,387 --> 00:12:08,880
I know nothing
about enamelware.
Do you?

125
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:11,278
I was just the accountant.

126
00:12:11,374 --> 00:12:13,676
Simple engineering though,
wouldn't you think?

127
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:15,018
Change the machines around,
whatever you do,

128
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:17,415
you could make other
things, couldn't you?

129
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:21,828
Field kits, mess kits.
Army contracts.

130
00:12:23,554 --> 00:12:26,335
Once the war ends,
forget it, but for now
it's great.

131
00:12:26,432 --> 00:12:28,540
You can make a fortune,
don't you think?

132
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,802
I think most people right now
have other priorities.

133
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:34,679
Like what?

134
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:37,077
I'm sure you'll do just fine
once you get the contracts.

135
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:39,187
In fact, the worse things get,
the better you'll do.

136
00:12:39,188 --> 00:12:42,544
Oh, well, I can get
the signatures I need.
That's the easy part.

137
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,188
Finding the money
to buy the company,
that's hard.

138
00:12:46,284 --> 00:12:48,106
You don't have any money?

139
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:52,134
Not that kind of money.
You know anybody?

140
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,012
Jews, yeah.

141
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,888
Investors. You must
have contacts...

142
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,807
in theJewish
business community
working here.

143
00:12:59,903 --> 00:13:02,587
What community?
Jews can no longer
own businesses.

144
00:13:02,588 --> 00:13:05,562
That's why this one's
in receivership.
But they

145
00:13:05,657 --> 00:13:08,342
I'd own it.
I'd pay them back in
product-- pots and pans.

146
00:13:08,343 --> 00:13:11,218
Pots and pans.
Something
they can use.

147
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:13,136
Something they can
feel in their hands.

148
00:13:13,137 --> 00:13:15,343
They can trade it
on the black market,
do whatever they want.

149
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,742
Everybody's happy.

150
00:13:19,276 --> 00:13:22,057
If you want, you could
run the company for me.

151
00:13:25,798 --> 00:13:28,100
Let me understand.

152
00:13:28,195 --> 00:13:30,880
They'd put up all the money,
I'd do all the work.

153
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:34,045
What, if you don't mind
my asking, would you do?

154
00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:36,443
I'd make sure it's known
the company's in business.

155
00:13:36,444 --> 00:13:38,648
I'd see that it had
a certain panache.

156
00:13:38,745 --> 00:13:42,389
That's what I'm good at,
not the work. Not the work.

157
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,787
The presentation.

158
00:14:02,147 --> 00:14:06,269
I'm sure I don't know anybody
who'll be interested in this.

159
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,490
Well, they should be,
Itzhak Stern.

160
00:14:10,586 --> 00:14:14,230
Tell them they should be.

161
00:14:23,053 --> 00:14:25,739
Achtung! Achtung!

162
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:31,493
An alleJuden...
Ab sofort ist es verboten--

163
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:36,000
Vere dignum et justum est,
aequum et salutare,

164
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:40,316
nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere,

165
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:43,578
Domine Sancte, Pater Omnipotens,
Aeterne Deus.

166
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:47,031
I've got a client
who'll sell marks
for zloty at 2.45 to 1.

167
00:14:47,126 --> 00:14:49,332
Wool, mink collar.
It's a nice coat.

168
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,250
She'll trade it
for ration coupons.

169
00:14:51,251 --> 00:14:54,605
Wicks, for lamps.
You have a truckload
of wicks?

170
00:14:54,606 --> 00:14:58,635
What am I going to do
with a truckload of wicks?
Nine by 12, nine by 14.

171
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,608
I don't know.
Big, beautiful, Persian.

172
00:15:01,704 --> 00:15:04,485
Lumen aeternum mundo effudit--

173
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:06,883
Psst. What?

174
00:15:06,979 --> 00:15:08,801
You don't recognize this?
It's shoe polish.

175
00:15:08,897 --> 00:15:11,199
In metal containers?
You asked
for shoe polish.

176
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:13,499
In metal containers.
This is glass.
In metal containers.

177
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,417
It's not what I asked for.
What's
the difference?

178
00:15:15,418 --> 00:15:17,336
What's the difference?
What's the difference?

179
00:15:17,337 --> 00:15:19,351
Shh.! My client sold it

180
00:15:19,446 --> 00:15:21,269
who sold it to the German Army.

181
00:15:21,461 --> 00:15:25,584
Only by the time it got there,
because of the freezing cold,
it broke. All 10,000 units.

182
00:15:25,585 --> 00:15:27,791
Mmm,
ooh, ooh, ooh.
This is not my problem.

183
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,804
This is not
his problem.
This is not your problem?

184
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:32,298
This is not
my problem.
All right.

185
00:15:32,394 --> 00:15:36,134
The German Army
wants to find out
where it came from.

186
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,491
I am going to make sure
they find out.
Now it's your problem.

187
00:15:39,492 --> 00:15:42,560
You be quiet!

188
00:15:42,656 --> 00:15:45,246
Metal containers.

189
00:15:45,342 --> 00:15:48,026
Hello.

190
00:15:48,027 --> 00:15:51,958
Pardon me for interfering,
but that's a nice shirt.

191
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,260
Nice shirt.

192
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:57,425
Do you know where
I can find a nice
shirt like that?

193
00:15:59,344 --> 00:16:03,180
...laudare, benedicere
et predicare.

194
00:16:04,906 --> 00:16:06,729
Like this?

195
00:16:06,824 --> 00:16:09,702
It's illegal to buy or sell
anything on the street.

196
00:16:09,797 --> 00:16:12,963
We don't do that.
We're here to pray.

197
00:16:14,977 --> 00:16:17,566
Jesum Christum Dominum Nostrum--

198
00:16:17,662 --> 00:16:22,361
Do you have any idea how much
a shirt like this costs?
Nice things cost money.

199
00:16:22,362 --> 00:16:26,486
...adorant Dominationes,
tremunt Potestates.

200
00:16:26,581 --> 00:16:31,761
Coeli coelorumque
virtutes ac Beata Seraphim...

201
00:16:31,856 --> 00:16:34,925
socia exultatione
concelebrant--

202
00:16:35,021 --> 00:16:37,323
How many?

203
00:16:37,418 --> 00:16:41,160
I'm going to need
some other things, too,
as things come up.

204
00:16:41,255 --> 00:16:45,283
This won't be
a problem.
From time to time.

205
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,256
Achtung! Achtung!

206
00:17:28,249 --> 00:17:31,509
- Name? Adresse?
- Formular ausfuellen!

207
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,908
Wetter, wetter.!
Nicht draengeln.!

208
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:36,497
Kommen Sie hierher.!
Stellen Sie sich doch an.!

209
00:18:21,765 --> 00:18:24,929
Achtung, achtung!
AlleJuden sind verpflichtet...

210
00:18:25,026 --> 00:18:28,574
im abgesonderten
juedischen Bezirk zu wohnen.

211
00:18:28,671 --> 00:18:32,603
Nichteinhaltung der Meldepflicht
bei der Einwohnerbehoerde...

212
00:18:32,698 --> 00:18:35,479
verstoesst gegen das Edikt 44I91
und fuehrt zur Anzeige...

213
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:37,110
beim Militaergericht.

214
00:18:39,124 --> 00:18:42,769
This is obviously the right
place. How are you doing?
Herr Schindler.

215
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:50,825
Good-bye, Jews.!
Good-bye, Jews.!

216
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,757
Good-bye, Jews! Good-bye, Jews!

217
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,880
Good-bye, Jews.!

218
00:18:58,881 --> 00:19:03,484
Good-bye, Jews.!
Good-bye, Jews.!

219
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,333
This iz the vechteka,
Moyshe.
Ojciec.

220
00:19:09,334 --> 00:19:12,307
Nyne, this kan neash zyane.

221
00:19:21,898 --> 00:19:25,543
Oh, my God.

222
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:28,899
Oy, God. Oh, my God.

223
00:19:35,517 --> 00:19:38,203
Oh, my God.

224
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,067
It could not be better.

225
00:19:46,162 --> 00:19:49,712
It could be worse.
How? Tell me.

226
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:52,588
How on earth could it
possibly be worse?

227
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:57,191
Dzien dobry.

228
00:19:57,192 --> 00:19:59,493
Dzien dobry. Dzien dobry.

229
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,315
Dzien dobry.

230
00:20:01,316 --> 00:20:03,713
Dzien dobry. Dzien dobry.

231
00:20:06,591 --> 00:20:08,892
Hey, Goldberg. Poldek.

232
00:20:08,989 --> 00:20:13,113
What's this?
Uh, the Judenrat has
its own police now.

233
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:15,894
You don't say. Ordnungsdienst.

234
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,387
I'm a policeman now,
could you believe it?
It's hard to believe.

235
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,399
Oh, no,
it's not hard
to believe.

236
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,800
It's a good racket, Poldek.
The only racket here.

237
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:26,155
Look, maybe I could
put in a good word for you
with my superiors.

238
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:30,280
Your superiors?
Come on, they are not
as bad as everyone says.

239
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:33,445
Well, they're worse
than everyone says,
but it's a lot of money.

240
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,034
A lot of money.

241
00:20:36,131 --> 00:20:38,720
Give me my housing assignment.

242
00:20:38,815 --> 00:20:43,036
Come on.
You look funny
in that hat, Goldberg.

243
00:20:43,131 --> 00:20:46,392
You look like a clown,
you know?

244
00:20:51,187 --> 00:20:53,488
He's a very important man.

245
00:20:53,489 --> 00:20:55,215
Just give him
two minutes of your time.

246
00:20:55,312 --> 00:20:58,572
Since when did time cost money?
Just sit down and listen.

247
00:20:58,668 --> 00:21:00,778
Please. Sir?

248
00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:06,341
For each thousand you invest,
I will repay you with...

249
00:21:06,342 --> 00:21:08,451
Two hundred.
200 kilos
of enamelware a month,

250
00:21:08,546 --> 00:21:10,368
to begin in July
and to continue
for one year.

251
00:21:10,465 --> 00:21:14,109
After which time, we're even.
That's it. It's very simple.

252
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,985
Not good enough.
It's not
good enough.

253
00:21:16,986 --> 00:21:19,193
Not good enough?

254
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:23,220
Look where you're living.
Look where you've been put.
"Not good enough."

255
00:21:23,317 --> 00:21:25,714
A couple of months ago you'd
be right, not anymore.

256
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:28,782
Money's still money.

257
00:21:30,317 --> 00:21:32,523
No, it is not.

258
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:34,537
That's why we're here.

259
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:36,549
Trade goods--
that's the only currency...

260
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,469
that'll be worth
anything in the ghetto.

261
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:41,731
Things have changed, my friend.

262
00:21:42,498 --> 00:21:44,799
Did I call this meeting?

263
00:21:44,895 --> 00:21:47,196
You told Mr. Stern
you wanted to speak to me.

264
00:21:47,293 --> 00:21:49,786
I'm here.
I've made you a fair offer.

265
00:21:49,787 --> 00:21:53,622
Fair would be
a percentage in the company.

266
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:56,787
Forget the whole thing.

267
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:59,089
Get out.

268
00:22:03,118 --> 00:22:06,089
How do we know that you
will do what you say?

269
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,008
Because I said I would.

270
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:10,214
You want a contract?
To be upheld by what court?

271
00:22:10,215 --> 00:22:13,091
I said what I'll do.
That's our contract.

272
00:22:16,352 --> 00:22:18,462
...mielismy racje.

273
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:34,862
Piec, szesc, siedem...

274
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:38,411
osiem, dziewiec.

275
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,563
The standard SS rate for
Jewish skilled labor
is seven marks a day,

276
00:22:53,564 --> 00:22:56,441
five for unskilled and women.

277
00:22:56,538 --> 00:22:59,414
This is what you pay
the Reich Economic Office.

278
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,908
TheJews themselves
receive nothing.

279
00:23:02,003 --> 00:23:06,224
Poles you pay wages.
Generally, they get
a little more.

280
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,813
Are you
listening?
What was that about the SS?

281
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:11,020
The rate? The what?

282
00:23:11,115 --> 00:23:14,568
TheJewish worker's salary--
you pay it directly to
the SS, not to the worker.

283
00:23:14,663 --> 00:23:16,676
He gets nothing. But it's less.

284
00:23:16,677 --> 00:23:18,692
It's less than what
I would pay a Pole.
It's less.

285
00:23:18,787 --> 00:23:21,568
That's the point
I'm trying to make.

286
00:23:21,665 --> 00:23:24,159
Poles cost more.

287
00:23:24,254 --> 00:23:28,666
Why should I hire Poles?

288
00:23:28,762 --> 00:23:32,502
An enamelware factory
over at, uh, Lipowa Street.

289
00:23:32,598 --> 00:23:35,379
It, uh, it, um--
It's owned by a German.

290
00:23:35,475 --> 00:23:38,448
But it's outside
the ghetto, so you can
barter for extra goods--

291
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:40,654
for eggs, I don't know
what you need--

292
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,764
with the Polish workers.
You can't get it here.

293
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:46,888
Also, he's asking for ten
healthy women for the--
I am healthy.

294
00:23:46,984 --> 00:23:49,861
Bring your sister, okay?

295
00:23:53,985 --> 00:23:56,287
Chodz.

296
00:23:56,383 --> 00:23:59,644
You need to convince them
you have a trade, something
valuable to the war effort.

297
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:01,849
Like what?
What if you don't?
I'm a musician.

298
00:24:01,946 --> 00:24:05,398
Your name goes
on a list.
And they put you on trucks--

299
00:24:05,494 --> 00:24:07,508
No, no, no,
that's not true.
You're a musician?

300
00:24:07,603 --> 00:24:10,002
Yeah.
I'd fid a good
hiding place if I were you.

301
00:24:10,097 --> 00:24:14,412
I'm not going to hide
like some animal.
There are places to hide.

302
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:20,647
Der Naechste.!

303
00:24:20,744 --> 00:24:24,003
I'm a graduate
of the University of Lwow.

304
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:27,170
I used to work at the
hydroelectric station
in Roznow--

305
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:29,087
Blauschein.

306
00:24:32,252 --> 00:24:35,993
I'm gonna get the necessary
papers because this card
is no good anymore.

307
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:38,390
You can stay in this line
all day, you'll still get
one of these.

308
00:24:38,486 --> 00:24:42,034
They are no good.
You'll have to leave
the line now,

309
00:24:42,131 --> 00:24:46,542
then you'll get a blue card,
a Blauschein, to say that
you are an essential worker.

310
00:24:46,638 --> 00:24:49,610
I'll get these papers
for you at Pankiewicz.

311
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:51,529
Pharmacist. Just there, look.

312
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,448
Guess who is here?

313
00:24:53,543 --> 00:24:56,132
Poldek! Enjoying
the weather, Poldek?

314
00:24:56,229 --> 00:24:59,105
Enjoying the lines?
Need some shoe polish?

315
00:24:59,106 --> 00:25:01,599
In a metal container maybe?

316
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,915
Not essential?
I think you misunderstand
the meaning of the word.

317
00:25:06,011 --> 00:25:08,792
No Blauschein, sir.
Stand over there.

318
00:25:08,889 --> 00:25:11,573
Move. Next!

319
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,780
What do you mean,
"Not essential"?

320
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:19,342
I teach history and literature.
Since when is not essential?

321
00:25:24,425 --> 00:25:26,727
He's a metal polisher.

322
00:25:33,344 --> 00:25:36,030
It was not right?
It's very good.
He's 53 years old.

323
00:25:36,126 --> 00:25:39,099
It's too new. Mmm. Thank you.

324
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:49,360
You're crazy.
You left it
in your drawer.

325
00:25:49,361 --> 00:25:51,566
How many times have I told you?

326
00:25:51,663 --> 00:25:54,252
Your work certificate
you keep in your pocket
at all times.

327
00:25:54,348 --> 00:25:56,170
And you leave everything
in your drawer.

328
00:25:56,267 --> 00:25:58,568
How many times I've told you?

329
00:25:58,664 --> 00:26:01,732
I'm a metal polisher.

330
00:26:10,173 --> 00:26:12,666
Take the round sheet of tin,

331
00:26:12,762 --> 00:26:16,503
dip it in soap emulsion.

332
00:26:16,598 --> 00:26:21,489
Then place it centrally
in the press.

333
00:26:36,068 --> 00:26:39,328
We obtain the soup pot.
The soup pot.

334
00:26:39,424 --> 00:26:42,684
Soup pot.

335
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:45,754
Grosz, Mrs. Grosz,
stay together.

336
00:26:49,878 --> 00:26:54,864
Sir, I have ten work permits
here for the Deutsche
Emailwarenfabrik,

337
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:57,645
cosigned by Mr. Bankier
and myself.

338
00:26:57,646 --> 00:27:02,154
If it's carbonized,
clean it with a file.

339
00:27:02,249 --> 00:27:06,852
But don't touch
both the electrodes
at the same time.

340
00:27:06,853 --> 00:27:09,923
You'll get electrocuted.
Here, have a try.

341
00:27:14,142 --> 00:27:16,444
Roll the metal under the press,

342
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:18,841
but be very careful
unless you want your fingers...

343
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:21,623
to become part of the teapot.

344
00:27:23,157 --> 00:27:26,705
Occupation?
I'm a writer.
I play the flute.

345
00:27:26,706 --> 00:27:30,061
But Moses is
a skilled metalworker.

346
00:27:30,062 --> 00:27:32,269
He can make tin pots.
He can make tanks.

347
00:27:32,364 --> 00:27:34,187
He can make whatever
Mr. Schindler asks.

348
00:27:34,283 --> 00:27:36,775
He's highly skilled.
Give him your card.

349
00:27:36,776 --> 00:27:39,077
Moses, give him your card.

350
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:43,298
Now, dip the basin
with the tongs...

351
00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:45,792
into the enamel solution.

352
00:27:47,805 --> 00:27:52,026
And after swiveling it around,
carefully place it aside
to drip dry.

353
00:27:54,902 --> 00:27:58,260
And whatever he asks you,
allow me just to represent
you and speak for you.

354
00:27:58,355 --> 00:28:00,274
Don't say a word.

355
00:28:00,369 --> 00:28:03,726
Filing, billing, keeping track
of my appointments, shorthand.

356
00:28:03,727 --> 00:28:07,849
Typing, obviously.
How is your typing?
Uh, all right.

357
00:28:07,946 --> 00:28:09,768
Please.

358
00:29:00,502 --> 00:29:04,051
You need a secretary. Pick one.

359
00:29:04,052 --> 00:29:08,845
I don't know how.
They're all so...
qualified.

360
00:29:08,846 --> 00:29:11,723
You have to choose.

361
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,614
Prosze sie ladnie usmiechac.
Big smile.
Big smile.

362
00:29:16,615 --> 00:29:18,053
Uwaga.

363
00:29:22,082 --> 00:29:24,191
# ###

364
00:29:36,756 --> 00:29:39,537
If you would,
look after my guest.

365
00:29:39,632 --> 00:29:44,714
Um, boxed teas are good.
Coffiee, pate, um...

366
00:29:44,715 --> 00:29:48,744
kielbasa sausage,
cheeses, Beluga caviar.
Yes.

367
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:50,566
And, of course, who could live
without German cigarettes?

368
00:29:50,662 --> 00:29:52,771
Get me as many as you can fid.

369
00:29:52,868 --> 00:29:54,882
And some more fresh fruit.

370
00:29:54,978 --> 00:29:57,662
The real rarities--
oranges, lemons, pineapples.

371
00:29:57,663 --> 00:30:00,347
I need several boxes
of Cuban cigars. The best.
Yes.

372
00:30:00,348 --> 00:30:03,993
And dark, unsweetened chocolate.
Not in the shape ofladyfigers,
the chunk chocolate.

373
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:07,061
Yes.
Big as my hand,
you sample at wine tastings.

374
00:30:07,158 --> 00:30:10,226
We're going to need lots
of cognac. The best, Hennessy.

375
00:30:10,323 --> 00:30:15,501
Dom Perignon champagne.
Um, get L 'espadon sardines...

376
00:30:15,598 --> 00:30:18,475
and, oh,
try to fid nylon stockings.

377
00:30:20,872 --> 00:30:23,942
It is my distinct pleasure
to announce...

378
00:30:24,037 --> 00:30:29,408
the fully operational status
of Deutsche Email Fabrik...

379
00:30:29,504 --> 00:30:30,750
Patrzjakies szmaty.!

380
00:30:30,751 --> 00:30:34,106
Manufacturers of superior
enamelware crockery...

381
00:30:34,107 --> 00:30:39,381
expressly designed
and crafted for military use.

382
00:30:39,382 --> 00:30:41,972
Utilizing only
the most modern equipment,

383
00:30:42,068 --> 00:30:46,958
D.E.F. 's staff I of
highly-skilled and experienced
artisans andjourneymen...

384
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:50,412
deliver a product
of unparalleled quality,

385
00:30:50,507 --> 00:30:54,248
enabling me to proffier,
with absolute confidence
and pride,

386
00:30:54,344 --> 00:30:56,838
a full line
of field and kitchenware...

387
00:30:56,933 --> 00:31:00,865
unsurpassable in all respects
by my competitors.

388
00:31:00,962 --> 00:31:03,455
See attached list
and available colors.

389
00:31:03,551 --> 00:31:08,154
Anticipating the enclosed bids
will meet with your approval.

390
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,894
Made in Havana, Cuba.
Looking forward to a long and
mutually prosperous association.

391
00:31:11,991 --> 00:31:15,060
Look at this.
I extend to you in advance
my sincerest gratitude...

392
00:31:15,155 --> 00:31:17,936
and very best regards.
Oskar Schindler.

393
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:21,293
Yeah, I need 700 gross
from here for next Thursday.

394
00:31:21,389 --> 00:31:24,074
Nine hundred--
No, make it ten
for Wednesday.

395
00:31:24,075 --> 00:31:27,815
All this stuff here goes
to Madritsch's factory
on Tuesday of next week.

396
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:46,229
My father was fond of saying,
"You need three things in life

397
00:31:46,325 --> 00:31:50,257
"a good doctor,
a forgiving priest...

398
00:31:50,353 --> 00:31:53,423
and a clever accountant."

399
00:31:56,683 --> 00:32:00,615
The first two...
I've never had much use for.

400
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:03,971
But the third--

401
00:32:09,055 --> 00:32:12,411
Just pretend,
for Christ's sake.

402
00:32:15,961 --> 00:32:19,029
Is that all?

403
00:32:23,633 --> 00:32:26,701
I'm trying to thank you.

404
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:30,825
I'm saying I couldn't
have done this without you.

405
00:32:33,224 --> 00:32:36,005
The usual thing would be
to acknowledge my gratitude.

406
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,800
It would also, by the way,
be the courteous thing.

407
00:32:40,801 --> 00:32:43,582
You're welcome.

408
00:32:52,117 --> 00:32:54,227
Get out of here.

409
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:10,147
Klonowska, who is it?

410
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:21,656
She's so embarrassed.
Look at her.

411
00:33:33,165 --> 00:33:35,371
You know something?
You would like her.

412
00:33:35,467 --> 00:33:37,289
Oskar, please. What?

413
00:33:37,384 --> 00:33:39,686
I don't have to like her...
just because you do.
You would, though.

414
00:33:39,783 --> 00:33:42,467
It doesn't work that way.

415
00:33:54,648 --> 00:33:57,429
You've done well here.

416
00:33:59,732 --> 00:34:02,224
You look wonderful.

417
00:34:05,005 --> 00:34:08,363
Be careful
of the step, miss.
Mrs. Schindler, Marek.

418
00:34:14,884 --> 00:34:20,447
# #

419
00:34:20,543 --> 00:34:24,378
It's not a charade,
all this?
How could it

420
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:26,777
The clothes, the car,
the apartment.
Wait a minute.

421
00:34:26,778 --> 00:34:30,612
Take a guess how many
people are on my payroll.
Oskar.

422
00:34:30,613 --> 00:34:36,175
My father, at the height
of his success, had 50.
I've got 350.

423
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:40,300
350 workers
on the factory floor,
with one purpose.

424
00:34:40,395 --> 00:34:42,505
To make pots and pans?

425
00:34:42,602 --> 00:34:46,436
To make money. For me.

426
00:34:51,904 --> 00:34:54,974
Does anyone ask about me?

427
00:34:56,412 --> 00:34:59,481
Back home? Everybody.

428
00:34:59,577 --> 00:35:02,358
All the time.

429
00:35:02,454 --> 00:35:05,618
Hmm.

430
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:10,989
They won't soon forget
the name Schindler here,
I can tell you that.

431
00:35:12,428 --> 00:35:15,498
"Oskar Schindler," they'll say.

432
00:35:15,593 --> 00:35:18,854
"Everybody remembers him.

433
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:23,170
"He did something
extraordinary.

434
00:35:23,265 --> 00:35:28,157
"He did something
no one else did.

435
00:35:28,253 --> 00:35:31,418
"He came here with nothing--

436
00:35:31,513 --> 00:35:34,294
"a suitcase--

437
00:35:34,391 --> 00:35:39,760
"and built a bankrupt
company into a major
manufactory.

438
00:35:39,761 --> 00:35:43,214
"And left with
a steamer trunk--

439
00:35:43,311 --> 00:35:47,722
"Two steamer trunks
full of money,

440
00:35:47,818 --> 00:35:51,941
all the riches of the world."

441
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:53,858
Hmm.

442
00:35:53,859 --> 00:35:57,025
It's comforting to see
that nothing's changed.

443
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:00,573
You're wrong, Emilie.

444
00:36:00,574 --> 00:36:02,970
There's no way I could have
known this before,

445
00:36:02,971 --> 00:36:06,327
but there was always
something missing.

446
00:36:06,328 --> 00:36:10,260
In every business I tried,
I can see now, it wasn't me
that failed.

447
00:36:10,356 --> 00:36:13,040
Something was missing.

448
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:16,494
Even if I'd known what it
was, there's nothing I could
have done about it...

449
00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:21,001
because you can't
create this thing.

450
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:26,179
And it makes all
the difference in the world
between success and failure.

451
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,674
Luck?

452
00:36:30,976 --> 00:36:33,757
War.

453
00:36:56,295 --> 00:36:59,843
Should I stay?

454
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:04,542
It's a beautiful city.

455
00:37:04,543 --> 00:37:09,337
I asked you if I should stay.

456
00:37:09,338 --> 00:37:12,311
It's up to you.

457
00:37:16,052 --> 00:37:20,464
Promise me, Oskar,
no doorman or maitre d'
will ever presume...

458
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:25,739
I'm anyone other
than Mrs. Schindler,
and I'll stay.

459
00:37:27,848 --> 00:37:30,054
Good-bye, darling.

460
00:37:45,975 --> 00:37:50,003
I could try to read this
or I could eat my lunch
while it's still hot.

461
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:52,017
We're doing well?

462
00:37:52,112 --> 00:37:53,263
Yes.
Better this month
than last?

463
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,564
Yes.
Any reason
to think next month

464
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:58,730
The war could end.

465
00:38:08,225 --> 00:38:10,717
What?
There is a machinist
outside...

466
00:38:10,718 --> 00:38:13,692
who'd like to thank you
personally for giving him a job.

467
00:38:13,787 --> 00:38:18,295
Every day he comes.
He's very grateful.
It'll just take a minute.

468
00:38:24,337 --> 00:38:26,639
Mr. Lowenstein?

469
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:36,324
I want to thank you, sir,

470
00:38:36,325 --> 00:38:39,011
for giving me
the opportunity to work.

471
00:38:39,106 --> 00:38:41,889
You're welcome.
I'm sure you're doing
a great job.

472
00:38:41,984 --> 00:38:46,108
The SS beat me up.
They would have killed me,

473
00:38:46,204 --> 00:38:50,711
but I am essential
to the war effort,
thanks to you.

474
00:38:50,712 --> 00:38:52,628
That's great.

475
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:55,219
I work hard for you.

476
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:59,152
I'm sure you do.
I'll continue
to work hard for you.

477
00:38:59,247 --> 00:39:01,069
That's great. Thanks.

478
00:39:01,165 --> 00:39:03,562
God bless you, sir. All right.

479
00:39:03,563 --> 00:39:07,208
You are a good man.

480
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:11,522
He saved my life. Yes, he did.

481
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:14,304
God bless him. Yeah. Come on.

482
00:39:16,223 --> 00:39:19,004
God bless you.

483
00:39:30,513 --> 00:39:33,294
I'm sorry, Herr Direktor,
but you're running very late.

484
00:39:33,389 --> 00:39:36,554
This is for the
Obersturmbannfuehrer, sir.

485
00:39:36,555 --> 00:39:39,431
And this is for his niece,
Greta. It's her birthday.

486
00:39:39,432 --> 00:39:42,117
Greta as in Garbo.
By the way, don't ever
do that to me again.

487
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:44,706
Go. Go, go, drive! Don't bow.

488
00:39:44,707 --> 00:39:48,543
Did you happen to notice that
that man had one arm?
What? Did he?

489
00:39:52,092 --> 00:39:54,585
What's his use? Very useful.

490
00:39:57,175 --> 00:40:00,723
How? Very useful! Success!

491
00:40:08,108 --> 00:40:12,808
# #Achrar kach loe nedah # #

492
00:40:27,481 --> 00:40:30,549
Besen und Schaufeln
werden ausgeladen...

493
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:33,140
jeder nimmt sich eine und dann
wird die Strasse gereinigt.

494
00:40:33,235 --> 00:40:35,346
We'll be late for work.

495
00:40:47,142 --> 00:40:50,114
You shouldn't think of them
as yours, Oskar.

496
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:52,033
You need to understand that
some of the officers here...

497
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:54,719
don't give a damn
about production.

498
00:40:54,814 --> 00:40:58,745
To them, it's a matter of,
um, national priority...

499
00:40:58,746 --> 00:41:01,047
thatJews
be made to shovel snow.

500
00:41:01,048 --> 00:41:03,541
It's got nothing to do
with reality, Oskar.

501
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:05,556
You know it and I know it.

502
00:41:05,652 --> 00:41:07,858
Jews shoveling snow--

503
00:41:07,953 --> 00:41:12,462
It's got a, um,
ritual significance.

504
00:41:13,996 --> 00:41:17,352
Come with me.
I am an essential worker.

505
00:41:17,449 --> 00:41:20,037
Essential worker? Yes.

506
00:41:22,819 --> 00:41:26,272
I work for Oskar Schindler.
Essential worker
for Oskar Schindler.

507
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:29,628
A one-armed Jew?
Twice as useless!
Yes, yes.

508
00:41:29,725 --> 00:41:33,561
I lost a day
of production, Rolf.

509
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,725
I work for Oskar Schindler.

510
00:41:36,822 --> 00:41:40,657
Danka, look at the snow.
Look at the snow.
Look at the snow!

511
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:48,234
I lost a worker.
I expect to be compensated.

512
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:51,112
File a grievance
with the Economic Office.
It's your right.

513
00:41:51,207 --> 00:41:53,798
Would it do
any good?
Of course not.

514
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:00,702
A big shot from the SS Budget
and Construction Office
came to lunch...

515
00:42:00,703 --> 00:42:04,250
and he told us that to believe
theJewish skilled worker
had a place...

516
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:08,567
in Reich economics
was a treasonable idea.

517
00:42:11,828 --> 00:42:16,526
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?

518
00:42:16,527 --> 00:42:18,925
He was a metal press operator.

519
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,446
Quite skilled.

520
00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:55,368
Herr Direktor?

521
00:42:55,369 --> 00:42:57,670
Shit. I don't believe it.

522
00:42:57,671 --> 00:42:59,877
Stern, is that you?

523
00:42:59,973 --> 00:43:04,000
No, it's Poldek.
It's about Stern.

524
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:07,740
Leave your luggage
on the platform.

525
00:43:07,741 --> 00:43:09,756
Clearly label it.

526
00:43:09,851 --> 00:43:13,879
Given name first,
then your surname.

527
00:43:13,975 --> 00:43:16,469
Do not bring
your baggage with you.

528
00:43:16,564 --> 00:43:19,345
It will follow you later.

529
00:43:19,442 --> 00:43:22,511
Leave your luggage
on the platform.

530
00:43:22,606 --> 00:43:24,525
Clearly label it.

531
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:28,360
Lassen Sie Ihr Gepaeck
am Bahnsteig.

532
00:43:29,224 --> 00:43:31,143
Stern?

533
00:43:33,156 --> 00:43:36,129
He's on the list. He is?

534
00:43:36,226 --> 00:43:39,007
Well, let's find him.
I'm sorry.
You can't have him.

535
00:43:39,102 --> 00:43:41,884
He's on the list.
If he were an essential worker,
he would not be on the list.

536
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,569
I'm talking to a clerk.
What is your name?

537
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:47,638
Sir, the list
is correct.
I didn't ask you about the list.

538
00:43:47,735 --> 00:43:51,667
I asked you your name.
Klaus Tauber.

539
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:53,872
Tauber.

540
00:43:53,968 --> 00:43:57,707
Hauptscharfuehrer,
this gentleman thinks
a mistake's been made.

541
00:43:57,708 --> 00:44:00,106
My plant manager is
somewhere on this train.

542
00:44:00,202 --> 00:44:02,217
If it leaves with him on it,
it'll disrupt production...

543
00:44:02,312 --> 00:44:04,422
and the Armaments Board
will want to know why.

544
00:44:04,518 --> 00:44:06,723
Achtung, dieser Zug
faehrt jetzt ab.

545
00:44:06,724 --> 00:44:10,752
Is he on the list?
Yes, sir.
Itzhak Stern.

546
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:16,218
Well, the list
is correct, sir.
There is nothing I can do.

547
00:44:16,314 --> 00:44:19,191
- What is your name?
- Close and secure all doors.

548
00:44:19,288 --> 00:44:22,643
My name?
My name is Kunder.
This train is now leaving.

549
00:44:22,644 --> 00:44:25,041
Kunder.
Hauptscharfuehrer Kunder.

550
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:26,959
K-U-N-D-E-R.
And what's yours?

551
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,070
Schindler.
S-C-H-I-N-D-L-E-R.

552
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,371
Gentlemen, thank you very much.

553
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,960
I think I can guarantee you
you'll both be in...

554
00:44:34,057 --> 00:44:37,605
Southern Russia before the
end of the month. Good day.

555
00:44:37,702 --> 00:44:40,577
Zamykac dokladnie drzwi.
Dokladnie zamykac drzwi.

556
00:44:40,578 --> 00:44:42,593
Stern!

557
00:44:42,688 --> 00:44:44,510
Stern! Stern!

558
00:44:44,607 --> 00:44:46,429
Itzhak Stern!

559
00:44:52,567 --> 00:44:55,060
Stern! Itzhak Stern!

560
00:44:55,157 --> 00:44:57,841
Stern.! Stern.! Itzhak Stern.!

561
00:44:59,184 --> 00:45:00,335
Stern!

562
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:02,253
Sir?

563
00:45:03,596 --> 00:45:06,474
Stern! Herr Direktor.

564
00:45:06,569 --> 00:45:09,255
My apologies.

565
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:12,131
Stop the train!
He's here!
I apologize.

566
00:45:12,228 --> 00:45:17,024
- Stop the train!
- Stop the train! Stop it!

567
00:45:29,012 --> 00:45:32,656
Sign here. Initial there.

568
00:45:32,752 --> 00:45:36,683
Makes no difference
to us, you understand.
This one, that one.

569
00:45:36,684 --> 00:45:39,178
It's the inconvenience
to the list.

570
00:45:39,273 --> 00:45:42,917
It's the paperwork.
I somehow left
my work card at home.

571
00:45:42,918 --> 00:45:46,562
I tried to explain them
it was a mistake, but--

572
00:45:46,658 --> 00:45:50,589
I'm sorry, it was stupid!
What if I got here
five minutes later?

573
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:53,276
Then where would I be?

574
00:47:29,757 --> 00:47:31,197
Shechel.

575
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:34,073
Sacrean, sacrean end tzukeer.

576
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:36,567
Tzukeer end sacrean.

577
00:47:40,115 --> 00:47:42,609
I woke up from a dream
this morning.

578
00:47:42,706 --> 00:47:46,733
I was broke and sharing a room
with 12 people I didn't know,

579
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:51,912
only to discover
I was broke and sharing a room
with 12 people I didn't know.

580
00:47:52,872 --> 00:47:55,268
You laugh about it?
I have to laugh.

581
00:47:55,269 --> 00:47:58,145
You are living behind walls.

582
00:47:58,146 --> 00:48:02,750
The walls I can deal with.
It's the restrictions
to my life I'm tired of.

583
00:48:02,845 --> 00:48:05,818
Those walls keep them out.
That's all I care about.

584
00:48:05,914 --> 00:48:08,504
I like it here.
There's a kind of,
I don't know,

585
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,806
ancestral squalor to it all.

586
00:48:10,901 --> 00:48:13,011
You are a slave
to these people.
No one envies us anymore.

587
00:48:13,108 --> 00:48:15,121
I'm smart.
Oh, yes,
you're smart.

588
00:48:15,122 --> 00:48:17,327
You're
a real genius.
You had your chance.

589
00:48:17,424 --> 00:48:21,931
Today,
today I actually found time
to organize a thought.

590
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:24,711
I can't remember
the last time I did that.

591
00:48:24,712 --> 00:48:26,629
When's the last time
we did this?

592
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:28,933
When's the last time
we stood around and talked?

593
00:48:29,028 --> 00:48:32,193
No one ordered me
onto a truck today.

594
00:48:32,289 --> 00:48:34,495
No one took my business
away from me.

595
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:36,508
You don't really have
a business to take.

596
00:48:36,605 --> 00:48:38,809
There's nowhere down from here.

597
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:41,016
This is it. This is the bottom.

598
00:48:41,112 --> 00:48:44,661
The ghetto is... liberty.

599
00:48:50,607 --> 00:48:53,771
This street
divides the ghetto
just about in half.

600
00:48:53,868 --> 00:48:59,045
Civil employees,

601
00:48:59,046 --> 00:49:01,923
industrial workers and so on.

602
00:49:01,924 --> 00:49:06,720
Surplus labor,

603
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:09,117
the elderly and infirm mostly.

604
00:49:09,213 --> 00:49:12,090
Which is where you'll
want to start, huh?

605
00:49:12,185 --> 00:49:14,008
Do you have any questions, sir?

606
00:49:14,104 --> 00:49:17,557
Ja, why is the top down?
I'm fucking freezing.

607
00:49:19,667 --> 00:49:22,255
We expect a labor force
of 25,000 to 30,000.

608
00:49:22,256 --> 00:49:25,229
Segregated, of course.
The men in the barracks
near the quarry.

609
00:49:25,326 --> 00:49:26,572
The women on the other
side of the wire.

610
00:49:26,573 --> 00:49:29,066
My place is where? There, sir.

611
00:49:29,161 --> 00:49:32,422
There?
You call that a villa?
Yes, the villa.

612
00:49:32,518 --> 00:49:34,723
Their synagogue,
can you see it?
That's not a villa.

613
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:37,985
We're planning to turn it
into the camp stables.
It's a house.

614
00:49:38,081 --> 00:49:41,725
What's that over there?

615
00:49:41,821 --> 00:49:44,506
Kindergarten. Fifty-one.

616
00:49:44,507 --> 00:49:48,918
And we have
a dentist, shoemaker,
practical physicians.

617
00:49:50,932 --> 00:49:54,479
There they are, sir.

618
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,454
Hmm.

619
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:01,770
One of you is, uh,
a very lucky girl.

620
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:05,509
There is an opening for a job,

621
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:09,346
away from all this...
backbreaking work,

622
00:50:09,442 --> 00:50:12,799
at my new villa.

623
00:50:12,894 --> 00:50:17,306
Uh, which of you has...

624
00:50:17,403 --> 00:50:20,088
domestic experience?

625
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:26,897
Ja, on second thought,
I don't really want
someone else's maid.

626
00:50:26,994 --> 00:50:30,254
All those annoying habits
I have to undo.

627
00:50:34,953 --> 00:50:37,639
I don't want
to give you my cold.

628
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:39,844
Uh, what's your name?

629
00:50:39,941 --> 00:50:42,146
Helen Hirsch. What?

630
00:50:42,242 --> 00:50:44,065
Helen Hirsch.

631
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,284
What?
I can't hear.
Helen Hirsch.

632
00:51:03,438 --> 00:51:05,931
- Ja.
- Take it all down.!

633
00:51:06,027 --> 00:51:08,329
To work.!

634
00:51:08,425 --> 00:51:12,645
Take it down.! It is not safe.!

635
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:15,330
She says
the foundation was poured wrong.
She's got to take it down.

636
00:51:15,426 --> 00:51:18,399
I told her it's the barracks,
not the fucking Hotel Europa.

637
00:51:18,494 --> 00:51:22,618
Fucking Jew bitch engineer.
You fucking bitch!

638
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:26,743
Herr Kommandant.
The entire foundation...

639
00:51:26,839 --> 00:51:29,428
has to be torn down
and repoured.

640
00:51:29,524 --> 00:51:32,784
If not, there will be
at least a subsidence...

641
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:35,375
at the southern end
of the barracks.

642
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:37,963
Subsidence, and then collapse.

643
00:51:37,964 --> 00:51:40,650
And you are an engineer? Yes.

644
00:51:40,745 --> 00:51:43,047
My name is Diana Reiter.
I'm a graduate...

645
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:45,636
of Civil Engineering
from the University of Milan.

646
00:51:45,733 --> 00:51:49,377
Ah, an educated Jew,
like Karl Marx himself.

647
00:51:56,762 --> 00:51:59,926
Unterscharfuehrer.! Jawohl?

648
00:52:00,023 --> 00:52:04,050
Shoot her. What?

649
00:52:04,147 --> 00:52:08,558
Herr Kommandant,
I'm only trying to do my job.

650
00:52:08,654 --> 00:52:10,476
Ja, I'm doing mine.

651
00:52:10,573 --> 00:52:12,585
But, sir,
she's foreman
of construction.

652
00:52:12,586 --> 00:52:14,984
We are not going
to have arguments
with these people.

653
00:52:14,985 --> 00:52:16,902
Okay.

654
00:52:18,437 --> 00:52:21,697
No. Shoot her here,
on my authority.

655
00:52:32,343 --> 00:52:34,452
It will take more than that.

656
00:52:34,549 --> 00:52:37,714
I'm sure you're right.

657
00:52:43,469 --> 00:52:48,167
Take it down, repour it,
rebuild it. Like she said.

658
00:52:48,263 --> 00:52:51,716
We have more to see,
but we have only one more
hour of light.

659
00:52:54,017 --> 00:52:57,662
# #

660
00:53:02,649 --> 00:53:06,581
Today is history.

661
00:53:06,677 --> 00:53:09,939
Today will be remembered.

662
00:53:10,034 --> 00:53:15,692
Years from now, the young
will ask with wonder...

663
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:18,090
about this day.

664
00:53:18,186 --> 00:53:22,980
Today is history,
and you are part of it.

665
00:53:22,981 --> 00:53:25,954
Six hundred years ago...

666
00:53:26,051 --> 00:53:28,353
# #

667
00:53:28,448 --> 00:53:32,379
When elsewhere they were footing
the blame for the Black Death,
Kazimierz the Great, so-called,

668
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:35,544
# #Ke laolam chasedo ##
told theJews
they could come to Krakow.

669
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:38,614
- Chaja, bread.
- They came.

670
00:53:38,711 --> 00:53:41,779
Not that fat. No, less.
They trundled their belongings
into the city.

671
00:53:41,875 --> 00:53:43,697
Yes, a bit less. They settled.

672
00:53:43,794 --> 00:53:49,069
They took hold.
They prospered...

673
00:53:49,164 --> 00:53:54,055
in business, science,
education, the arts.

674
00:53:54,151 --> 00:53:56,741
They came here with nothing.

675
00:53:56,836 --> 00:53:59,042
# ### Nothing.

676
00:54:00,193 --> 00:54:02,781
And they flourished.

677
00:54:02,782 --> 00:54:08,344
For six centuries
there has been a Jewish Krakow.

678
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:11,510
Think about that.

679
00:54:11,607 --> 00:54:13,428
By this evening,

680
00:54:13,524 --> 00:54:17,456
those six centuries
are a rumor.

681
00:54:17,552 --> 00:54:21,292
They never happened.

682
00:54:21,293 --> 00:54:24,937
Today is history.

683
00:54:44,022 --> 00:54:46,900
Absitzen und in Zweierreihen
antreten.!

684
00:54:46,995 --> 00:54:48,818
Kameraden.! Schneller.!

685
00:54:52,078 --> 00:54:57,642
I think we will start...
with Ghetto B.

686
00:54:57,737 --> 00:55:00,806
Hopp, hopp, hopp, hopp.!

687
00:55:05,985 --> 00:55:08,382
All right?
Start from
both sides?

688
00:55:08,479 --> 00:55:10,492
I would like you
to start there.
The right side?

689
00:55:10,493 --> 00:55:13,083
The right side, yeah.
And then move around.
Okay.

690
00:55:15,096 --> 00:55:19,316
Beschriften Sie es deutlich.
Es wird Ihnen nachgeschickt.

691
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:24,399
Lassen Sie Ihr Gepaeck stehen.

692
00:55:24,495 --> 00:55:28,139
Beschriften Sie es deutlich.

693
00:55:28,236 --> 00:55:31,592
Es wird Ihnen nachgeschickt.

694
00:55:31,689 --> 00:55:34,086
Aufmachen! Lakoom.

695
00:55:34,181 --> 00:55:37,346
Loe ani loe yodahat olay
kaday lehachnese at hayladeem

696
00:55:37,443 --> 00:55:40,415
Mitacht la meeta. Bohow.

697
00:55:43,868 --> 00:55:48,184
Hopp, hopp, hopp, hopp!

698
00:55:56,816 --> 00:55:59,118
'Runterkommen!

699
00:56:24,629 --> 00:56:26,931
'Rauskommen, Juden!

700
00:56:33,357 --> 00:56:36,617
Ziehen Sie sich warm an!
Kommen Sie 'raus!

701
00:56:42,372 --> 00:56:44,577
Na Platz!

702
00:56:53,112 --> 00:56:56,565
Gold, Chaim! Platz Chodi.

703
00:56:56,662 --> 00:56:59,729
Gold, Chaim! Yes, Chaim Gold.

704
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:02,129
Shoot him.

705
00:57:07,211 --> 00:57:10,280
- Nie zabijaj.!
- Nie zabijaj.!

706
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:13,444
Ziehen Sie warme Kleidung an
und begeben Sie sich zum Platz--

707
00:57:13,445 --> 00:57:16,418
Keine Koffier.! Keine Koffier.!

708
00:57:16,993 --> 00:57:20,543
Gehen Sie durch.!
Keine Koffier.! Keine Koffier.!

709
00:57:20,638 --> 00:57:23,323
Hey, little boy.
Wie alt bist du, huh?

710
00:57:23,324 --> 00:57:27,064
Na, wie hiesst du?
Wie heisst du, huh?

711
00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:29,653
Keine Koffier, hab'ich gesagt.!

712
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:32,051
Packt keine Koffier.!
Keine Koffier.!

713
00:57:32,147 --> 00:57:35,215
'Rueber zum Platz Chodi.!
Koffier hierlassen.!

714
00:57:35,312 --> 00:57:38,188
Blauschein. Platz Chodi.!

715
00:57:38,189 --> 00:57:40,395
Was soll der Koffier hier?

716
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:43,464
Alles 'rueber zum Platz Chodi.!

717
00:57:58,521 --> 00:58:00,247
We're getting out
through the sewers.

718
00:58:00,248 --> 00:58:02,933
I have to check
if they're clear.

719
00:58:03,028 --> 00:58:05,906
Mila, pack some things.
Nothing bigger than this.
I can't go in the sewers.

720
00:58:06,002 --> 00:58:09,167
I told you I won't go
in the sewers.

721
00:58:12,043 --> 00:58:15,305
You can go. Yes, you can.

722
00:58:17,415 --> 00:58:19,428
I won't go in the sewers.

723
00:58:29,786 --> 00:58:34,007
Move! Over there!
Over there! Move!

724
00:58:34,102 --> 00:58:36,307
Your card, Jew!

725
00:58:36,308 --> 00:58:38,705
Deine Papiere, Jude!

726
00:58:38,706 --> 00:58:41,295
Deine Papiere, Jude.!

727
00:58:42,734 --> 00:58:45,228
That line.

728
00:58:45,323 --> 00:58:46,569
Deine Karte.!

729
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:50,214
Ich geh'nicht 'rauf
wegen Deiner verdammten Karte.!

730
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:53,764
Deine Scheisskarte!

731
00:59:11,698 --> 00:59:13,903
Was soll denn die Scheisse?
Bist du denn verrueckt geworden?

732
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,397
Mit diesem Scheissgewehr
haettest du mich
erschiessen koennen.!

733
00:59:16,493 --> 00:59:18,411
Du hast so nah an mir
vorbeigeschossen.!

734
00:59:18,507 --> 00:59:20,905
Was heisst hier Entschuldigung.
Du bist wohl verrueckt geworden.!

735
00:59:20,906 --> 00:59:24,069
Zurueckbleiben! Zurueckbleiben!

736
00:59:28,193 --> 00:59:31,837
Nicht sprechen, nicht sprechen!
Einfach zu den Lastwagen gehen!

737
00:59:31,838 --> 00:59:34,332
Weiterlaufen! Weiterlaufen!
Nicht sprechen!

738
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:45,936
Komm her, du Judensau.!

739
00:59:46,033 --> 00:59:48,142
Bleib stehen, hab'ich gesagt.
Bleib stehen.!

740
00:59:59,172 --> 01:00:02,145
Chodzcie tu szybko.!

741
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,878
She's good as dead. Leave her.

742
01:00:45,974 --> 01:00:49,426
Give me a moment.
Just let me bring her inside.

743
01:00:54,701 --> 01:00:58,250
You can join her...
or join the line.

744
01:01:02,854 --> 01:01:05,155
Women to the left.!
Wilhelm!
Rose!

745
01:01:05,156 --> 01:01:07,937
- Men to right.
- Women to the left.

746
01:01:08,032 --> 01:01:10,621
Women to the left. Let me go!

747
01:01:15,225 --> 01:01:18,678
Women to the left,
and men to the right.
Promise me, be safe.

748
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:23,473
Your government
is in the wrong country.!

749
01:01:29,132 --> 01:01:31,337
Mama! Mama!

750
01:02:17,564 --> 01:02:19,387
Mila!

751
01:02:44,611 --> 01:02:48,063
Oh, God, Danka!

752
01:02:51,899 --> 01:02:54,583
You have a Blauschein.
Blauschein doesn't
matter anymore.

753
01:02:54,584 --> 01:02:57,269
They are cleaning
out the ghetto.
There's not enough room for you.

754
01:02:57,270 --> 01:03:00,818
What are you talking about?
We tried it before.
There's more than enough room.

755
01:03:00,915 --> 01:03:03,791
- I changed my mind!
- Mama!

756
01:03:03,888 --> 01:03:08,108
Look at the space in there.
Now look at me.
You are just scared.

757
01:03:08,203 --> 01:03:10,408
I can fit the girl,
but not you.

758
01:03:10,409 --> 01:03:12,806
- Mama, I'm coming out!
- Stay where you are.

759
01:03:12,903 --> 01:03:14,821
I'd rather you be here
than who knows where.

760
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,739
Mama.!

761
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:38,318
Herr Kommandant.!

762
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:40,523
Very good saluting.

763
01:03:40,524 --> 01:03:44,168
I respectfully report
I've been given orders to clear
the bundles from the road...

764
01:03:44,169 --> 01:03:47,236
so there will be no obstructions
to the thoroughfare.

765
01:03:47,237 --> 01:03:51,649
Finish and join the lines,

766
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,338
Mrs. Dresner?

767
01:04:15,433 --> 01:04:17,256
Yes.

768
01:04:17,352 --> 01:04:19,654
Oh, you are a friend
of my son's.

769
01:04:19,749 --> 01:04:22,051
Don't worry, I'll go quietly.
I'll be no trouble.

770
01:04:22,148 --> 01:04:26,272
No, get under the stairs.
They'll be done searching soon.
You'll be safe there.

771
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:29,532
Please hide! Please!
...warmed by the sun.

772
01:04:29,628 --> 01:04:31,930
Hide under the stairs.

773
01:04:34,423 --> 01:04:37,108
I've searched the building.
There's no one here.

774
01:04:37,109 --> 01:04:39,986
Also, gehen wir
zum naechsten Block.
Einverstanden.

775
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:49,480
Danka.! Ah.! Mama!

776
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:56,769
Hello, Adam.

777
01:04:56,865 --> 01:04:58,879
H-Hello, Danka.

778
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:08,470
Come with me.
I will put you
in the good line.

779
01:05:10,196 --> 01:05:13,265
Do you know the saying, "An hour
of life is still life"?

780
01:05:13,266 --> 01:05:17,390
You are not a boy anymore.
I'm saying a blessing for you.

Jawohl.

01:13:32,746 --> 01:13:35,048
Na komm! Na komm!

843
01:13:38,021 --> 01:13:41,186
Amon, you're such
a damned fuckin' child!

844
01:13:41,187 --> 01:13:43,296
Wakey, wakey.

845
01:13:52,695 --> 01:13:56,148
Make coffiee. Make it yourself.

846
01:14:09,959 --> 01:14:11,683
The SS will manage...

847
01:14:11,684 --> 01:14:14,657
certain industries itself
inside Plaszow--

848
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:17,342
a metalworks, brush factory,

849
01:14:17,343 --> 01:14:19,549
another for reprocessing
Jewish clothing...

850
01:14:19,550 --> 01:14:23,384
from the ghettos for use by
bombed-out families back home.

851
01:14:23,385 --> 01:14:26,454
But it's private industry
like yours that stands
to benefit most...

852
01:14:26,455 --> 01:14:28,757
by moving inside the wire of
Commandant Amon Goeth's camp--

853
01:14:28,758 --> 01:14:31,538
No, no, no. Sit, sit.
Julian, how are you?

854
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:32,976
How are you?
Good to see you,
my friend.

855
01:14:33,072 --> 01:14:35,757
Oskar Schindler. LeoJohn.

856
01:14:39,115 --> 01:14:42,279
Franz, good to see you.
Hello, Oskar.
Glad you could join us.

857
01:14:42,375 --> 01:14:45,347
My pleasure. Julius.
How are you?
You lost weight.

858
01:14:45,348 --> 01:14:49,280
Only in the shoulders.
Please, everybody, sit down.

859
01:14:49,376 --> 01:14:51,965
How are you doing?
Oskar Schindler.

860
01:14:53,595 --> 01:14:56,857
We started without you.
Fine.
I miss anything good?

861
01:14:56,953 --> 01:15:00,021
I was explaining
to Herr Bosch
and Herr Madritsch...

862
01:15:00,118 --> 01:15:02,898
some of the benefits
of moving their
factories into Plaszow.

863
01:15:02,899 --> 01:15:05,776
I meant the food.

864
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:11,722
Since your labor is housed
on-site, it's available
to you at all times.

865
01:15:11,819 --> 01:15:13,928
You can work them
all night if you want.

866
01:15:14,024 --> 01:15:18,339
Your factory policies, whatever
they've been in the past,
they'll continue to be.

867
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:20,450
They'll be respected.

868
01:15:20,546 --> 01:15:24,669
I have to know, where
do you get a suit like that?
What is that? Is that silk?

869
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:26,587
Of course.

870
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:30,712
Ja. It's-- It has
a nice sheen about it.

871
01:15:30,807 --> 01:15:32,630
Thank you. Very nice.

872
01:15:32,726 --> 01:15:36,370
I'd say I'd get you one,
but the man who made it
is probably dead.

873
01:15:36,466 --> 01:15:38,864
I don't know.

874
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,603
I go to work the other day.

875
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:44,810
Nobody's there.

876
01:15:44,905 --> 01:15:48,167
Nobody tells me about this.
I have to fid out.
I have to go in.

877
01:15:48,263 --> 01:15:51,620
Everybody's gone.

878
01:15:51,715 --> 01:15:54,496
No.

879
01:15:54,593 --> 01:15:56,606
No.

880
01:15:59,196 --> 01:16:01,689
They're not gone. They're here.

881
01:16:01,786 --> 01:16:06,580
They're mine!
Every day that goes by,
I'm losing money.

882
01:16:06,581 --> 01:16:10,609
Every worker that is shot
costs me money. I have to
find somebody else.

883
01:16:10,705 --> 01:16:13,198
We are going to be making
so much money that none of this
is going to matter.

884
01:16:13,294 --> 01:16:14,733
It's bad business.

885
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,118
Thank you.

886
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:31,612
Leave the bottle.

887
01:16:32,763 --> 01:16:34,874
Take that.

888
01:16:34,969 --> 01:16:38,422
Lena... thank you.

889
01:16:47,341 --> 01:16:50,315
Scherner told me
something else about you.

890
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,820
Yeah? What's that?

891
01:16:54,821 --> 01:16:59,330
That you know the meaning
of the word "gratitude."

892
01:16:59,425 --> 01:17:02,782
That it's not
some vague thing with you...

893
01:17:02,878 --> 01:17:05,946
like it is with others.

894
01:17:05,947 --> 01:17:09,303
You want to stay where you are.

895
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:12,373
You've got things
going on the side.

896
01:17:12,469 --> 01:17:14,483
Things are good.

897
01:17:14,578 --> 01:17:18,894
You don't want anybody
telling you what to do.

898
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:23,306
I can understand all that,
you know. I-- I know you.

899
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:30,307
What you want...
is your own sub-camp.

900
01:17:35,486 --> 01:17:38,843
Do you have any idea
what is involved?
The paperwork alone?

901
01:17:38,939 --> 01:17:42,870
You've got to build the thing.
Getting those fucking permits
is enough to drive you crazy.

902
01:17:42,871 --> 01:17:46,899
Then the engineers show up,
they stand around, they argue
about drainage, foundations,

903
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:51,982
codes, exact specifications,
fences four kilometers long,
1,200 kilograms of barbed wire,

904
01:17:52,078 --> 01:17:55,242
6,000 kilograms of electrified
fences, ceramic insulators,

905
01:17:55,243 --> 01:17:56,969
three cubic meters
of air space per prisoner.

906
01:17:56,970 --> 01:18:00,900
I'm telling you,
you want to shoot somebody.
I've been through it. I know.

907
01:18:00,901 --> 01:18:04,546
- Well, you know.
- You've been through it.

908
01:18:06,368 --> 01:18:09,341
You could make things
easier for me.

909
01:18:12,219 --> 01:18:14,232
I'd be grateful.

910
01:18:17,685 --> 01:18:19,986
Aus dem Weg da.!

911
01:18:29,673 --> 01:18:33,414
- Weitergehen.!
- Weitergehen.!

912
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:37,921
Wlewo zwrot.! Trzymac szereg.!

913
01:18:38,018 --> 01:18:40,799
Weitergehen. Nach links.

914
01:18:48,087 --> 01:18:50,006
Where's Stern?

915
01:18:53,554 --> 01:18:57,486
Goldberg and Chilowicz...
make sure I see my cut...

916
01:18:57,582 --> 01:19:00,939
from the, uh,
factory owners in this camp,

917
01:19:01,035 --> 01:19:04,296
leaving you to take care
of my main account--

918
01:19:04,391 --> 01:19:07,556
the Schindler account.

919
01:19:07,652 --> 01:19:11,488
He wants his independence.
I gave it to him.

920
01:19:11,585 --> 01:19:14,366
But independence costs money.

921
01:19:14,462 --> 01:19:16,763
This you understand?

922
01:19:21,462 --> 01:19:23,285
Look at me.

923
01:19:33,547 --> 01:19:37,479
Don't forget who
you are working for now.

924
01:19:44,672 --> 01:19:46,591
# ###

925
01:19:46,686 --> 01:19:49,755
- Jawohl.!
- Make sure he kisses

926
01:19:49,851 --> 01:19:53,112
Ja. Now, girls, everyone.

927
01:19:55,893 --> 01:19:58,387
We need more wine. More wine!

928
01:19:58,482 --> 01:20:02,126
Stand in my place.
Don't let him leave.

929
01:20:17,472 --> 01:20:20,733
# # Was passiert denn
in einem Leben ##
Prost.! Prost.!

930
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:25,241
Thank you, Herr Direktor.

931
01:20:25,337 --> 01:20:27,638
Prost, Herr Direktor!

932
01:20:31,570 --> 01:20:34,928
What are you doing? What?

933
01:20:35,023 --> 01:20:39,243
- Makes them think we have lice.
- Helps them keep their distance.

934
01:20:39,339 --> 01:20:41,736
Do you have lice?
Do you have your notebook?

935
01:20:41,833 --> 01:20:45,286
The calendar on my desk has
the birthdays of our SS friends'
wives and children.

936
01:20:45,381 --> 01:20:47,874
Don't forget to send something.

937
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:51,232
Record payoffs
to the Main Administration
and Economics Office, the Arm--

938
01:20:51,327 --> 01:20:55,067
Slower, Stern, slower.
The Armaments Board,
Governor General's Division...

939
01:20:55,164 --> 01:20:57,945
of the Interior
and Chief of Police as "fees,"

940
01:20:58,041 --> 01:20:59,958
and make them
on the first of each month,

941
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:02,260
as opposed to individual payoffs
to our SS contacts.

942
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:07,535
The list is in the lower drawer
of my desk, which you--
"First of month--"

943
01:21:07,632 --> 01:21:10,413
list,
lower drawer of my desk,
which you handle...

944
01:21:10,508 --> 01:21:14,537
as cash contributions
to legitimate charities
sent to each official's office.

945
01:21:14,632 --> 01:21:17,605
Dealings with
our black market contacts,
listed as suppliers...

946
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:21,155
in the legitimate ledger,
are more complicated.
Forget it.

947
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:24,990
What do you mean, forget it?
You can't forget it!
It gives me a headache!

948
01:21:31,513 --> 01:21:34,772
I couldn't get you
out of here.
I'll be all right.

949
01:21:34,773 --> 01:21:38,800
Anyway, I'm here
almost every week.
Wednesdays, usually.

950
01:21:38,801 --> 01:21:42,158
I'll look in on you,
see how you're doing.

951
01:21:44,172 --> 01:21:47,719
Here, put these in your pocket.

952
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:49,735
Come on.

953
01:21:52,419 --> 01:21:55,681
Herr Direktor,
don't let things fall apart.

954
01:21:55,776 --> 01:21:57,886
I've worked too hard.

955
01:22:05,847 --> 01:22:10,258
Thanks for-- Good luck.

956
01:22:10,354 --> 01:22:14,095
# #

957
01:22:31,166 --> 01:22:33,468
Achtung, Muetzen ab.!

958
01:22:42,962 --> 01:22:45,360
- Work!
- An die Arbeit.!

959
01:22:58,500 --> 01:22:59,938
What are you making?

960
01:23:00,226 --> 01:23:02,623
Hinges, sir.

961
01:23:05,405 --> 01:23:08,858
Ja, I've got some workers
coming in tomorrow.
Where are they from again?

962
01:23:08,953 --> 01:23:11,254
Yugoslavia, Herr Kommandant.

963
01:23:11,255 --> 01:23:13,461
I've got to make room.

964
01:23:15,763 --> 01:23:18,927
Make me a hinge. Yes, sir.

965
01:23:49,042 --> 01:23:52,112
Keep going, you're doing well.

966
01:23:52,207 --> 01:23:54,221
Says he's doing well.

967
01:24:00,647 --> 01:24:03,235
Oh, that's very good.

968
01:24:03,236 --> 01:24:07,073
But I'm a bit confused,
and perhaps you can help me.

969
01:24:07,169 --> 01:24:10,429
What I don't understand
is that you've been working...

970
01:24:10,526 --> 01:24:14,074
since I think, what,
about six this morning?

971
01:24:15,609 --> 01:24:19,828
Yet such a small pile
of hinges.

972
01:24:47,737 --> 01:24:50,517
Oh, Christ.
May I try that, sir?

973
01:24:50,518 --> 01:24:52,723
Check the angle-lever.
Maybe it's bent.

974
01:24:52,724 --> 01:24:56,081
No, no.
You wouldn't hear a click
if it was the angle-lever.

975
01:24:56,177 --> 01:24:58,479
Maybe it's the pin.
Maybe the pin shaft is greasy.
Ja, come on.

976
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:01,452
What did I just say? Here.

977
01:25:02,795 --> 01:25:06,247
Herr Kommandant,

978
01:25:06,343 --> 01:25:10,659
I beg to report
that my heap of hinges
was so unsatisfactory...

979
01:25:10,754 --> 01:25:14,878
because the machines
were being recalibrated
this morning.

980
01:25:14,975 --> 01:25:19,674
I w-was put on
to shoveling coal.

981
01:25:42,499 --> 01:25:44,514
Strange, huh?

982
01:25:44,609 --> 01:25:46,431
Yeah.

983
01:25:51,035 --> 01:25:54,105
Thank you, Muek.

984
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:57,940
Ah, Lisiek.
Don't touch the leather,
it's just been oiled.

985
01:25:58,037 --> 01:25:59,666
Rottenfuehrer. Oh, for me?

986
01:25:59,667 --> 01:26:03,215
Oh, thank you very much,
Herr Direktor. Thank you.
Herr Direktor!

987
01:26:03,312 --> 01:26:05,709
Herr Direktor.!

988
01:26:08,203 --> 01:26:10,696
Herr Direktor.!

989
01:26:11,847 --> 01:26:13,765
He was making hinges slowly.

990
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:18,561
So the man can turn out a hinge
in less than a minute.
Why the long story? Hmm?

991
01:26:46,469 --> 01:26:49,155
Thank you, sir. You're welcome.

992
01:26:52,223 --> 01:26:56,059
Nobody knows
who stole the chicken, hmm?
Tell him about the chicken.

993
01:26:56,060 --> 01:27:00,664
A man walks around
with a chicken and
nobody notices this.

994
01:27:00,759 --> 01:27:03,157
Save yourselves.

995
01:27:03,253 --> 01:27:05,554
Tell him about the chicken.

996
01:27:20,612 --> 01:27:22,626
Still nobody knows.

997
01:27:33,847 --> 01:27:37,491
It was you.
You committed this crime.

998
01:27:37,492 --> 01:27:39,793
No, sir.
But you know who, though.

999
01:27:39,889 --> 01:27:42,095
Yes. Who?

1000
01:27:42,191 --> 01:27:45,068
Him!

1001
01:27:48,424 --> 01:27:52,166
He's very gifted.
Yeah, sure.
Bring him over.

1002
01:27:54,850 --> 01:27:58,591
Yes, sir. Thank you.

1003
01:28:04,441 --> 01:28:07,221
Thank you again,
Herr Direktor.
You're welcome again.

1004
01:28:07,222 --> 01:28:10,867
It's an honor to work
for such a great company.
It's great to have you.

1005
01:28:10,963 --> 01:28:14,991
I promise to learn everything
about enamelware production.
That's great.

1006
01:28:26,979 --> 01:28:31,006
Hello?
Miss Elsa Krause is here.
I only need five minutes.

1007
01:28:31,007 --> 01:28:33,692
She wants to speak
to the Herr Direktor.

1008
01:28:52,394 --> 01:28:54,505
Yes.

1009
01:28:58,532 --> 01:29:00,739
He won't see you.

1010
01:29:30,086 --> 01:29:32,100
Please, sit down.

1011
01:29:35,169 --> 01:29:37,950
Pernod? Cognac? Uh, no.

1012
01:29:39,101 --> 01:29:41,882
So, what can I do for you?

1013
01:29:45,718 --> 01:29:48,691
They say that no one dies here.

1014
01:29:48,692 --> 01:29:51,281
They say your factory
is a haven.

1015
01:29:53,967 --> 01:29:56,173
They say you are good.

1016
01:29:59,050 --> 01:30:01,159
Who says that?

1017
01:30:01,256 --> 01:30:03,269
Everyone.

1018
01:30:09,407 --> 01:30:12,189
My name is Regina Perlman,
not Elsa Krause.

1019
01:30:12,285 --> 01:30:15,354
I've been living in Krakow
on false papers since
the ghetto massacre.

1020
01:30:15,449 --> 01:30:16,889
My parents are in Plaszow.

1021
01:30:16,984 --> 01:30:21,300
Their names are
Chana and Jakob Perlman.

1022
01:30:21,396 --> 01:30:25,039
They are older people.
They are killing older people
now in Plaszow.

1023
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:28,877
They bury them
up in the forest. Look...

1024
01:30:28,972 --> 01:30:31,754
I don't have any money.

1025
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:34,631
I, I borrowed these clothes.

1026
01:30:37,221 --> 01:30:39,235
I'm begging you.

1027
01:30:39,330 --> 01:30:43,070
Please, please bring them here.

1028
01:30:43,167 --> 01:30:45,563
I don't do that.

1029
01:30:45,564 --> 01:30:49,400
You've been misled.
I ask one thing:

1030
01:30:49,401 --> 01:30:52,565
whether or not a worker
has certain skills.

1031
01:30:52,566 --> 01:30:55,347
My father is an importer,
not a metalworker.

1032
01:30:55,443 --> 01:30:59,183
Such activities are illegal.
You will not entrap me!

1033
01:30:59,279 --> 01:31:03,403
Cry, and I will
have you arrested.
I swear to God!

1034
01:31:12,706 --> 01:31:15,295
People die.
It's a fact of life.

1035
01:31:15,391 --> 01:31:19,036
He wants to kill everybody?
Great! What am I supposed
to do about it?

1036
01:31:19,132 --> 01:31:21,721
Bring everybody over?
Is that what you think?

1037
01:31:21,817 --> 01:31:24,597
Send them over to Schindler.
Send them all!

1038
01:31:24,598 --> 01:31:28,147
His place is a haven,
didn't you know?
It's not a factory.

1039
01:31:28,243 --> 01:31:30,447
It's not an enterprise
of any kind.

1040
01:31:30,448 --> 01:31:33,229
It's a haven for rabbis
and orphans...

1041
01:31:33,326 --> 01:31:36,490
and people with
no skills whatsoever!

1042
01:31:37,738 --> 01:31:41,861
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

1043
01:31:41,862 --> 01:31:45,314
You're so quiet
all the time.
I know, I know!

1044
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:48,191
Are you losing money?
That's not the point!

1045
01:31:48,287 --> 01:31:52,028
What other point is--
It's dangerous!
It's dangerous to me!

1046
01:31:54,359 --> 01:31:57,811
You have to understand.
Goeth is under enormous
pressure.

1047
01:31:57,907 --> 01:32:00,976
You have to think of it
in his situation.

1048
01:32:01,072 --> 01:32:03,853
He's got this
whole place to run.

1049
01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:06,731
He's responsible
for everything here,
all these people.

1050
01:32:06,826 --> 01:32:09,703
He's got a lot of things
to worry about.

1051
01:32:09,704 --> 01:32:13,732
And he's got the war
which brings out
the worst in people.

1052
01:32:13,828 --> 01:32:17,089
Never the good,
always the bad.
Always the bad.

1053
01:32:19,294 --> 01:32:23,707
But in normal circumstances
he wouldn't be like this.
He'd be all right.

1054
01:32:23,802 --> 01:32:27,158
There'd just be the good
aspects of him which--

1055
01:32:27,159 --> 01:32:30,707
He's a wonderful crook.

1056
01:32:30,803 --> 01:32:35,023
A man who loves good food,
good wine, the ladies,
making money--

1057
01:32:35,119 --> 01:32:37,324
Killing.

1058
01:32:37,325 --> 01:32:40,010
He can't enjoy it.

1059
01:32:40,106 --> 01:32:43,079
Bejski told me the other day,
somebody escaped...

1060
01:32:43,175 --> 01:32:45,860
from a work detail
outside the wire.

1061
01:32:45,861 --> 01:32:49,697
Goeth lined up everybody
from the missing man's barracks.

1062
01:32:49,793 --> 01:32:53,724
He shot the man
to the left of Bejski,
the man to the right ofhim.

1063
01:32:53,725 --> 01:32:57,369
He walked down the line
shooting every other man
with the pistol.

1064
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:04,659
Twenty-five.

1065
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:11,947
What do you want me
to do about it?
Nothing, nothing.

1066
01:33:12,043 --> 01:33:14,249
We're just talking.

1067
01:33:25,470 --> 01:33:27,292
"Perlman."

1068
01:33:28,923 --> 01:33:30,936
Perlman!

1069
01:33:30,937 --> 01:33:33,621
Husband and wife.

1070
01:33:33,718 --> 01:33:37,363
Jakob and Chana Perlman!

1071
01:33:50,022 --> 01:33:53,186
Have Goldberg bring them over.

1072
01:33:55,009 --> 01:33:58,269
Muetzen ab!

1073
01:33:58,366 --> 01:34:00,380
Appell abtreten!

1074
01:34:34,715 --> 01:34:38,551
# #

1075
01:34:46,223 --> 01:34:50,155
I'm sure this will be better
than those rags, Lisiek.

1076
01:34:50,251 --> 01:34:53,992
Herr Direktor,
I was just helping Lisiek
to find something...

1077
01:34:54,087 --> 01:34:56,869
to clean the stains
from the Herr Kommandant's
bathtub.

1078
01:34:56,965 --> 01:34:59,746
Go, please.
Pardon me,
Herr Direktor.

1079
01:35:01,569 --> 01:35:06,075
You don't have to report
to me, Helen.

1080
01:35:06,076 --> 01:35:09,241
You know who I am? Hmm?

1081
01:35:16,913 --> 01:35:20,174
I'm Schindler.

1082
01:35:20,270 --> 01:35:23,243
Of course.
I-I have heard and...

1083
01:35:23,339 --> 01:35:26,217
you have been here before.

1084
01:35:28,326 --> 01:35:31,203
Here, why don't you
keep this someplace?

1085
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:34,656
Go on, take it.
I get extra food here.

1086
01:35:34,752 --> 01:35:39,259
Well, if you don't
want to eat it, trade it.
Or give it to Lisiek.

1087
01:35:41,945 --> 01:35:44,151
Why not build yourself up?

1088
01:35:48,563 --> 01:35:52,398
My first day here,
he beat me...

1089
01:35:52,495 --> 01:35:56,235
because I threw out
the bones from dinner.

1090
01:35:59,303 --> 01:36:03,620
He came down to the basement
at midnight, and he--

1091
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:06,305
he asked me where they were.

1092
01:36:08,703 --> 01:36:13,114
For his dogs, you understand.

1093
01:36:15,225 --> 01:36:19,157
I said to him, I--
I don't know how I say this.

1094
01:36:19,252 --> 01:36:22,610
I never could say it now--
I said to him,

1095
01:36:22,705 --> 01:36:25,007
"Why are you beating me?"

1096
01:36:28,075 --> 01:36:31,625
He said, "The reason
I beat you now..."

1097
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:35,461
is because you ask
why I beat you."

1098
01:36:37,282 --> 01:36:40,065
I know your sufferings, Helen.

1099
01:36:42,462 --> 01:36:44,764
It doesn't matter.

1100
01:36:46,394 --> 01:36:49,271
I have accepted them.

1101
01:36:49,272 --> 01:36:51,477
Accepted them?

1102
01:36:53,204 --> 01:36:55,314
One day he will shoot me.

1103
01:36:55,409 --> 01:36:57,711
No, no, no, no,
he won't shoot you.

1104
01:36:57,807 --> 01:37:01,355
I know. I see things.

1105
01:37:01,451 --> 01:37:04,713
We were on the roof on Monday,
young Lisiek and I,

1106
01:37:04,808 --> 01:37:08,644
and we saw the Herr Kommandant
come out of the front door...

1107
01:37:08,645 --> 01:37:13,344
and down the steps by the patio
right there below us and--

1108
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:18,139
and there on the steps
he drew his gun and he...

1109
01:37:18,235 --> 01:37:21,016
shot a woman
who was passing by.

1110
01:37:22,455 --> 01:37:25,620
A woman carrying a bundle.
Through the throat.

1111
01:37:25,716 --> 01:37:29,168
Just-- Just a woman
on her way somewhere,
you know.

1112
01:37:29,264 --> 01:37:33,005
She was no fatter or thinner...

1113
01:37:33,101 --> 01:37:35,402
or slower or faster
than anyone else,

1114
01:37:35,498 --> 01:37:39,047
and I couldn't guess
what had she done.

1115
01:37:43,650 --> 01:37:47,198
The more you see
of the Herr Kommandant,

1116
01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:51,993
the more you see
there is no set rules
that you can live by.

1117
01:37:51,994 --> 01:37:56,694
You can't say to yourself,
"If I follow these rules,
I will be safe."

1118
01:38:00,147 --> 01:38:04,269
He won't shoot you
because he enjoys you
too much.

1119
01:38:04,270 --> 01:38:08,203
He enjoys you so much
he won't even let you
wear the star.

1120
01:38:08,298 --> 01:38:10,600
He doesn't want
anyone else to know...

1121
01:38:10,696 --> 01:38:12,997
it's a Jew he's enjoying.

1122
01:38:16,259 --> 01:38:19,135
He shot the woman
from the steps...

1123
01:38:19,136 --> 01:38:22,780
because she meant
nothing to him.

1124
01:38:22,876 --> 01:38:25,177
She was one of a series,

1125
01:38:25,274 --> 01:38:27,863
neither offending
or pleasing him.

1126
01:38:31,603 --> 01:38:33,905
But you, Helen.

1127
01:38:38,221 --> 01:38:42,537
It's all right.
It's not that kind
of a kiss.

1128
01:38:46,661 --> 01:38:49,057
Thank you.

1129
01:38:49,058 --> 01:38:51,073
Shh.

1130
01:38:54,141 --> 01:38:55,964
Here.

1131
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:04,212
Right. The wine.

1132
01:39:11,022 --> 01:39:13,898
Wonderful party, Amon.
Thank you.

1133
01:39:22,050 --> 01:39:24,832
Why do you drink
that motor oil?

1134
01:39:24,928 --> 01:39:27,900
Hmm? I send you
good stuff all the time.

1135
01:39:27,901 --> 01:39:31,738
Your liver's
going to explode
like a hand grenade.

1136
01:39:31,833 --> 01:39:34,614
The more I look at you--

1137
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:36,916
I watch you.

1138
01:39:38,451 --> 01:39:40,464
You're never drunk.

1139
01:39:40,561 --> 01:39:44,397
Oh, that's--

1140
01:39:44,493 --> 01:39:47,465
that's real control.

1141
01:39:47,466 --> 01:39:49,576
Control is power.

1142
01:39:50,534 --> 01:39:52,741
That's power.

1143
01:39:56,385 --> 01:40:00,220
Is that why they fear us?

1144
01:40:00,221 --> 01:40:04,729
We have the fucking
power to kill, that's
why they fear us.

1145
01:40:04,824 --> 01:40:08,566
They fear us because
we have the power
to kill arbitrarily.

1146
01:40:08,661 --> 01:40:10,771
A man commits a crime,
he should know better.

1147
01:40:10,867 --> 01:40:13,360
We have him killed,
and feel good about it.

1148
01:40:13,457 --> 01:40:16,333
Or we kill him ourselves
and we feel even better.

1149
01:40:18,539 --> 01:40:21,513
That's not power, though.

1150
01:40:21,608 --> 01:40:25,637
That's justice.
It's different than power.

1151
01:40:28,226 --> 01:40:33,117
Power is when we have every
justification to kill...

1152
01:40:33,213 --> 01:40:35,707
and we don't.

1153
01:40:35,803 --> 01:40:37,912
You think that's power?

1154
01:40:40,502 --> 01:40:43,571
That's what the emperors had.
A man stole something,

1155
01:40:43,667 --> 01:40:45,202
he's brought in
before the emperor,

1156
01:40:45,297 --> 01:40:49,229
he throws himself
down on the ground,
he begs for mercy.

1157
01:40:49,326 --> 01:40:52,682
He knows he's going to die.

1158
01:40:54,504 --> 01:40:57,861
And the emperor... pardons him.

1159
01:40:59,108 --> 01:41:02,273
This worthless man.
He lets him go.

1160
01:41:05,246 --> 01:41:07,643
I think you are drunk.

1161
01:41:09,274 --> 01:41:12,151
That's power, Amon.

1162
01:41:12,247 --> 01:41:15,507
That... is power.

1163
01:41:22,893 --> 01:41:25,578
Amon the Good.

1164
01:41:28,456 --> 01:41:31,524
I pardon you.

1165
01:41:36,895 --> 01:41:39,293
What do they want?

1166
01:41:39,388 --> 01:41:42,649
I don't know,
but they're in my office now
reviewing our books.

1167
01:41:42,746 --> 01:41:45,814
As my accountant, tell me,
should I be alarmed...

1168
01:41:45,911 --> 01:41:48,692
that the auditors
are reviewing my books?
Well--

1169
01:41:48,787 --> 01:41:51,473
Or have you done
your job properly?
You needn't be alarmed.

1170
01:41:51,569 --> 01:41:53,486
I needn't be alarmed.

1171
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:58,474
I'm sorry, sir.

1172
01:41:58,570 --> 01:42:00,583
Do you know how much
this saddle is worth?

1173
01:42:00,584 --> 01:42:03,174
Do you know how much it costs?

1174
01:42:07,681 --> 01:42:11,230
All right.

1175
01:42:11,325 --> 01:42:13,243
All right.

1176
01:42:16,505 --> 01:42:19,477
Stern, what the hell are you
doing following me around?

1177
01:42:28,301 --> 01:42:31,562
Barracken eins, elf,

1178
01:42:31,657 --> 01:42:34,151
fuenfzehn und zwounddreissig...

1179
01:42:34,248 --> 01:42:36,837
am Appellplatz melden.

1180
01:43:03,402 --> 01:43:06,184
She was smoking on the job.

1181
01:43:09,733 --> 01:43:12,706
Tell her not to do it again.

1182
01:43:27,667 --> 01:43:30,449
I have to report, sir,

1183
01:43:30,544 --> 01:43:34,284
I've been unable to remove
the stains from your bathtub.

1184
01:43:38,313 --> 01:43:41,957
What are you using,
Lisiek?
Soap, Commandant.

1185
01:43:44,259 --> 01:43:46,561
Soap? Not lye?

1186
01:43:55,384 --> 01:43:59,220
Go ahead, go on, leave.
Leave, I pardon you.

1187
01:44:20,416 --> 01:44:22,525
I pardon you.

1188
01:46:09,749 --> 01:46:13,202
Although I am not a rabbi,
in these circumstances...

1189
01:46:13,297 --> 01:46:15,887
I pray to the Almighty
that you will forgive me...

1190
01:46:15,983 --> 01:46:18,956
if I intone the blessings.

1191
01:46:19,052 --> 01:46:21,736
Baruch ata Hsham eloiyni

# Bo milosc moj mily to ja #

1201
01:47:09,403 --> 01:47:11,703
So...

1202
01:47:11,704 --> 01:47:15,637
this is where you come
to hide from me.

1203
01:47:15,733 --> 01:47:18,898
I came to tell you...

1204
01:47:18,994 --> 01:47:22,829
that you, um, you really are
a wonderful cook...

1205
01:47:22,830 --> 01:47:25,804
and a well-trained servant.

1206
01:47:25,899 --> 01:47:30,118
I mean it.
If you need a reference
after the war,

1207
01:47:30,215 --> 01:47:34,819
I'd be-- I'd be happy
to give you one.

1208
01:47:34,914 --> 01:47:37,216
It must get lonely down here...

1209
01:47:37,312 --> 01:47:41,532
when you're listening
to everyone upstairs
having such a good time.

1210
01:47:48,437 --> 01:47:50,642
Does it?

1211
01:47:52,274 --> 01:47:54,191
You can answer.

1212
01:47:56,493 --> 01:48:00,713
But what's the right answer?
That's what you're thinking.

1213
01:48:00,809 --> 01:48:03,686
What does he want to hear?

1214
01:48:08,577 --> 01:48:12,606
The truth, Helen,
is always the right answer.

1215
01:48:15,195 --> 01:48:17,687
Y-Yes, you're right.

1216
01:48:17,688 --> 01:48:21,046
Sometimes we're both lonely.

1217
01:48:21,141 --> 01:48:24,017
Yes. I--

1218
01:48:24,018 --> 01:48:27,470
I mean--

1219
01:48:34,088 --> 01:48:37,349
I would like so much to...

1220
01:48:37,445 --> 01:48:41,185
reach out and touch you
in your loneliness.

1221
01:48:41,282 --> 01:48:44,543
Wh-What would that be like,
I wonder? I mean...

1222
01:48:44,638 --> 01:48:48,187
what would be wrong with that?

1223
01:48:48,283 --> 01:48:52,407
I realize that you're not
a-a person in the--

1224
01:48:52,502 --> 01:48:55,282
the strictest sense
of the word, but--

1225
01:48:55,283 --> 01:48:58,640
No, maybe you're right
about that too, you know.

1226
01:48:58,641 --> 01:49:03,435
Maybe what's--
what's wrong isn't--

1227
01:49:03,436 --> 01:49:05,930
It's not us.

1228
01:49:06,025 --> 01:49:08,327
It's no-- It's this.

1229
01:49:10,724 --> 01:49:14,847
I mean, when they
compare you to--

1230
01:49:14,848 --> 01:49:18,014
to, uh, vermin
and to rodents and to lice...

1231
01:49:20,028 --> 01:49:22,904
I just, uh--

1232
01:49:26,262 --> 01:49:29,043
N-No, you-you make
a good point.

1233
01:49:29,138 --> 01:49:31,440
You make a very good point.

1234
01:49:39,496 --> 01:49:41,798
Is this the face of a rat?

1235
01:49:44,868 --> 01:49:46,977
Are these the eyes of a rat?

1236
01:49:47,073 --> 01:49:49,854
# Milosc... #

1237
01:49:49,951 --> 01:49:52,443
Hath not a Jew eyes?

1238
01:49:52,444 --> 01:49:58,101
# Ci wszystko wybaczy #

1239
01:49:58,102 --> 01:50:04,625
# Bo milosc moj mily #

1240
01:50:07,693 --> 01:50:11,241
I feel for you, Helen.

1241
01:50:13,927 --> 01:50:18,627
# # Toja ### #

1242
01:50:27,354 --> 01:50:30,039
No, I don't think so.

1243
01:50:31,957 --> 01:50:34,739
You're a Jewish bitch.

1244
01:50:36,273 --> 01:50:40,205
You nearly talked me into it,
Helen, didn't you?

1245
01:50:45,288 --> 01:50:47,782
Bravo.

1246
01:51:02,743 --> 01:51:06,196
Hoch .! Hoch .! Hoch .!

1247
01:51:06,293 --> 01:51:08,690
# ###

1248
01:51:08,785 --> 01:51:12,430
- Jawohl.!
- Hoch.! Hoch.!

1249
01:51:12,526 --> 01:51:15,595
Hoch!

1250
01:51:20,678 --> 01:51:23,172
On behalf of the--
of the workers, sir,

1251
01:51:23,267 --> 01:51:26,337
I, I wish for you
a happy birthday.

1252
01:51:26,432 --> 01:51:28,350
Happy birthday.

1253
01:51:28,447 --> 01:51:30,652
Well, thank the staff, please.

1254
01:51:30,748 --> 01:51:33,434
Thank you very much
for the lovely cake.

1255
01:51:50,505 --> 01:51:55,109
Thank you very much.
Tell them thank you from me.

1256
01:52:02,686 --> 01:52:06,330
# # To ostatnia niedziela # #

1257
01:52:06,426 --> 01:52:09,686
# #Dzisiaj sie rozstaniemy # #

1258
01:52:09,783 --> 01:52:14,481
The trains arrived
and the people were
driven out with clubs.

1259
01:52:14,482 --> 01:52:18,798
They were lined up in front
of two big warehouses.

1260
01:52:18,893 --> 01:52:22,825
One was marked "Cloak Room,"
and the other "Valuables."

1261
01:52:22,922 --> 01:52:25,224
And there they
were made to undress.

1262
01:52:25,319 --> 01:52:29,635
AJewish boy handed them
pieces of string to tie
their shoes together.

1263
01:52:29,731 --> 01:52:32,320
They shaved their hair.

1264
01:52:32,416 --> 01:52:37,115
They told them it was needed
to make something special
for U-boat crews.

1265
01:52:37,212 --> 01:52:41,239
And then they were herded
down a big corridor...

1266
01:52:41,336 --> 01:52:45,268
to bunkers with
Stars of David on the doors,

1267
01:52:45,363 --> 01:52:49,104
and signs that said
"Bath and Inhalation Room."

1268
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:51,310
SS gave them soap.

1269
01:52:51,405 --> 01:52:56,297
They told them to
breathe all the time because
it's good for disinfecting.

1270
01:52:56,393 --> 01:52:59,079
And then they gassed them.

1271
01:53:00,325 --> 01:53:02,819
Mila, why soaps?

1272
01:53:02,914 --> 01:53:05,407
So that they would agree
to go in, I think.

1273
01:53:05,408 --> 01:53:09,051
Come on, Mila, stop it.
Your bedtime stories
are scaring everyone.

1274
01:53:09,052 --> 01:53:11,450
I just don't believe it.
Ja. You know
it's ridiculous.

1275
01:53:11,546 --> 01:53:13,464
I don't believe it
either.
I cannot believe it.

1276
01:53:13,561 --> 01:53:16,054
I didn't say I believed it.
I said I heard it.

1277
01:53:16,150 --> 01:53:19,314
From who?
From somebody who heard it
from someone who was there.

1278
01:53:19,315 --> 01:53:21,809
You know, if they were there,

1279
01:53:21,904 --> 01:53:24,109
they would have been gassed.

1280
01:53:24,110 --> 01:53:27,466
Yes.
It doesn't
make any sense.

1281
01:53:27,563 --> 01:53:29,481
We're their work force.

1282
01:53:29,576 --> 01:53:33,221
What sense does it make
to kill your own work force?

1283
01:53:33,317 --> 01:53:38,016
To go to all this trouble
of assembling a work force
only to--

1284
01:53:38,112 --> 01:53:41,276
No, it can't be true.

1285
01:53:41,277 --> 01:53:44,154
We are very, very
important for them.

1286
01:53:44,155 --> 01:53:47,415
Ja, we do now. Good night.

1287
01:53:47,511 --> 01:53:50,389
Good night.
Good night.
Sweet dreams.

1288
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:01,013
Attention, attention.

1289
01:54:01,109 --> 01:54:03,411
Everyone who is alive...

1290
01:54:03,507 --> 01:54:06,863
is to come to the Appellplatz.

1291
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:11,275
Attention, attention.
Come, we have to go
to the Appellplatz.

1292
01:54:11,276 --> 01:54:12,427
- Everyone who is alive...
- The listmakers are here.

1293
01:54:12,522 --> 01:54:15,400
Is to come to the Appellplatz.
There is going
to be a selection.

1294
01:54:15,495 --> 01:54:19,907
Attention, attention.
Everyone who is alive...

1295
01:54:20,003 --> 01:54:23,743
is to come to the Appellplatz.

1296
01:54:36,978 --> 01:54:38,896
Meine Herren.

1297
01:54:38,897 --> 01:54:40,814
Raz.! Dwa.!

1298
01:54:40,815 --> 01:54:43,020
Raz.! Dwa.!

1299
01:54:43,021 --> 01:54:45,131
...die Hunderttausend
Ungarn kommen...

1300
01:54:47,144 --> 01:54:50,885
Alle in einer
Einzelreihe aufstellen!

1301
01:54:50,981 --> 01:54:54,913
You could afford
to lose some weight, Amon.

1302
01:54:55,009 --> 01:54:57,502
And you've got to
cut down on the cognac.

1303
01:54:57,503 --> 01:55:00,379
Morning. What's going on?

1304
01:55:00,380 --> 01:55:03,257
It's another
semiannual physical.

1305
01:55:05,078 --> 01:55:09,681
There.
Oh, I've, um, got another
shipment coming in of, uh--

1306
01:55:09,682 --> 01:55:11,793
What are they this time?

1307
01:55:11,888 --> 01:55:13,710
Hungarians. Oh, ja, Hungarians.

1308
01:55:13,711 --> 01:55:17,258
We've got to separate
the sick from the healthy
to make room.

1309
01:55:17,259 --> 01:55:21,095
Teraz! Teraz!

Zack, zack, zack!

1317
01:56:03,870 --> 01:56:08,186
We've got to go out there.

1318
01:56:10,391 --> 01:56:12,979
Don't go.

1319
01:56:12,980 --> 01:56:14,995
Look alive, Rebeka.

1320
01:56:15,091 --> 01:56:17,295
Schneller!

Whose bright idea was it
to get rid of him?

1327

Ruszaj sie.! Naokolo.!

No, no, no.
Wait, go away.
She can work.

1338
01:57:46,298 --> 01:57:49,943
Come here. Look,
separate the sick
from the healthy.

1339
01:57:50,038 --> 01:57:52,436
Those who can work
and those who can't.
She can work.

1340
01:57:52,437 --> 01:57:56,560
You can work, you can come.

1341

Men, go back to the barracks.
Return to the barracks.

Go back to the barracks.

They're hiding.
I'm telling you, they're hiding.

1372
02:00:32,791 --> 02:00:36,243
I know Danka.
She took them to a good place.
She took all of them together.

02:01:03,195 --> 02:01:06,743
# ###

1379
02:01:25,636 --> 02:01:28,514
Get out. This is our place.
Get out!

1380
02:01:51,339 --> 02:01:54,505
Oskar! Amon. Gentlemen.

1381
02:01:54,600 --> 02:01:57,765
Why didn't you call me?
I tried to call you.
Here, Hujar, move.

1382
02:01:57,861 --> 02:02:00,546
Quite a picnic, huh?
Madritsch.
Oskar.

1383
02:02:00,642 --> 02:02:03,328
I'm running a little late.
This is taking longer
than I thought.

1384
02:02:03,423 --> 02:02:06,493
A drink?
Something cold.
Bowle.

1385
02:02:06,588 --> 02:02:08,698
The Bowle.

1386
02:02:10,328 --> 02:02:13,398
Oh, another beautiful day.

1387
02:02:16,083 --> 02:02:18,289
Cisza.! Spokoj.!

1388
02:02:25,961 --> 02:02:28,167
Die Beladung der Transportwagen
ist beendet.

1389
02:02:28,263 --> 02:02:30,661
Wir sind abfahrbereit.

1390
02:02:30,757 --> 02:02:33,153
Wody.! Wody.!

1391
02:02:33,154 --> 02:02:36,127
Wasser... wasser.

1392
02:02:42,170 --> 02:02:46,005
Wohlsein. Oh, thank you.

1393
02:02:51,569 --> 02:02:56,652
What do you say we get your
fire hoses out here and hose
down the cars? Thank you.

1394
02:02:58,665 --> 02:03:00,967
Indulge me.

1395
02:03:02,406 --> 02:03:04,516
Hujar. Yes, sir.

1396
02:03:04,612 --> 02:03:08,064
- Go bring the fire hoses.
- Where's the fire?

1397
02:03:11,517 --> 02:03:15,066
In the windows.
That's it, that's it.

1398
02:03:15,161 --> 02:03:19,093
On the roof.
That's it, good, good.
In the window, in the window.

1399
02:03:21,875 --> 02:03:25,614
Come on. Come on.

1400
02:03:25,615 --> 02:03:27,534
That's it, more, more.

1401
02:03:31,561 --> 02:03:35,302
That's it, that's it.
More, more.

1402
02:03:35,398 --> 02:03:38,849
This is really cruel, Oskar.
You are giving them hope.

1403
02:03:38,850 --> 02:03:42,590
You shouldn't do that.
That's cruel.!

1404
02:03:42,687 --> 02:03:46,043
Come on, try and
reach the far end.
Look out--

1405
02:03:46,140 --> 02:03:49,016
Water.! More water.!

1406
02:03:51,223 --> 02:03:54,963
I've got some 200-meter
hoses back at Emalia.

1407
02:03:55,058 --> 02:03:56,880
I have 20 meters
at home in my garden.

1408
02:03:56,977 --> 02:03:59,086
We can reach
the cars at the end.

1409
02:03:59,087 --> 02:04:01,484
What? What?

1410
02:04:01,581 --> 02:04:05,705
Huh?

1411
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:08,005
Hujar. Yeah, sure.

1412
02:04:25,844 --> 02:04:28,338
Don't forget the roof.

1413
02:04:28,434 --> 02:04:31,119
On the roof on the other side.

1414
02:04:31,216 --> 02:04:35,339
Water.!

1415
02:04:37,641 --> 02:04:40,038
Scharfuehrer,
every time the train stops,

1416
02:04:40,039 --> 02:04:42,435
you open the doors,
you give them water, ja?

1417
02:04:42,436 --> 02:04:45,314
Jawohl.
Ja. This car!
This car!

1418
02:05:08,811 --> 02:05:11,976
I'm not saying you'll
regret it, but you might.

1419
02:05:12,071 --> 02:05:16,675
You should be
aware of that.
We will have to risk regret.

1420
02:05:16,770 --> 02:05:20,415
All right, sure.
It's a nice day. I'll go
for a drive with you.

1421
02:05:53,982 --> 02:05:56,284
What about you?

1422
02:05:56,381 --> 02:06:00,408
I violated the
"Race and Resettlement Act."

1423
02:06:00,505 --> 02:06:04,340
Though I doubt
anyone can point out
the actual provision to me.

1424
02:06:04,437 --> 02:06:07,601
I kissed a Jewish girl.

1425
02:06:11,150 --> 02:06:13,931
Did your prick fall off?

1426
02:06:31,769 --> 02:06:34,743
He likes women.

1427
02:06:35,702 --> 02:06:38,771
He likes good-looking women.

1428
02:06:40,305 --> 02:06:44,429
He sees a beautiful woman,
he doesn't think.

1429
02:06:44,526 --> 02:06:47,210
I mean,

1430
02:06:47,307 --> 02:06:49,895
he has so many women.

1431
02:06:49,896 --> 02:06:52,005
And they love him.

1432
02:06:52,006 --> 02:06:54,978
Ja, they love him.
I mean, he is married,
ja, but he's--

1433
02:06:54,979 --> 02:06:59,967
All right, it's not--
She was Jewish.
He shouldn't have done it.

1434
02:07:00,062 --> 02:07:03,611
But, you didn't see this girl.

1435
02:07:03,707 --> 02:07:06,967
I saw this girl.
This girl was, woof--

1436
02:07:07,064 --> 02:07:09,174
She was very good-looking.

1437
02:07:12,434 --> 02:07:15,120
They cast a spell on you,
you know, theJews.

1438
02:07:15,215 --> 02:07:17,709
When you work closely with them,
like I do, you see this.

1439
02:07:17,805 --> 02:07:21,545
They have this power.
It's like a virus. Some of my men
are infected with this virus.

1440
02:07:21,546 --> 02:07:23,847
They should be
pitied, not punished.
They should receive treatment.

1441
02:07:23,848 --> 02:07:26,820
This is as real as typhus.
I see this all the time.

1442
02:07:26,821 --> 02:07:29,794
It's a matter of money? Hmm?

1443
02:07:29,889 --> 02:07:32,479
You're offering me a bribe?

1444
02:07:34,301 --> 02:07:39,096
A bribe? No. No, please.
It's a gratuity.

1445
02:07:39,192 --> 02:07:41,014
Heil Hitler.!

1446
02:07:45,235 --> 02:07:47,440
Hello, Amon.

1447
02:07:49,934 --> 02:07:51,851
Sit down.

1448
02:07:54,537 --> 02:07:58,085
We give you Jewish girls
at five marks a day, Oskar.

1449
02:07:58,182 --> 02:08:00,100
You should kiss us, not them.

1450
02:08:00,196 --> 02:08:04,128
God forbid you ever get
a real taste forJewish skirt.

1451
02:08:04,224 --> 02:08:07,484
There's no future in it.
They don't have a future.

1452
02:08:07,581 --> 02:08:12,279
That's not just good,
old-fashioned, Jew-hating talk.

1453
02:08:12,280 --> 02:08:15,061
It's policy now.

1454
02:08:16,297 --> 02:08:20,037
Ja, schoen gefangen! Gut!

1455
02:08:25,504 --> 02:08:29,532
Nochmal, ja! Schoen!

1456
02:08:58,304 --> 02:09:00,798
Also los! Bewegung!

1457
02:09:00,894 --> 02:09:04,634
Schneller hier.!
Zack, zack, zack.!

1458
02:09:04,730 --> 02:09:06,935
Beweg deinen Arsch!

1459
02:09:07,032 --> 02:09:09,526
Das geht auch schneller.!

1460
02:09:09,621 --> 02:09:12,497
Bewegt euch.!
Schlaft nicht ein.!

1461
02:09:12,498 --> 02:09:16,526
# ###
Nur die ganzen Fetzen,
nicht das Gemuese.!

1462
02:09:21,322 --> 02:09:23,240
Was ist denn hier los?

1463
02:09:23,336 --> 02:09:25,924
Komm, das kannst du mit
den Haenden machen,
fass da vorn an.!

1464
02:09:25,925 --> 02:09:27,459
Hier.!

1465
02:09:27,556 --> 02:09:30,240
Los, raus mit den Fetzen.!
Die Kleinteile lass liegen.!

1466
02:09:30,241 --> 02:09:33,598
# ###

1467
02:09:39,160 --> 02:09:42,805
Jetzt macht aber schnell,
verdammt noch mal.!
Weg mit den Scheissdingern.!

1468
02:09:51,148 --> 02:09:54,601
So ist es.! Walhalla.!
Walhalla laeuft hier.!

1469
02:09:56,615 --> 02:09:59,588
# ###

1470
02:09:59,684 --> 02:10:01,890
Can you believe this?

1471
02:10:01,985 --> 02:10:05,151
As if I don't have enough to do,
they come up with this?

1472
02:10:05,247 --> 02:10:09,082
I have to find every rag
buried up here and burn it.

1473
02:10:09,083 --> 02:10:13,686
The party's over, Oskar.
They're closing us down,
sending everybody to Auschwitz.

1474
02:10:13,783 --> 02:10:16,085
When?
I don't know. As soon as
I can arrange the shipments.

1475
02:10:16,180 --> 02:10:19,825
Maybe 30, 40 days.
That ought to be fun.

1476
02:10:21,934 --> 02:10:26,538
# ###

1477
02:10:39,198 --> 02:10:42,363
I've been talking to Goeth.
I know the destination.

1478
02:10:42,458 --> 02:10:45,239
These are
the evacuation orders.

1479
02:10:45,336 --> 02:10:48,021
I'm to help organize
the shipments, put myself
on the last train.

1480
02:10:48,022 --> 02:10:51,090
That's not what
I was going to say.

1481
02:10:51,186 --> 02:10:54,830
I made Goeth promise me
he'd put in a good word for you.

1482
02:10:54,927 --> 02:10:58,188
Nothing bad is going to happen
to you there. You'll receive
special treatment.

1483
02:10:58,283 --> 02:11:02,120
The directives coming in
from Berlin mention "Special Treatment"
more and more often.

1484
02:11:02,215 --> 02:11:05,860
I'd like to think
that's not what you mean.
Preferential treatment.

1485
02:11:05,955 --> 02:11:11,230
- Do we have to invent
a whole new language?
- I think so.

1486
02:11:12,573 --> 02:11:15,067
You're staying, I take it.

1487
02:11:18,903 --> 02:11:23,122
In Krakow? What on earth for?
What for?
You have a business to run.

1488
02:11:23,123 --> 02:11:26,768
Of course, you'll have
to hire new workers.
Poles, I guess.

1489
02:11:26,863 --> 02:11:30,412
They cost a little more, but--

1490
02:11:31,371 --> 02:11:33,673
What are you going to do?

1491
02:11:37,413 --> 02:11:40,386
You run my business.

1492
02:11:42,496 --> 02:11:44,798
No, I'm going home.

1493
02:11:44,894 --> 02:11:50,169
I've done what I came here for.
I've got more money than any man
could spend in a lifetime.

1494
02:12:00,527 --> 02:12:05,418
Someday, this is all
going to end, you know.

1495
02:12:09,253 --> 02:12:11,939
I was going to say
we'll have a drink then.

1496
02:12:15,968 --> 02:12:19,420
I think I better have it now.

1497
02:12:40,616 --> 02:12:43,299
# #Bible says # #

1498
02:12:43,300 --> 02:12:46,849
# #And it still is news # #

1499
02:12:46,945 --> 02:12:50,397
# #Mama may have # #

1500
02:12:50,398 --> 02:12:53,275
# #Papa may have # #

1501
02:12:53,371 --> 02:12:56,344
# #But God bless the child # #

1502
02:12:56,441 --> 02:12:59,222
# # That's got his own # #

1503
02:12:59,317 --> 02:13:02,098
# # That's got his own # #

1504
02:13:04,976 --> 02:13:09,962
# # Yes, the strong gets more # #

1505
02:13:10,059 --> 02:13:13,415
# # While the weak ones fade # #

1506
02:13:13,512 --> 02:13:16,580
# #Empty pockets don't # #

1507
02:13:16,676 --> 02:13:20,320
# #Ever make the grade # #

1508
02:13:20,417 --> 02:13:23,678
# #Mama may have # #

1509
02:13:23,773 --> 02:13:26,938
# #Papa may have # #

1510
02:13:27,034 --> 02:13:30,007
# #But God bless the child # #

1511
02:13:30,103 --> 02:13:32,788
# # That's got his own # #

1512
02:13:32,885 --> 02:13:35,474
# # That's got his own # #

1513
02:13:40,365 --> 02:13:43,625
# #Money # #

1514
02:13:43,626 --> 02:13:48,038
# # You've got lots of friends # #

1515
02:13:48,133 --> 02:13:50,723
# # They're pounding on your--### #

1516
02:13:50,819 --> 02:13:54,847
I don't understand.
I mean, you want these people?

1517
02:13:54,943 --> 02:13:57,437
"These people"?
My people,
I want my people.

1518
02:13:57,532 --> 02:14:00,410
Who are you, Moses?
Come on, what is this?

1519
02:14:00,506 --> 02:14:03,287
Where's the money in this?
Where's the scam?
It's good business.

1520
02:14:03,382 --> 02:14:05,589
It's good business
in your opinion.

1521
02:14:05,684 --> 02:14:09,617
You've got to move them,
the equipment, everything
to Czechoslovakia.

1522
02:14:09,713 --> 02:14:12,781
Pay for all that
and build another camp.
Doesn't make any sense.

1523
02:14:12,878 --> 02:14:15,946
Look, Amon--
It's good for me.
You're not telling me something.

1524
02:14:16,042 --> 02:14:18,728
I know them.
I'm familiar with them.
I don't have to train them.

1525
02:14:18,824 --> 02:14:20,550
You're not telling me something.
It's good for you.
I'll compensate you.

1526
02:14:20,551 --> 02:14:23,331
That's right.
It's good for the Army.

1527
02:14:23,428 --> 02:14:25,825
You know what
I'm going to make?
What?

1528
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:28,127
Artillery shells. Everyone is!

1529
02:14:28,222 --> 02:14:30,044
Tank shells,
they need that.
Tanks shells, ja.

1530
02:14:30,141 --> 02:14:32,538
Everybody's happy. Except me.

1531
02:14:32,635 --> 02:14:35,511
You're probably
scamming me somehow.

1532
02:14:35,607 --> 02:14:38,485
If I'm making 100,
you've got to be making 300.

1533
02:14:38,580 --> 02:14:41,841
If you admit to 300,
then it's 400 actually.
But how?

1534
02:14:41,842 --> 02:14:45,485
I just told you.
You did, but you didn't.

1535
02:14:46,733 --> 02:14:49,608
Ah, ja, all right,
don't tell me.

1536
02:14:49,609 --> 02:14:53,733
I'll go along with it.
It's just irritating
I can't work it out.

1537
02:14:53,830 --> 02:14:58,337
Look, all you have
to do is tell me
what it's worth to you.

1538
02:14:58,434 --> 02:15:01,023
What's a person
worth to you?
No, no, no, no.

1539
02:15:01,118 --> 02:15:03,996
What's one worth to you?

1540
02:15:11,573 --> 02:15:15,025
Poldek Pfefferberg.
Mila Pfefferberg.

1541
02:15:15,121 --> 02:15:18,380
And, uh--

1542
02:15:18,381 --> 02:15:20,300
Uh, Stagel, Stagel--

1543
02:15:20,396 --> 02:15:22,312
Paul. Paul Stagel.

1544
02:15:22,313 --> 02:15:24,903
Doctor.

1545
02:15:24,904 --> 02:15:29,698
The investors.
I want all of them.
Yes, sir.

1546
02:15:29,699 --> 02:15:32,288
Uh, Fischer. Ismail Fischer.

1547
02:15:32,384 --> 02:15:35,454
Fischer, Ismail.

1548
02:15:35,549 --> 02:15:38,426
Josef Scharf.
One moment, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.

1549
02:15:38,522 --> 02:15:40,440
Come on, Stern. Scharf, Scharf.

1550
02:15:43,413 --> 02:15:47,345
The children. All the children.

1551
02:15:51,469 --> 02:15:53,292
- Herbert Stier.
- Thank you.

1552
02:15:53,387 --> 02:15:57,416
How many? Four hundred, 450.

1553
02:15:59,909 --> 02:16:01,827
More, more.

1554
02:16:06,910 --> 02:16:09,404
Good morning.

1555
02:16:24,749 --> 02:16:29,928
Think of Feigenbaum, Jakob.
Wolf. Wolf Wein.

1556
02:16:33,956 --> 02:16:37,791
Lutek, Jakob,
Nacha. Yes? Nacha.

1557
02:16:37,792 --> 02:16:39,710
Nacha, that's right.

1558
02:16:39,711 --> 02:16:42,300
And Wolf.

1559
02:16:42,395 --> 02:16:44,794
How many?

1560
02:16:46,327 --> 02:16:49,588
Six hundred. More.

1561
02:16:49,589 --> 02:16:52,273
You can do
the same thing I'm doing.

1562
02:16:52,274 --> 02:16:54,959
- You might even make money at it.
- I don't know.

1563
02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:57,645
Come on, Julius, I know
about the extra food
and clothes you give them.

1564
02:16:57,741 --> 02:17:00,714
Paid for out of your own pocket.
If we make a combined approach,

1565
02:17:00,809 --> 02:17:03,208
we could get more than
4,000 out, mine and yours.
Oskar--

1566
02:17:03,209 --> 02:17:06,468
We could relocate them
in something like safety,
in Moravia.

1567
02:17:06,564 --> 02:17:08,962
I don't know.

1568
02:17:11,072 --> 02:17:14,812
How many cigarettes
have you smoked tonight?
Too many.

1569
02:17:14,908 --> 02:17:19,320
For every one--
you smoke, I smoke half.

1570
02:17:19,415 --> 02:17:21,908
I've done all I can.
I will not accept that.

1571
02:17:21,909 --> 02:17:25,074
No, Oskar,
I can't do anymore.
I will not accept that.

1572
02:17:25,170 --> 02:17:26,800
No.

1573
02:17:36,391 --> 02:17:38,980
How many? How many?
Eight hundred and fifty,
give or take.

1574
02:17:39,077 --> 02:17:42,817
Give or take what, Stern?
Count them. How many?

1575
02:17:52,983 --> 02:17:56,435
That's it.
You can finish that page.

1576
02:18:01,039 --> 02:18:04,778
What... did... Goeth...
say about this?

1577
02:18:04,779 --> 02:18:08,520
You just told him how
many people you needed and--

1578
02:18:11,493 --> 02:18:13,699
You're not buying them.

1579
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,974
You're buying them?
You're paying him
for each of these names?

1580
02:18:19,069 --> 02:18:22,331
If you were still working
for me, I'd expect you
to talk me out of it.

1581
02:18:22,426 --> 02:18:25,686
It's costing me a fortune.

1582
02:18:25,687 --> 02:18:29,619
Finish the page and leave
one space at the bottom.

1583
02:18:50,814 --> 02:18:52,925
Look.

1584
02:18:58,295 --> 02:19:02,323
The list is an absolute good.

1585
02:19:02,420 --> 02:19:05,105
The list... is life.

1586
02:19:06,639 --> 02:19:11,819
All around its margins
lies the gulf.

1587
02:19:11,914 --> 02:19:15,654
Oskar, there's
a clerical error here
at the bottom of the last page.

1588
02:19:15,751 --> 02:19:18,340
No, there's one more name
I want to put there.

1589
02:19:18,435 --> 02:19:22,751
I'll never fid a maid as well
trained as her at Brinnlitz.
They are all country girls.

1590
02:19:22,848 --> 02:19:24,766
No.

1591
02:19:34,068 --> 02:19:35,890
No.

1592
02:19:35,987 --> 02:19:37,999
One hand of 21. No.

1593
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,878
If you win, I pay you
7,400 Reichsmark.
No.

1594
02:19:40,973 --> 02:19:44,235
Hit a natural,
I make it 14,800.
No.

1595
02:19:44,331 --> 02:19:47,112
If I win,
the girl goes on my list.

1596
02:19:47,207 --> 02:19:50,948
I can't wager Helen
in a card game.
Why not?

1597
02:19:51,044 --> 02:19:53,922
Wouldn't be right.
She's just going to Auschwitz
on Number Two anyway.

1598
02:19:54,017 --> 02:19:56,511
What difference
does it make?
She's not going to Auschwitz.

1599
02:19:56,606 --> 02:20:00,251
I'd never do that to her.
No, I want her to come back
to Vienna with me.

1600
02:20:00,347 --> 02:20:03,224
I want her to come
to work for me there.

1601
02:20:03,319 --> 02:20:07,636
I want to grow old
with her.
Are you mad?

1602
02:20:07,732 --> 02:20:13,101
Amon, you can't take her
to Vienna with you.
No, of course I can't.

1603
02:20:13,102 --> 02:20:16,650
That's what I'd like to do.

1604
02:20:16,651 --> 02:20:21,830
What I can do, if I'm
any sort of a man, is the
next most merciful thing.

1605
02:20:21,925 --> 02:20:26,529
I should take her into the woods
and shoot her painlessly
in the back of the head.

1606
02:20:36,025 --> 02:20:39,477
What was it you said
for a natural 21?

1607
02:20:39,573 --> 02:20:42,738
Was it 14,800?

1608
02:20:42,833 --> 02:20:45,040
Schindlerjuden to these tables.!
Say your names clearly.

1609
02:20:45,998 --> 02:20:49,450
We are the family Dresner.
Juda, Jonas,

1610
02:20:49,451 --> 02:20:51,753
Donata and Chaja.

1611
02:20:51,848 --> 02:20:55,301
We are Rosners.
Henry, Manci--
And Leo.

1612
02:20:55,398 --> 02:20:57,412
And our son. I am Olek.

1613
02:20:58,274 --> 02:21:00,096
Maria Mischel.

1614
02:21:00,193 --> 02:21:02,877
Chaim Nowak.

1615
02:21:02,878 --> 02:21:05,084
Wulkan, Markus.

1616
02:21:05,179 --> 02:21:07,002
Michael Lemper.

1617
02:21:08,537 --> 02:21:10,454
Itzhak Stern.

1618
02:21:10,551 --> 02:21:13,906
Rebeka and Josef Bau.

1619
02:21:13,907 --> 02:21:16,592
Rosalia Nussbaum.
Wilhelm Nussbaum.

1620
02:21:16,593 --> 02:21:19,278
Jakob Levartov.

1621
02:21:19,374 --> 02:21:22,059
Farber, Rosa. Farber, Arje.

1622
02:21:22,060 --> 02:21:25,224
...Sara. Friehof, Fischel.

1623
02:21:25,320 --> 02:21:27,910
Mietek Pemper.

1624
02:21:28,005 --> 02:21:30,690
Poldek and Mila Pfefferberg.

1625
02:21:30,691 --> 02:21:33,375
Horowitz, Dolek.

1626
02:21:33,376 --> 02:21:35,774
Adam Levy.

1627
02:21:35,870 --> 02:21:38,172
Marcel Goldberg.

1628
02:21:38,267 --> 02:21:41,240
Klipstein, Isak David.

1629
02:21:41,241 --> 02:21:43,541
Altmann, Eduard.

1630
02:21:43,542 --> 02:21:45,557
Grunberg, Miriam.

1631
02:21:45,652 --> 02:21:47,666
Luftig, Eliasz.

1632
02:21:47,762 --> 02:21:49,681
Hilmann, Eduard.

1633
02:21:49,776 --> 02:21:51,693
Erna Rothberg.

1634
02:21:51,694 --> 02:21:54,476
Zuckermann, Jetti.

1635
02:21:54,572 --> 02:21:56,778
Helen Hirsch.

1636
02:21:58,888 --> 02:22:02,628
The worst is over.

1637
02:22:02,723 --> 02:22:06,464
Men to this transport
and women to this transport.

1638
02:22:06,560 --> 02:22:11,259
Be careful.
Men to this transport and
women to this transport.

1639
02:22:11,355 --> 02:22:15,479
Watch your step.
Men to this transport
and women to this transport.

1640
02:22:52,308 --> 02:22:56,334
Wonderful, Olek, wonderful.

1641
02:22:56,335 --> 02:23:00,556
You know how we make
ice into water?

1642
02:23:00,651 --> 02:23:03,816
Olek, get another one!

1643
02:23:40,548 --> 02:23:43,234
Alle in eine Einzelreihe
aufstellen!

1644
02:23:43,330 --> 02:23:48,413
You'll be pleased with
the level of efficiency
I get from these workers.

1645
02:23:50,043 --> 02:23:52,344
Budzyn, under my command,

1646
02:23:52,345 --> 02:23:55,414
was the envy
of every other commandant
in the labor camp system.

1647
02:23:55,509 --> 02:23:56,469
The prisoners,
however--
Excuse me.

1648
02:23:56,565 --> 02:23:59,250
They would have rather
been somewhere else.

1649
02:24:12,772 --> 02:24:16,609
The train with the women
has already left Plaszow...

1650
02:24:16,706 --> 02:24:20,062
and will be arriving
here very shortly.

1651
02:24:20,158 --> 02:24:22,746
I know you've had
a long journey.

1652
02:24:22,747 --> 02:24:25,913
But it's only a short walk
further to the factory...

1653
02:24:26,008 --> 02:24:31,186
where hot soup and bread
is waiting for you.

1654
02:24:31,283 --> 02:24:33,297
Welcome to Brinnlitz!

1655
02:24:42,504 --> 02:24:45,956
- Beans in tsunt?
- Beans are the best.

1656
02:24:45,957 --> 02:24:47,970
I don't like beans.

1657
02:24:48,067 --> 02:24:51,806
Beans and meat
and potatoes and bread.

1658
02:24:51,807 --> 02:24:53,917
That's not the way
you make tsunt.

1659
02:24:57,466 --> 02:25:00,726
Eggs in tsunt? Yes!

1660
02:25:03,316 --> 02:25:06,096
- I don't like tsunt.
- No, you don't.

1661
02:25:06,097 --> 02:25:11,084
What do you like?
I like caviar.

1662
02:25:11,180 --> 02:25:13,578
One day on the fire.

1663
02:26:16,684 --> 02:26:18,986
Alle vorm Wagen
in Position bleiben.

1664
02:26:20,424 --> 02:26:23,684
Alle in der Gruppe
zusammenbleiben.

1665
02:26:23,685 --> 02:26:27,809
Wegbleiben vom Wagen.!
Wegbleiben vom Wagen.!

1666
02:26:27,906 --> 02:26:30,207
Wegbleiben vom Wagen,
hab ich gesagt.!

1667
02:26:32,317 --> 02:26:34,619
Bagaze zostawic!

1668
02:26:36,057 --> 02:26:38,838
Schneller.!
Dalli, dalli, dalli.!

1669
02:26:38,935 --> 02:26:41,045
Was ist da hinten los.!

1670
02:26:43,538 --> 02:26:45,456
Schnell.!

1671
02:26:49,964 --> 02:26:54,087
Los, 'raus mit euch.
Zack, zack, zack! 'Raus!

1672
02:26:54,184 --> 02:26:59,746
Dreissig, fuenfunddreissig,
vierzig, fuenfundvierzig.

1673
02:26:59,842 --> 02:27:01,664
Aussteigen.!

1674
02:27:01,761 --> 02:27:04,062
'Rausgehen! 'Rausgehen!

1675
02:27:04,158 --> 02:27:06,939
Schneller! 'Rausgehen!

1676
02:27:10,104 --> 02:27:12,789
Alle 'raus!

1677
02:27:12,790 --> 02:27:16,434
Where are the listmakers?
Where are the tables?

1678
02:27:19,216 --> 02:27:21,900
Move the line.!

1679
02:27:21,997 --> 02:27:24,299
'Raus mit euch!

1680
02:27:24,394 --> 02:27:26,696
Hopp, hopp.!

Schneller.!

1685
02:27:36,958 --> 02:27:38,781
Los, ein bisschen schneller!

1686
02:27:38,876 --> 02:27:41,657
Mama, where are we?

1687
02:27:42,329 --> 02:27:45,877
Seventeen, 18, 20--
They're in Auschwitz.

1688
02:27:45,973 --> 02:27:49,138
The train was
never routed here.
Apaperwork mistake.

1689
02:27:56,139 --> 02:27:57,674
Szybciej! Szybko!

1690
02:27:57,769 --> 02:28:00,071

02:28:57,232 --> 02:28:59,053

Blick hinunter.!

1708
02:31:36,341 --> 02:31:39,027
Die Hand auf die Schulter.!

1709
02:31:39,122 --> 02:31:42,000
How old are you, Mother?
Sixty-eight.

1710
02:31:42,095 --> 02:31:46,986
Cough for me, Mother.
They say to fall against
the fence is a kindness.

1711
02:31:47,083 --> 02:31:50,056
Don't kill yourself
against the fence, Clara.

1712
02:31:50,151 --> 02:31:53,891
If you do, you'll never
know what happened to you.

1713
02:31:53,988 --> 02:31:58,111
How old are you,
Mother?
Sixty-six, sir.

1714
02:31:58,112 --> 02:32:00,316
Sir? Good morning.

1715
02:32:00,317 --> 02:32:03,195
A mistake has been made.
We are not supposed
to be here.

1716
02:32:03,290 --> 02:32:06,838
We work for Oskar Schindler.
We are SchindlerJews.

1717
02:32:06,935 --> 02:32:10,291
Who is Oskar Schindler?
He had a factory
in Krakow.

1718
02:32:10,388 --> 02:32:14,606
Enamelware. A potmaker.

1719
02:32:14,607 --> 02:32:16,717
How old are you, Mother?

1720
02:32:21,130 --> 02:32:25,444
You are not
the only industrialist
who needs labor,

1721
02:32:25,541 --> 02:32:29,089
Herr Schindler.

1722
02:32:29,186 --> 02:32:31,967
I remember
earlier this year,
I.G. Farben ordered...

1723
02:32:32,062 --> 02:32:37,625
a trainload of Hungarians
for his chemical factory.

1724
02:32:37,721 --> 02:32:41,461
The train came in
through the archway,

1725
02:32:41,557 --> 02:32:46,544
and the officer in charge
of the selection went
immediately to work...

1726
02:32:46,640 --> 02:32:49,997
and sent 2,000 of them...

1727
02:32:50,092 --> 02:32:53,066
straightaway
to Special Treatment.

1728
02:32:53,162 --> 02:32:58,148
It is not my task
to interfere with the processes
that take place down here.

1729
02:32:59,875 --> 02:33:05,149
Why do you think I can
help you if I can't
help I.G. Farben?

1730
02:33:05,150 --> 02:33:07,452
Allow me to express the reason.

1731
02:33:16,467 --> 02:33:19,632
I'm not making
any judgment about you.

1732
02:33:19,728 --> 02:33:23,277
It's just that I know
that in the coming months...

1733
02:33:23,372 --> 02:33:27,401
we're all going
to need portable wealth.

1734
02:33:28,455 --> 02:33:31,045
I could have you arrested.

1735
02:33:31,141 --> 02:33:35,457
I'm protected
by powerful friends.
You should know that.

1736
02:33:38,526 --> 02:33:42,362
I do not say
I am accepting them.

1737
02:33:42,458 --> 02:33:47,061
All I say is,
I'm not comfortable
with them on the table.

1738
02:34:00,392 --> 02:34:03,558
I have a shipment
coming in tomorrow.

1739
02:34:03,653 --> 02:34:05,954
I'll cut you 300 units from it.

1740
02:34:05,955 --> 02:34:09,791
New ones. These are fresh.

1741
02:34:13,340 --> 02:34:16,599
The train comes,
we turn it around.
Mmm, yes, yes.

1742
02:34:16,600 --> 02:34:18,806
It's yours. I understand.

1743
02:34:18,902 --> 02:34:21,396
I want these.

1744
02:34:23,697 --> 02:34:26,479
You shouldn't
get stuck on names.

1745
02:34:33,960 --> 02:34:38,084
That's right. It creates
a lot of paperwork.

1746
02:34:38,563 --> 02:34:42,208
Zoldinger, Ernestina.!
Waldergrun, Hilda.!

1747
02:34:42,303 --> 02:34:44,413
Waldergrun, Leonora.!

1748
02:34:44,510 --> 02:34:47,770
Laast, Anna! Pfefferberg, Mila!

1749
02:34:47,866 --> 02:34:51,223
Dresner, Chaja! Dresner, Danka!

1750
02:34:51,318 --> 02:34:54,868
Nussbaum, Sidonia!
Rosner, Manci!

1751
02:34:54,963 --> 02:34:59,950
Hirsch, Helen.!
Grosz, Chaja Sara.!
Seelenfreund, Estella.!

1752
02:35:12,898 --> 02:35:17,022
Schneller laufen.!
Schneller laufen.! Schneller.!

1753
02:35:17,117 --> 02:35:21,049
Schneller.!
Schneller.!
Mach schon.! Voran.!

1754
02:35:23,064 --> 02:35:25,845
Los, los, los.! Schneller.!

1755
02:35:27,572 --> 02:35:31,504
- Schneller!
- Bewegt euch!

1756
02:35:31,599 --> 02:35:34,572
Bojcie sie! Bojcie sie!

1757
02:35:38,312 --> 02:35:42,437
No! No! No!

1758
02:35:46,753 --> 02:35:50,493
Maedchen, los jetzt aber!
Jetzt aber Tempo!

1759
02:35:56,247 --> 02:35:59,796
No! No! No!

1760
02:35:59,892 --> 02:36:03,249
Danka! Danka! Danka!

1761
02:36:03,344 --> 02:36:05,551
No! No! No!

1762
02:36:07,565 --> 02:36:10,921
Hey.! Hey.! Hey.!
What are you doing?

1763
02:36:11,018 --> 02:36:16,100
These are mine!
These are my workers!
They should be on my train!

1764
02:36:16,101 --> 02:36:18,689
They're skilled
munitions workers!
They're essential!

1765
02:36:18,690 --> 02:36:22,430
Essential girls!

1766
02:36:22,526 --> 02:36:27,609
Their fingers polish the insides
of shell metal casings.

1767
02:36:27,705 --> 02:36:31,445
How else am I
to polish the inside of
a .45 millimeter shell casing?

1768
02:36:31,541 --> 02:36:35,186
You tell me. You tell me!

1769
02:36:35,281 --> 02:36:39,885
Back on the train!
Back on the train!

1770
02:38:30,082 --> 02:38:34,300
Under Department "W"
provisions,

1771
02:38:34,301 --> 02:38:38,521
it is unlawful to kill
a worker without just cause.

1772
02:38:38,617 --> 02:38:41,494
Under the Businesses
Compensation Fund,

1773
02:38:41,591 --> 02:38:45,715
I am entitled to file
damage claims for such deaths.

1774
02:38:45,810 --> 02:38:48,591
If you shoot without thinking,

1775
02:38:48,688 --> 02:38:52,236
you go to prison, I get paid.

1776
02:38:52,331 --> 02:38:54,921
That's how it works.

1777
02:38:54,922 --> 02:38:59,141
So, there will be no
summary executions here.

1778
02:39:00,868 --> 02:39:05,472
There will be no
interference of any kind
with production.

1779
02:39:05,567 --> 02:39:10,362
In hopes of ensuring that,
guards will no longer be
allowed on the factory floor...

1780
02:39:10,458 --> 02:39:13,815
without my authorization.

1781
02:39:18,611 --> 02:39:22,638
For your cooperation,
you have my gratitude.

1782
02:39:23,694 --> 02:39:25,899
Come on, come.

1783
02:39:25,995 --> 02:39:28,297
Mensch, seitJahren hab' ich
so etwas nicht mehr gesehen.

1784
02:39:28,393 --> 02:39:31,942
Come on, boys, come.
Guck dir mal die Buddeln an!

1785
02:39:32,325 --> 02:39:36,736
Et dimitte nobis debita nostra,

1786
02:39:36,833 --> 02:39:40,573
sicut et nos dimittimus...

1787
02:39:40,669 --> 02:39:45,080
...quotidianum da nobis hodie,

1788
02:39:45,081 --> 02:39:49,587
et dimitte nobis
debita nostra...

1789
02:39:49,588 --> 02:39:52,945
sicut et nos dimittimus...

1790
02:39:53,040 --> 02:39:55,822
debitoribus nostris--

1791
02:39:55,918 --> 02:40:01,097
No doorman or maitre d'
will ever mistake you again.

1792
02:40:01,193 --> 02:40:03,590
I promise.

1793
02:40:03,687 --> 02:40:05,797
...sed libera nos a malo.

1794
02:40:07,427 --> 02:40:10,304
Itzhak.

1795
02:40:10,400 --> 02:40:14,045
This is Itzhak Stern,
my accountant. Itzhak--
You must be Mrs. Schindler.

1796
02:40:14,140 --> 02:40:16,537
It's a pleasure.
Emilie has volunteered
to work in the clinic.

1797
02:40:16,634 --> 02:40:18,456
Very generous of you. I know.

1798
02:40:18,552 --> 02:40:21,140
We need to talk
when you have a moment.

1799
02:40:21,141 --> 02:40:23,635
This is my wife, Stern.
I don't keep any secrets
from my spouse.

1800
02:40:23,731 --> 02:40:26,704
Oskar, please, attend
to business. It's much
more attractive.

1801
02:40:26,800 --> 02:40:28,622
Madam. Hello.

1802
02:40:28,718 --> 02:40:31,211
What is it?
We received an angry complaint
from the Armaments Board.

1803
02:40:31,308 --> 02:40:33,418
The artillery shells,
tank shells, rocket casings--

1804
02:40:33,419 --> 02:40:36,774
Apparently all of them have
failed quality control tests.
That's to be expected.

1805
02:40:36,870 --> 02:40:40,225
Start-up problems.
This isn't pots and pans.
This is a precise business.

1806
02:40:40,226 --> 02:40:41,761
I'll write them
a letter.
They're withholding payment.

1807
02:40:41,857 --> 02:40:45,884
Sure, so would I, so would you.
I wouldn't worry. We'll get it
right one of these days.

1808
02:40:45,885 --> 02:40:49,817
There's a rumor
you've been going around
miscalibrating the machines.

1809
02:40:50,489 --> 02:40:54,900
They could shut us down,
send us back to Auschwitz.

1810
02:40:55,572 --> 02:40:58,450
I'll call around, find out
where we can buy shells.

1811
02:40:58,545 --> 02:41:01,422
Pass them off as ours.
I don't see the difference
whether they're made here--

1812
02:41:01,518 --> 02:41:04,299
You don't see a difference?
I see a difference.
You lose a lot of money.

1813
02:41:04,395 --> 02:41:07,560
Fewer shells will be made.
Stern, if this factory
ever produces...

1814
02:41:07,657 --> 02:41:12,834
a shell that can
actually be fired,
I'll be very unhappy.

1815
02:41:12,835 --> 02:41:15,713
Hello, madam. How do you do?

1816
02:41:28,660 --> 02:41:32,976
How are you doing,
Rabbi? Rabbi!

1817
02:41:35,086 --> 02:41:36,908
Good, Herr Direktor.

1818
02:41:38,634 --> 02:41:41,032
Sun's going down.

1819
02:41:43,045 --> 02:41:45,539
Yes, it is.

1820
02:41:45,635 --> 02:41:49,184
What day is this?
Friday?
It is Friday, isn't it?

1821
02:41:49,279 --> 02:41:51,293
Is it?

1822
02:41:55,417 --> 02:42:00,307
What's the matter with you?
You should be preparing
for the Sabbath.

1823
02:42:00,308 --> 02:42:03,378
Shouldn't you?

1824
02:42:08,844 --> 02:42:13,447
I've got some wine.
In my office. Come.

1825
02:42:16,709 --> 02:42:20,545
Savree maranun
verbanun verabuty...

1826
02:42:22,175 --> 02:42:28,984
Baruch ata adoshem,

1839
02:43:25,378 --> 02:43:28,350
What?

1840
02:43:28,351 --> 02:43:33,146
Do you have any money,
uh, hidden away someplace...

1841
02:43:33,147 --> 02:43:35,831
that I don't know about?

1842
02:43:39,093 --> 02:43:41,490
No.

1843
02:43:45,710 --> 02:43:49,451
Why? Am I broke?

1844
02:43:49,546 --> 02:43:52,327
Uh--

1845
02:43:52,423 --> 02:43:55,205
Well--

1846
02:43:55,301 --> 02:44:00,768
Yesterday morning, at 241 a.m.,

1847
02:44:00,863 --> 02:44:05,275
at General Eisenhower's
headquarters,

1848
02:44:05,371 --> 02:44:07,960
General Jodl...

1849
02:44:08,056 --> 02:44:11,507
signed the "Act of
Unconditional Surrender"...

1850
02:44:11,508 --> 02:44:14,002
of all German land,

1851
02:44:14,099 --> 02:44:17,839
sea and air forces in Europe...

1852
02:44:17,934 --> 02:44:21,770
to the Allied
Expeditionary Force,

1853
02:44:21,771 --> 02:44:25,895
and simultaneously
to the Soviet High Command.

1854
02:44:25,990 --> 02:44:30,211
The German war is,
therefore, at an end.

1855
02:44:30,306 --> 02:44:32,224
But let us not forget
for a moment--

1856
02:44:32,225 --> 02:44:36,348
I think it's time the guards
came into the factory.

1857
02:44:36,445 --> 02:44:39,512
Japan, with all
her treachery and greed--

1858
02:44:39,513 --> 02:44:44,788
The unconditional surrender of
Germany has just been announced.

1859
02:44:44,884 --> 02:44:48,720
At midnight tonight,
the war is over.

1860
02:44:50,735 --> 02:44:53,421
Tomorrow you'll
begin the process...

1861
02:44:53,516 --> 02:44:56,681
of looking for survivors
of your families.

1862
02:44:59,462 --> 02:45:04,066
In most cases,
you won't find them.

1863
02:45:05,217 --> 02:45:08,573
After six long years of murder,

1864
02:45:08,669 --> 02:45:13,848
victims are being mourned
throughout the world.

1865
02:45:13,944 --> 02:45:16,916
We've survived.

1866
02:45:16,917 --> 02:45:20,945
Many of you have come up
to me and thanked me.

1867
02:45:22,863 --> 02:45:24,974
Thank yourselves.

1868
02:45:26,125 --> 02:45:28,522
Thank your fearless Stern...

1869
02:45:28,617 --> 02:45:31,878
and others among you
who worried about you...

1870
02:45:31,879 --> 02:45:35,619
and faced death
at every moment.

1871
02:45:38,305 --> 02:45:40,988
I'm a member of the Nazi party.

1872
02:45:40,989 --> 02:45:43,962
I'm a munitions manufacturer.

1873
02:45:43,963 --> 02:45:46,552
I'm a profiteer of slave labor.

1874
02:45:46,648 --> 02:45:50,196
I am a criminal.

1875
02:45:50,293 --> 02:45:55,663
At midnight you'll be free,
and I'll be hunted.

1876
02:45:55,759 --> 02:45:59,021
I shall remain with you until
five minutes after midnight.

1877
02:45:59,116 --> 02:46:02,281
After which time,
and I hope you'll forgive me,

1878
02:46:02,377 --> 02:46:04,295
I have to flee.

1879
02:46:06,885 --> 02:46:10,624
I know you have received orders
from our Commandant,

1880
02:46:10,625 --> 02:46:14,941
which he has received
from his superiors, to dispose
of the population of this camp.

1881
02:46:15,036 --> 02:46:18,106
Now would be the time to do it.

1882
02:46:18,201 --> 02:46:23,475
Here they are, they're all here.
This is your opportunity.

1883
02:46:27,696 --> 02:46:30,190
Or you could leave,

1884
02:46:30,285 --> 02:46:33,642
and return to
your families as men...

1885
02:46:33,738 --> 02:46:37,287
instead of murderers.

1886
02:47:15,553 --> 02:47:19,581
In memory of the countless
victims among your people,

1887
02:47:19,582 --> 02:47:23,514
I ask us to observe
three minutes of silence.

1901
02:48:16,646 --> 02:48:19,235
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.
Thank you,

1902
02:48:19,236 --> 02:48:21,632
Thank you,
Mr. Jereth.
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

1903
02:48:21,633 --> 02:48:23,934
Open wide.

1904
02:48:25,374 --> 02:48:27,195
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

1905
02:48:44,747 --> 02:48:47,528
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

1906
02:49:10,641 --> 02:49:14,478
As soon as peace occurs,
I want...

1907
02:49:14,573 --> 02:49:18,314
um, I want that cloth
distributed to the workers.

1908
02:49:18,410 --> 02:49:20,999
Two and a half meters each.

1909
02:49:21,095 --> 02:49:24,069
Also, each person is
to get a bottle of vodka.

1910
02:49:24,164 --> 02:49:26,945
They won't drink it.
They know its value.

1911
02:49:27,042 --> 02:49:30,398
Likewise for those
Egipshi cigarettes
we organized.

1912
02:49:30,495 --> 02:49:34,235
It'll be done.
Everything you ask.

1913
02:49:52,936 --> 02:49:56,484
We've written a letter,
trying to explain things...

1914
02:49:56,581 --> 02:49:58,786
in case you are captured.

1915
02:50:01,376 --> 02:50:04,349
Every worker has signed it.

1916
02:50:14,228 --> 02:50:16,049
Thank you.

1917
02:50:41,560 --> 02:50:44,246
It is Hebrew, from the Talmud.

1918
02:50:44,342 --> 02:50:49,808
It says,
"Whoever saves one life,
saves the world entire."

1919
02:51:27,116 --> 02:51:29,418
I could have got more out.

1920
02:51:31,624 --> 02:51:34,309
I could have got more.
I don't know.

1921
02:51:34,310 --> 02:51:36,706
If I just--

1922
02:51:36,707 --> 02:51:39,103
I could have got more.

1923
02:51:39,104 --> 02:51:44,186
Oskar, there are 1,100 people
who are alive because of you.
Look at them.

1924
02:51:44,187 --> 02:51:46,873
If I'd made more money.

1925
02:51:50,326 --> 02:51:55,408
I threw away so much money.

1926
02:51:55,505 --> 02:51:58,861
You have no idea.

1927
02:51:58,958 --> 02:52:00,971
If I had just--

1928
02:52:01,067 --> 02:52:05,287
There will be generations
because of what you did.

1929
02:52:05,384 --> 02:52:08,260
I didn't do enough.

1930
02:52:08,357 --> 02:52:11,617
You did so much.

1931
02:52:14,686 --> 02:52:16,796
This car.

1932
02:52:16,892 --> 02:52:19,096
Goeth would've bought this car.

1933
02:52:19,097 --> 02:52:23,030
Why did I keep the car?
Ten people right there.

1934
02:52:26,195 --> 02:52:28,688
Ten people.

1935
02:52:28,689 --> 02:52:30,703
Ten more people.

1936
02:52:33,676 --> 02:52:35,880
This pin.

1937
02:52:35,881 --> 02:52:39,526
Two people.

1938
02:52:39,621 --> 02:52:41,635
This is gold.

1939
02:52:41,636 --> 02:52:43,552
Two more people.

1940
02:52:43,553 --> 02:52:46,239
He would have given me
two for it; at least one.

1941
02:52:46,336 --> 02:52:49,596
He would have given me one,
one more.

1942
02:52:51,898 --> 02:52:55,733
One more person.

1943
02:52:55,734 --> 02:52:59,090
A person, Stern.

1944
02:52:59,091 --> 02:53:01,777
For this.

1945
02:53:03,599 --> 02:53:07,339
I could have gotten...

1946
02:53:07,434 --> 02:53:11,846
one more person and I didn't.

1947
02:53:11,942 --> 02:53:15,778
And I-I didn't!

1948
02:54:40,081 --> 02:54:43,054
You have been liberated...

1949
02:54:43,149 --> 02:54:46,602
by the Soviet Army!

1950
02:54:53,220 --> 02:54:55,234
Have you been in Poland?

1951
02:54:55,329 --> 02:54:58,781
I just came from Poland.

1952
02:54:58,782 --> 02:55:01,755
Are there anyJews left?

1953
02:55:07,030 --> 02:55:09,427
Where should we go?

1954
02:55:09,524 --> 02:55:11,729
Don't go east, that's for sure.

1955
02:55:11,826 --> 02:55:14,894
They hate you there.

1956
02:55:14,991 --> 02:55:18,539
I wouldn't go west either,
if I were you.

1957
02:55:18,634 --> 02:55:22,566
We could use some food.

1958
02:55:22,663 --> 02:55:27,651
Isn't that a town over there?
