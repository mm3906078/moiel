1
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:23,308
Name?

2
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,753
Horowitz, Salomon.

3
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,089
Schneider, Sarah.

4
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,703
Birnbaum, Olga.

5
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:36,821
Over there.
Kommen Sie doch. (Come, come).

6
00:02:36,882 --> 00:02:37,912
Over there!

7
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,632
Isak Hudes.

8
00:02:43,606 --> 00:02:45,148
Zucker, Helena.

9
00:02:45,508 --> 00:02:47,602
Zucker, Helena.

10
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,767
Hirsch, Salomon?

11
00:02:49,927 --> 00:02:51,144
Hirsch, Salomon.

12
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:52,363
Hauptman, Chaim!

13
00:02:52,722 --> 00:02:54,810
Weisman! Weisman, Marcus!

14
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:56,029
Feber, Ludwig!

15
00:02:56,514 --> 00:02:57,612
Feber, Ludwig.

16
00:02:57,861 --> 00:02:59,283
Elsa Bauman.

17
00:03:01,358 --> 00:03:03,271
-Josef Klein.
-Klein.

18
00:03:03,537 --> 00:03:04,917
Davidowich, Ignacy.

19
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,236
Paula Biffer.

20
00:03:06,297 --> 00:03:07,817
Nadel, Rachela.

21
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:09,725
-Steiner, Gertruda.
-Steiner, Hilda.

22
00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:11,643
-Jerzy, you know who that man is?
-I don't know.

23
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:32,862
Let's get together, please.

24
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,855
Smile. Good.

25
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,163
Yes, sir.

26
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:12,388
Bring them over a round of drinks.

27
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,421
Very good, sir. And who
shall I say they are from?

28
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:21,401
You can say they are from me.

29
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:44,195
From the gentleman.

30
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:45,532
Where?

31
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,538
Do you know him?

32
00:06:55,275 --> 00:06:56,407
Find out who he is.

33
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:57,602
Yes, sir.

34
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:05,625
Agnieszka, I would give anything
to hear you sing tonight.

35
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:07,751
But I know you won't.

36
00:07:10,674 --> 00:07:12,053
You embarrass me.

37
00:07:21,687 --> 00:07:22,699
What's he doing?

38
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:27,114
Stay here.

39
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:33,082
How are you doing?

40
00:07:33,613 --> 00:07:36,092
You'd leave a woman alone at the
table in a place like this?

41
00:07:38,253 --> 00:07:40,475
Sweetheart, you're the
picture of loneliness.

42
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:42,104
Oh.

43
00:07:43,688 --> 00:07:46,307
Mmm, what a lovely fragrance.
You are breaking my heart.

44
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:48,948
An extra chair, please.
Vodka for my friend.

45
00:07:49,154 --> 00:07:50,219
And for the lady?

46
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,506
Pernod.

47
00:08:02,242 --> 00:08:04,745
Come to the table, girls!
Drink with us!

48
00:08:10,983 --> 00:08:12,691
Come to us! Marry us!

49
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:32,645
Thank you.

50
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:34,789
I'll tell you what I
mean by cooperative.

51
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:36,360
Two days after the law is passed

52
00:08:36,421 --> 00:08:38,140
that all Jews have to wear the star,

53
00:08:38,305 --> 00:08:40,227
the Jewish tailors are turning
them out by the gross

54
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,924
in a variety of fabrics
at three zloty each.

55
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:44,566
Tell me about your cellar wines.

56
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:48,066
-I have an excellent German Riesling. 1937.
-Mmm, French.

57
00:08:48,336 --> 00:08:51,089
-A Bordeaux. Chateau Latour, '28, '29?
-No, I'm sorry.

58
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,850
It's as if they have no idea
what kind of law it is.

59
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,579
As if it's the emblem of a riding club.

60
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:58,440
-A Margaux, '29?
-No, no, we don't have that.

61
00:08:58,618 --> 00:09:01,315
-Burgundy then? A Romanee-Conti, '37?
-Yes.

62
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:04,029
It's human nature.
'We'll do this to avoid that.'

63
00:09:04,513 --> 00:09:06,923
That's what they have done
since thousands of years.

64
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:09,250
It's what they do.
They weather the storm.

65
00:09:09,311 --> 00:09:12,887
But this storm is different. This is
not the Romans. This storm is the SS.

66
00:09:44,396 --> 00:09:45,094
Martin.

67
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,035
Yes, sir.

68
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:49,606
Who is that man?

69
00:09:51,873 --> 00:09:53,631
That's Oskar Schindler!

70
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:49,416
An alle Juden!
(To all Jews)

71
00:10:49,897 --> 00:10:53,790
Ab sofort ist es allen Juden untersagt...
(From now on all Jews are forbidden...)

72
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:56,572
Fleisch auf koschere Art zuzubereiten.
(to prepare kosher meat)

73
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,313
Meldung an alle Juden. Ab sofort...
(Message to all Jews. From now on...)

74
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:23,796
-Rabbi...
-Private property cannot be confiscated.

75
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:24,849
How long are the schools
going to be closed?

76
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:25,510
I do not know.

77
00:11:25,723 --> 00:11:27,551
'Article 47, pillage is
formally prohibited.'

78
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:28,770
You don't know anything!

79
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,925
I am familiar with the Hague Convention.
Religious...

80
00:11:30,986 --> 00:11:34,872
They come into our house and tell
us we don't live there anymore.

81
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,201
It now belongs to a certain SS officer.

82
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:40,381
Please. I only know what they tell me.

83
00:11:40,442 --> 00:11:43,599
And what they tell me
changes from day to day.

84
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,898
Aren't you supposed to be able to help?

85
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:49,792
I mean, what if I just
took this thing off?

86
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:51,515
What are they going to do about it?

87
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:52,839
They will shoot you.

88
00:11:53,132 --> 00:11:55,507
-Why don't you stop this silly talk?
-Itzhak Stern!

89
00:11:57,442 --> 00:11:58,881
I'm looking for Itzhak Stern.

90
00:12:02,136 --> 00:12:03,777
Are you Itzhak Stern or not?

91
00:12:05,384 --> 00:12:07,444
-I am.
-Where can we talk?

92
00:12:18,214 --> 00:12:21,221
There's a company you did the
books for on Lipowa Street.

93
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,260
Made what? Pots and pans?

94
00:12:24,657 --> 00:12:27,001
By law, I have to tell
you, sir, I'm a Jew.

95
00:12:27,823 --> 00:12:30,342
Well, I'm a German. So there we are.

96
00:12:34,636 --> 00:12:35,791
A good company, you think?

97
00:12:35,947 --> 00:12:37,290
Modestly successful.

98
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,477
I know nothing about enamelware.
Do you?

99
00:12:40,557 --> 00:12:42,070
I was just the accountant.

100
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,364
Simple engineering though,
wouldn't you think?

101
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,018
Change the machines around,
whatever you do...

102
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:48,536
you could make other
things, couldn't you?

103
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:53,928
Field kits, mess kits.
Army contracts.

104
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:59,125
Once the war ends, forget
it, but for now it's great.

105
00:12:59,203 --> 00:13:00,697
You can make a fortune,
don't you think?

106
00:13:01,122 --> 00:13:03,904
I think most people right now
have other priorities.

107
00:13:05,275 --> 00:13:06,043
Like what?

108
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,238
I'm sure you'll do just fine
once you get the contracts.

109
00:13:10,298 --> 00:13:12,198
In fact, the worse things get,
the better you'll do.

110
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:15,663
Well, I can get the signatures I need.
That's the easy part.

111
00:13:16,304 --> 00:13:19,064
Finding the money to buy
the company, that's hard.

112
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:21,518
You don't have any money?

113
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:25,301
Not that kind of money.
You know anybody?

114
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,951
Jews, yeah. Investors.

115
00:13:30,902 --> 00:13:33,841
You must have contacts in the Jewish
business community, working here.

116
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:36,593
What community? Jews can
no longer own businesses.

117
00:13:36,674 --> 00:13:38,032
That's why this one's in receivership.

118
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,430
But they wouldn't own it.

119
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:42,581
I'd own it. I'd pay them back
in product, pots and pans.

120
00:13:42,914 --> 00:13:43,901
Pots and pans.

121
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:45,801
Something they can use.

122
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:47,900
Something they can feel in their hands.

123
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,280
They can trade it on the black market,

124
00:13:49,341 --> 00:13:51,159
do whatever they want.
Everybody's happy.

125
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:56,054
If you want, you could
run the company for me.

126
00:14:01,432 --> 00:14:02,548
Let me understand.

127
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:06,198
They'd put up all the
money, I'd do all the work.

128
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:08,150
What, if you don't mind
my asking, would you do?

129
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:11,967
I'd make sure it's known
the company's in business.

130
00:14:12,028 --> 00:14:14,301
I'd see that it had a certain panache.

131
00:14:14,422 --> 00:14:16,885
That's what I'm good at, not the work.
Not the work.

132
00:14:18,741 --> 00:14:19,678
The presentation.

133
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,121
I'm sure I don't know anybody
who'll be interested in this.

134
00:14:44,907 --> 00:14:46,813
Well, they should be, Itzhak Stern.

135
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,912
Tell them they should be.

136
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,543
Achtung! Achtung!
(Attention! Attention!)

137
00:15:02,912 --> 00:15:08,425
An alle Juden. Ab sofort ist es verboten...
(To all Jews. From now on it is forbidden ...)

138
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:25,863
I've got a client who'll sell
marks for zloty at 2.45-to-1.

139
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:27,801
Wool, mink collar.
It's a nice coat.

140
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:29,854
She'll trade it for ration coupons.

141
00:15:30,156 --> 00:15:31,610
Wicks, for lamps.

142
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,449
You have a truckload of wicks?

143
00:15:33,524 --> 00:15:35,822
What am I going to do with
a truckload of wicks?

144
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:37,391
Nine by 12, nine by 14.

145
00:15:37,751 --> 00:15:40,034
-I don't know.
-Big, beautiful, Persian.

146
00:15:44,282 --> 00:15:44,908
Past.

147
00:15:45,636 --> 00:15:46,136
What?

148
00:15:46,407 --> 00:15:48,284
You don't recognize this?
It's shoe polish.

149
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,571
In metal containers?

150
00:15:50,214 --> 00:15:51,148
You asked for shoe polish.

151
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:53,192
In metal containers. This is glass.

152
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,277
It's not what I asked for.

153
00:15:54,397 --> 00:15:56,042
-What's the difference?
-What's the difference?

154
00:15:56,143 --> 00:15:57,112
What's the difference?

155
00:15:57,798 --> 00:15:59,531
My client sold it to his client,

156
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,016
who sold it to the German army.

157
00:16:01,346 --> 00:16:02,848
Only by the time it got there, because

158
00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:05,829
of the freezing cold, it broke.
All 10,000 units.

159
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,188
Mmm, ooh, ooh, ooh.
This is not my problem.

160
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,834
-This is not his problem.
-This is not your problem?

161
00:16:09,894 --> 00:16:10,925
This is not my problem.

162
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,655
All right.

163
00:16:13,979 --> 00:16:16,381
The German army wants to
find out where it came from.

164
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,997
I am going to make sure they find out.

165
00:16:19,184 --> 00:16:20,209
Now it's your problem.

166
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,036
You, be quiet!

167
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,418
Metal containers.

168
00:16:27,206 --> 00:16:27,900
Hello.

169
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:32,463
Pardon me for interfering,
but that's a nice shirt.

170
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:34,683
Nice shirt.

171
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,335
Do you know where I can find
a nice shirt like that?

172
00:16:46,988 --> 00:16:47,895
Like this?

173
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:51,377
It's illegal to buy or sell
anything on the street.

174
00:16:51,815 --> 00:16:54,364
We don't do that.
We're here to pray.

175
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:03,080
Do you have any idea how much
a shirt like this costs?

176
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:04,496
Nice things cost money.

177
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,376
How many?

178
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:24,329
I'm going to need some other
things, too, as things come up.

179
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:26,076
This won't be a problem.

180
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,270
From time to time.

181
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:30,931
Achtung! Achtung!
(Attention! Attention)

182
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:15,492
Name? Adresse?
(Name? Address?)

183
00:18:15,681 --> 00:18:16,935
Formular ausfullen!
(Fill out the form!)

184
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:18,248
Weiter, weiter!
(Move on, move on!)

185
00:18:18,491 --> 00:18:19,334
Nicht drangeln!
(Do not push!)

186
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:20,511
Kommen Sie hier!
(Come here!)

187
00:18:21,326 --> 00:18:22,556
Stehen sie sich doch an!
(Stand by!)

188
00:19:09,657 --> 00:19:11,125
Achtung, Achtung!
(Attention! Attention)

189
00:19:11,242 --> 00:19:13,499
Alle Juden sind verpflichtet...
(All Jews are accommodated...)

190
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:16,832
im abgesonderten judischen Bezirk zu wohnen.
(in the separate Jewish district.)

191
00:19:16,997 --> 00:19:21,203
Nichteinhaltung der Meldepflicht bei der
(Failure to comply with the obligation to report)

192
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:25,730
Einwohnerbehorde beim Militargericht.
(to the resident's authority will be dealt by the military court).

193
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:31,221
This is obviously the right place.
How are you doing?

194
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:39,563
Goodbye, Jews!
Goodbye, Jews!

195
00:19:39,966 --> 00:19:41,762
Goodbye, Jews!

196
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:50,118
Goodbye, Jews!
Goodbye, Jews!

197
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,922
Goodbye, Jews!

198
00:19:55,786 --> 00:19:57,626
-This is the vecheka, Moyshe.
-Ojciec.

199
00:19:58,312 --> 00:19:59,837
Nyne, this kan neash zyane.
(No. This can not be true.)

200
00:20:13,554 --> 00:20:14,659
Oh, my God.

201
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,532
Oy, God. Oh, my God.

202
00:20:26,097 --> 00:20:27,231
Oh, my God.

203
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,847
It could not be better.

204
00:20:38,018 --> 00:20:39,088
It could be worse.

205
00:20:39,515 --> 00:20:40,917
How? Tell me.

206
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,358
How on earth could it
possibly be worse?

207
00:20:46,265 --> 00:20:47,229
Dzien dobry.
(Good morning!)

208
00:20:49,003 --> 00:20:49,807
Dzien dobry.
(Good morning).

209
00:20:49,868 --> 00:20:50,937
Dzien dobry.
Good morning).

210
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,273
Dzien dobry.
(Good morning).

211
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:53,873
Dzien dobry.
(Good morning).

212
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:54,728
Dzien dobry.
(Good morning).

213
00:20:59,543 --> 00:21:00,910
-Hey, Goldberg.
-Poldek.

214
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,208
What's this?

215
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:05,819
The Judenrat has its own
police now, Poldek.

216
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:06,651
You don't say.

217
00:21:06,953 --> 00:21:08,000
Ordnungsdienst.
(By order)

218
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,488
-I'm a policeman now, could you believe it?
-It's hard to believe.

219
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,937
No, it's not hard to believe.

220
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,666
It's a good racket, Poldek.
The only racket here.

221
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:18,836
Look, maybe I could put in a good
word for you with my superiors.

222
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:20,079
Your superiors?

223
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:22,730
Come on, they are not as bad
as everyone says.

224
00:21:23,854 --> 00:21:25,624
Well, they're worse than everyone says,

225
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:28,198
but it's a lot of money.
A lot of money.

226
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,466
Give me my housing assignment.

227
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:33,565
Come on.

228
00:21:34,124 --> 00:21:35,825
You look funny in that hat, Goldberg.

229
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,367
You look like a clown, you know.

230
00:21:46,313 --> 00:21:49,491
He's a very important man. Just
give him two minutes of your time.

231
00:21:49,552 --> 00:21:52,741
-Since when did time cost money?
-Just sit down and listen.

232
00:21:53,404 --> 00:21:54,575
Please. Sir?

233
00:21:59,034 --> 00:22:01,287
For each 1,000 you invest,
I will repay you with...

234
00:22:01,348 --> 00:22:03,490
two hundred kilos of
enamelware a month,

235
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:05,396
to begin in July and to
continue for one year.

236
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,784
After which time, we're even.

237
00:22:07,588 --> 00:22:09,330
That's it. It's very simple.

238
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,465
Not good enough.

239
00:22:10,526 --> 00:22:11,608
It's not good enough.

240
00:22:12,272 --> 00:22:13,484
Not good enough?

241
00:22:14,717 --> 00:22:18,522
Look where you're living. Look where
you've been put. 'Not good enough.'

242
00:22:18,888 --> 00:22:21,027
A couple of months ago you'd be right.
Not anymore.

243
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:23,514
Money's still money.

244
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:27,603
No, it is not.

245
00:22:28,563 --> 00:22:30,045
That's why we're here.

246
00:22:30,608 --> 00:22:32,404
Trade goods, that's the only currency

247
00:22:32,465 --> 00:22:34,249
that'll be worth
anything in the ghetto.

248
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,218
Things have changed, my friend.

249
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:40,797
Did I call this meeting?

250
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,792
You told Mr. Stern you
wanted to speak to me.

251
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:45,494
I'm here. I've made you a fair offer.

252
00:22:46,075 --> 00:22:49,839
Fair would be a percentage
in the company.

253
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:54,422
Forget the whole thing. Get out.

254
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,148
How do we know that you
will do what you say?

255
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:04,920
Because I said I would.

256
00:23:05,264 --> 00:23:07,642
You want a contract?
To be upheld by what court?

257
00:23:07,703 --> 00:23:09,519
I said what I'll do.
That's our contract.

258
00:23:14,058 --> 00:23:15,094
...mielismy racje.
(...we were right)

259
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:32,301
Piec, szesc, siedem,
(Five, six, seven)

260
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,973
osiem, dziewiec.
(eight, nine)

261
00:23:48,978 --> 00:23:52,658
The standard SS rate for Jewish skilled
labourers is seven marks a day,

262
00:23:53,148 --> 00:23:54,907
five for unskilled and women.

263
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:59,226
This is what you pay
the Reich Economic Office.

264
00:23:59,287 --> 00:24:01,369
The Jews themselves receive nothing.

265
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:03,507
Poles you pay wages.

266
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,041
Generally, they get a little more.

267
00:24:06,364 --> 00:24:07,311
Are you listening?

268
00:24:07,499 --> 00:24:08,876
What was that about the SS?

269
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,737
The rate? The what?

270
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:12,563
The Jewish worker's salary.

271
00:24:12,624 --> 00:24:14,755
You pay it directly to the
SS, not to the worker.

272
00:24:14,816 --> 00:24:16,798
-He gets nothing.
-But it's less.

273
00:24:16,938 --> 00:24:18,472
It's less than what I would pay a Pole.

274
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:19,182
It's less.

275
00:24:19,368 --> 00:24:21,059
That's the point I'm trying to make.

276
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,683
Poles cost more.

277
00:24:25,973 --> 00:24:27,767
Why should I hire Poles?

278
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,814
An enamelware factory
over at Lipowa Street.

279
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,418
It's owned by a German.

280
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:40,447
But it's outside the ghetto, so
you can barter for extra goods,

281
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:42,038
for eggs, I don't know what you need,

282
00:24:42,099 --> 00:24:43,791
with the Polish workers.
You can't get it here.

283
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:47,627
Also, he's asking for
10 healthy women for the...

284
00:24:47,688 --> 00:24:48,589
I am healthy.

285
00:24:50,075 --> 00:24:51,497
Bring your sister, okay?

286
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:57,880
Chodz.
(Come.)

287
00:24:58,531 --> 00:25:00,363
You need to convince
them you have a trade,

288
00:25:00,424 --> 00:25:01,964
something valuable to the war effort.

289
00:25:02,025 --> 00:25:02,689
-Like what?
-What if you don't?

290
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:03,805
I'm a musician.

291
00:25:04,515 --> 00:25:05,463
Your name goes on a list.

292
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,810
I hear your name goes on a list
and they put you on trucks...

293
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,892
-No, no, that's not true.
-You're a musician?

294
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,034
-Lisa!
-Yeah.

295
00:25:11,095 --> 00:25:12,612
I'd find a good hiding
place if I were you.

296
00:25:12,673 --> 00:25:14,529
I'm not going to hide like some animal.

297
00:25:15,256 --> 00:25:16,553
There are places to hide.

298
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:26,237
I'm a graduate of the
University of Lviv.

299
00:25:27,707 --> 00:25:30,426
I used to work at the
hydroelectric station in Roznow.

300
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:31,427
Blauschein.
(Blue card).

301
00:25:36,032 --> 00:25:37,524
I'm gonna get the necessary papers

302
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:39,521
because this card is no good anymore.

303
00:25:40,031 --> 00:25:42,470
You can stay in this line all day,
you'll still get one of these.

304
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:46,127
They are no good. You'll
have to leave the line now,

305
00:25:46,353 --> 00:25:48,414
then you'll get
a blue card, a Blauschein,

306
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,899
to say that you are
an essential worker.

307
00:25:50,974 --> 00:25:53,356
I'll get these papers
for you at Pankiewicz.

308
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,861
Pharmacist. Just there, look.

309
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,487
Guess who is here?

310
00:25:58,065 --> 00:26:00,864
Poldek!
Enjoying the weather, Poldek?

311
00:26:00,943 --> 00:26:01,981
Enjoying the lines?

312
00:26:02,324 --> 00:26:03,667
Need some shoe polish?

313
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:05,037
In a metal container maybe?

314
00:26:06,604 --> 00:26:07,668
Not essential?

315
00:26:08,089 --> 00:26:10,919
I think you misunderstand
the meaning of the word.

316
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,858
No Blauschein (Blue card), sir.

317
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:15,304
Stand over there. Move. Next!

318
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:18,549
What do you mean, 'Not essential'?

319
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,387
I teach history and literature.

320
00:26:23,026 --> 00:26:24,736
Since when it's not essential?

321
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,776
He's a metal polisher.

322
00:26:39,976 --> 00:26:40,909
It was not right?

323
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,564
It's very good. He's 53 years old.

324
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:43,618
It's too new.

325
00:26:43,711 --> 00:26:44,747
Mmm. Thank you.

326
00:26:53,882 --> 00:26:55,884
You're crazy. You left
it in your drawer.

327
00:26:56,419 --> 00:26:58,077
How many times have I told you?

328
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:01,457
Your work certificate you keep
in your pocket at all times.

329
00:27:01,628 --> 00:27:05,098
And you leave yours in your drawer.
How many times I've told you?

330
00:27:06,664 --> 00:27:08,148
I'm a metal polisher.

331
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:20,079
Take the round sheet of tin,

332
00:27:21,586 --> 00:27:24,046
dip it in soap emulsion,

333
00:27:25,483 --> 00:27:28,824
then place it centrally in the press.

334
00:27:44,922 --> 00:27:46,285
We obtain the soup pot.

335
00:27:47,293 --> 00:27:48,156
The soup pot.

336
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,844
Soup pot.

337
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:53,977
Grosz, Mrs. Grosz, stay together.

338
00:27:59,228 --> 00:28:02,372
Sir, I have 10 work permits here

339
00:28:02,433 --> 00:28:04,574
for the Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik
(German Enamel Factory)

340
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,153
cosigned by Mr. Bankier and myself.

341
00:28:07,736 --> 00:28:11,694
If it's carbonized,
clean it with a file.

342
00:28:12,866 --> 00:28:16,766
But don't touch both the
electrodes at the same time.

343
00:28:17,204 --> 00:28:20,128
You'll get electrocuted.
Here, have a try.

344
00:28:24,624 --> 00:28:26,599
Roll the metal under the press,

345
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,553
but be very careful unless
you want your fingers

346
00:28:29,633 --> 00:28:31,476
to become part of the teapot.

347
00:28:34,137 --> 00:28:34,909
Occupation?

348
00:28:35,157 --> 00:28:37,648
I'm a writer. I play the flute.

349
00:28:37,709 --> 00:28:41,348
But Moses is a skilled metalworker.

350
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:43,509
He can make tin pots.
He can make tanks.

351
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,399
He can make whatever
Mr. Schindler asks.

352
00:28:45,482 --> 00:28:49,474
He's highly skilled. Give him your card.
Moses, give him your card.

353
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,957
Now, dip the basin with the
tongs into the enamel solution.

354
00:28:59,663 --> 00:29:03,791
And after swivelling it around,
carefully place it aside to drip dry.

355
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,899
And whatever he asks you, allow me

356
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,007
just to represent
you and speak for you.

357
00:29:11,091 --> 00:29:12,559
Don't say a word.

358
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:16,396
Filing, billing, keeping track
of my appointments, shorthand.

359
00:29:16,626 --> 00:29:18,797
Typing, obviously.
How is your typing?

360
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:20,771
Uh, all right.

361
00:29:20,832 --> 00:29:21,365
Please.

362
00:30:15,742 --> 00:30:17,744
You need a secretary.
Pick one.

363
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:23,039
I don't know how.
They're all so qualified.

364
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:25,866
You have to choose.

365
00:30:29,444 --> 00:30:30,399
Prosze sie ladnie usmiechac.
(Please give a nice smile).

366
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,896
Big smile. Big smile.

367
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:32,851
Uwaga.
(Attention).

368
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:55,644
If you would, look after my guest.

369
00:30:57,495 --> 00:31:00,549
Boxed teas are good. Coffee, pate,

370
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:04,671
kielbasa sausage,
cheeses, Beluga caviar.

371
00:31:05,413 --> 00:31:06,423
-Yes.
-And, of course,

372
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:07,606
who could live without
German cigarettes?

373
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,151
Get me as many as you can find.

374
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:11,336
And some more fresh fruit.

375
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,600
The real rarities, oranges,
lemons, pineapples.

376
00:31:15,227 --> 00:31:17,600
I need several boxes of Cuban cigars.
The best.

377
00:31:18,053 --> 00:31:19,368
Yes. And dark, unsweetened chocolate.

378
00:31:19,554 --> 00:31:21,676
Not in the shape of lady
fingers, the chunk chocolate.

379
00:31:21,763 --> 00:31:23,545
Big as my hand, you
sample at wine tastings.

380
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:24,850
Yes.

381
00:31:24,975 --> 00:31:27,789
We're going to need lots of cognac.
The best, Hennessy.

382
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,515
Dom Perignon champagne.

383
00:31:31,086 --> 00:31:32,631
Get L'Espadon sardines,

384
00:31:33,108 --> 00:31:36,282
and, oh, try to find nylon stockings.

385
00:31:39,823 --> 00:31:42,570
It is my distinct pleasure to announce

386
00:31:42,742 --> 00:31:47,896
the fully operational status
of Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik.

387
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:49,008
Patrz jakies szmaty! (See some rags!)

388
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:52,790
Manufacturers of superior
enamelware crockery,

389
00:31:53,753 --> 00:31:57,881
expressly designed and
crafted for military use.

390
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:01,345
Utilizing only the
most modern equipment,

391
00:32:01,494 --> 00:32:04,028
D.E.F.'s staff of highly skilled and

392
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,358
experienced artisans and journeymen

393
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:09,496
deliver a product of
unparalleled quality,

394
00:32:10,312 --> 00:32:14,053
enabling me to proffer, with
absolute confidence and pride,

395
00:32:14,283 --> 00:32:16,841
a full line of field and kitchenware

396
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:19,906
unsurpassable in all
respects by my competitors.

397
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:23,549
See attached list and
available colours.

398
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:28,247
Anticipating the enclosed bids
will meet with your approval

399
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:32,380
and looking forward to a long and
mutually prosperous association,

400
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:35,843
I extend to you in advance
my sincerest gratitude

401
00:32:35,939 --> 00:32:37,484
and very best regards.

402
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:38,767
Oskar Schindler.

403
00:32:38,927 --> 00:32:42,060
Yeah, I need 700 gross from
here for next Thursday.

404
00:32:42,385 --> 00:32:45,013
Nine hundred, no, make
it 10 for Wednesday.

405
00:32:45,074 --> 00:32:46,917
All this stuff here goes to Madritsch's

406
00:32:46,978 --> 00:32:48,821
factory on Tuesday of next week.

407
00:33:05,242 --> 00:33:07,972
My father was fond of saying,
'You need three things in life,

408
00:33:08,844 --> 00:33:09,930
a good doctor,

409
00:33:10,783 --> 00:33:12,277
a forgiving priest,

410
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:14,546
and a clever accountant.'

411
00:33:19,381 --> 00:33:20,590
The first two,

412
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:23,241
I've never had much use for.

413
00:33:23,561 --> 00:33:25,400
But the third...

414
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:35,272
Just pretend, for Christ's sake.

415
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:40,719
Is that all?

416
00:33:47,742 --> 00:33:48,978
I'm trying to thank you.

417
00:33:51,465 --> 00:33:53,912
I'm saying I couldn't have
done this without you.

418
00:33:57,843 --> 00:34:00,362
The usual thing would be to
acknowledge my gratitude.

419
00:34:00,451 --> 00:34:02,576
It would also, by the way,
be the courteous thing.

420
00:34:05,677 --> 00:34:06,559
You're welcome.

421
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,120
Get out of here.

422
00:34:32,662 --> 00:34:34,742
Klonowska, who is it?

423
00:34:45,342 --> 00:34:47,185
She's so embarrassed. Look at her.

424
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:01,685
You know something? You would like her.

425
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:03,586
-Oskar, please.
-What?

426
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,881
I don't have to like her
just because you do.

427
00:35:05,942 --> 00:35:06,660
You would, though.

428
00:35:06,721 --> 00:35:07,854
It doesn't work that way.

429
00:35:22,856 --> 00:35:24,086
You've done well here.

430
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,774
You look wonderful.

431
00:35:33,056 --> 00:35:34,649
Be careful of the step, miss.

432
00:35:35,016 --> 00:35:36,276
Mrs. Schindler, Marek.

433
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:51,203
It's not a charade, all this?

434
00:35:51,763 --> 00:35:53,460
A charade? How could it be a charade?

435
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:54,816
The clothes, the car, the apartment.

436
00:35:54,877 --> 00:35:55,754
Wait a minute.

437
00:35:55,815 --> 00:35:58,624
Take a guess how many
people are on my payroll.

438
00:35:58,707 --> 00:35:59,675
Oskar.

439
00:36:00,244 --> 00:36:04,512
My father, at the height of his
success, had 50. I've got 350.

440
00:36:05,536 --> 00:36:06,862
Three hundred and fifty workers

441
00:36:06,923 --> 00:36:09,142
on the factory floor, with one purpose.

442
00:36:10,385 --> 00:36:11,779
To make pots and pans?

443
00:36:12,261 --> 00:36:13,255
To make money.

444
00:36:14,182 --> 00:36:14,895
For me.

445
00:36:22,188 --> 00:36:24,782
Does anyone ask about me?

446
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:27,715
Back home?

447
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:29,828
Everybody.

448
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:31,154
All the time.

449
00:36:32,985 --> 00:36:33,601
Hmm.

450
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:41,062
They won't soon forget the name
Schindler here, I can tell you that.

451
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,845
'Oskar Schindler,' they'll say.

452
00:36:46,629 --> 00:36:48,459
'Everybody remembers him.'

453
00:36:50,717 --> 00:36:53,553
'He did something extraordinary.'

454
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,418
'He did something no one else did.'

455
00:37:00,476 --> 00:37:02,077
'He came here with nothing,'

456
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,616
a suitcase,

457
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:10,492
'and built a bankrupt company
into a major manufactory.'

458
00:37:12,614 --> 00:37:14,707
'And left with a steamer trunk.'

459
00:37:15,658 --> 00:37:18,197
'Two steamer trunks full of money.'

460
00:37:20,733 --> 00:37:22,550
'All the riches of the world.'

461
00:37:25,001 --> 00:37:25,702
Hmm.

462
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,654
It's comforting to see
that nothing's changed.

463
00:37:29,923 --> 00:37:31,639
You're wrong, Emilie.

464
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:36,373
There's no way I could
have known this before,

465
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:38,574
but there was always something missing.

466
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,177
Something was missing.

467
00:37:46,883 --> 00:37:48,291
Even if I'd known what it was,

468
00:37:48,352 --> 00:37:50,999
there's nothing I could have
done about it, because...

469
00:37:52,232 --> 00:37:53,840
you can't create this thing.

470
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,086
And it makes all the difference in the
world between success and failure.

471
00:38:01,326 --> 00:38:01,989
Luck?

472
00:38:05,397 --> 00:38:06,255
War.

473
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:33,332
Should I stay?

474
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:37,662
It's a beautiful city.

475
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:42,220
I asked you if I should stay.

476
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:46,870
It's up to you.

477
00:38:52,714 --> 00:38:53,804
Promise me, Oskar,

478
00:38:54,511 --> 00:38:57,002
no doorman or maitre
d' will ever presume

479
00:38:57,093 --> 00:38:58,875
I'm anyone other than Mrs. Schindler,

480
00:38:59,775 --> 00:39:00,802
and I'll stay.

481
00:39:04,689 --> 00:39:05,702
Goodbye, darling.

482
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:26,805
I could try to read this, or I could
eat my lunch while it's still hot.

483
00:39:28,524 --> 00:39:29,501
We're doing well?

484
00:39:29,751 --> 00:39:31,048
-Yes.
-Better this month than last?

485
00:39:31,127 --> 00:39:31,590
Yes.

486
00:39:31,651 --> 00:39:33,478
Any reason to think next
month will be worse?

487
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:34,694
The war could end.

488
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,478
What?

489
00:39:47,832 --> 00:39:49,251
There is a machinist outside

490
00:39:49,312 --> 00:39:51,659
who'd like to thank you
personally for giving him a job.

491
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:53,720
Every day he comes.

492
00:39:54,047 --> 00:39:56,128
He's very grateful. It'll
just take a minute.

493
00:40:03,623 --> 00:40:04,733
Mr. Lowenstein?

494
00:40:12,904 --> 00:40:15,593
I want to thank you, sir,

495
00:40:16,126 --> 00:40:18,636
for giving me the opportunity to work.

496
00:40:18,758 --> 00:40:21,028
You're welcome. I'm sure
you're doing a great job.

497
00:40:21,928 --> 00:40:26,253
The SS beat me up. They
would have killed me,

498
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:30,317
but I am essential to the
war effort, thanks to you.

499
00:40:31,188 --> 00:40:31,942
That's great.

500
00:40:33,022 --> 00:40:35,073
I work hard for you.

501
00:40:35,372 --> 00:40:36,556
I'm sure you do.

502
00:40:36,617 --> 00:40:39,353
I'll continue to work hard for you.

503
00:40:40,196 --> 00:40:41,618
That's great. Thanks.

504
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:42,771
God bless you, sir.

505
00:40:43,496 --> 00:40:44,263
All right.

506
00:40:44,324 --> 00:40:45,676
You are a good man.

507
00:40:49,662 --> 00:40:50,891
He saved my life.

508
00:40:50,952 --> 00:40:51,715
Yes, he did.

509
00:40:52,899 --> 00:40:53,765
God bless him.

510
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:54,991
Yeah. Come on.

511
00:40:58,047 --> 00:40:59,349
God bless you.

512
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:15,158
I'm sorry, Herr Direktor, but
you're running very late.

513
00:41:15,398 --> 00:41:18,627
This is for the
Obersturmbannfuhrer, sir.

514
00:41:18,688 --> 00:41:21,778
And this is for his niece, Greta.
It's her birthday.

515
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:22,237
By the way...

516
00:41:22,298 --> 00:41:23,182
Greta as in Garbo.

517
00:41:23,243 --> 00:41:25,086
don't ever do that to me again.

518
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:27,209
Go, go, drive!
Don't bow.

519
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:29,227
Did you happen to notice that
that man had one arm?

520
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:30,049
Did he?

521
00:41:35,016 --> 00:41:36,108
What's his use?

522
00:41:36,169 --> 00:41:37,019
Very useful.

523
00:41:40,423 --> 00:41:41,212
How?

524
00:41:41,273 --> 00:41:42,734
Very useful! Success!

525
00:42:12,872 --> 00:42:14,767
Besen und Schaufeln werden ausgeladen
(Brooms and shovels have been unloaded)

526
00:42:14,828 --> 00:42:17,741
jeder nimmt sich eine und dann wird die Strase gereinigt.
(Each one takes one and cleans the streets).

527
00:42:17,877 --> 00:42:19,346
We'll be late for work.

528
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,103
You shouldn't think of
them as yours, Oskar.

529
00:42:35,436 --> 00:42:37,530
You need to understand that
some of the officers here

530
00:42:37,606 --> 00:42:39,528
don't give a damn about production.

531
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:42,512
To them, it's a matter of...

532
00:42:43,246 --> 00:42:46,474
national priority that Jews
be made to shovel snow.

533
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:49,298
It's got nothing to do
with reality, Oskar.

534
00:42:49,642 --> 00:42:51,104
You know it and I know it.

535
00:42:51,994 --> 00:42:53,623
Jews shovelling snow,

536
00:42:54,129 --> 00:42:57,554
it's got a ritual significance.

537
00:43:00,586 --> 00:43:01,495
Come with me.

538
00:43:02,711 --> 00:43:04,053
I am an essential worker.

539
00:43:04,144 --> 00:43:05,133
Essential worker?

540
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:06,305
Yes.

541
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,563
I work for Oskar Schindler.

542
00:43:11,842 --> 00:43:13,432
Essential worker for Oskar Schindler.

543
00:43:13,493 --> 00:43:14,364
A one-armed Jew? Twice as useless!

544
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,774
-Yes, yes.
-Twice as useless!

545
00:43:17,657 --> 00:43:20,327
I lost a day of production, Rolf.

546
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:23,073
I work for Oskar Schindler.

547
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:27,914
Danka, look at the snow. Look at the snow.
Look at the snow!

548
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,656
I lost a worker.

549
00:43:34,652 --> 00:43:36,049
I expect to be compensated.

550
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:38,132
File a grievance with
the Economic Office.

551
00:43:38,412 --> 00:43:39,145
It's your right.

552
00:43:39,206 --> 00:43:40,259
Would it do any good?

553
00:43:40,802 --> 00:43:41,482
Of course not.

554
00:43:45,086 --> 00:43:48,337
A big shot from the SS Budget and
Construction Office came to lunch,

555
00:43:48,398 --> 00:43:50,531
and he told us that to believe...

556
00:43:50,948 --> 00:43:53,186
the Jewish skilled
worker had a place in...

557
00:43:53,403 --> 00:43:56,497
Reich economics was a treasonable idea.

558
00:44:01,532 --> 00:44:05,503
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?

559
00:44:05,849 --> 00:44:07,484
He was a metal press operator.

560
00:44:12,802 --> 00:44:13,767
Quite skilled.

561
00:44:44,362 --> 00:44:45,371
Herr Direktor?

562
00:44:46,317 --> 00:44:48,445
Shit. I don't believe it.

563
00:44:48,611 --> 00:44:50,165
Stern, is that you?

564
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:52,155
No, it's Poldek.

565
00:44:53,248 --> 00:44:54,282
It's about Stern.

566
00:44:55,581 --> 00:44:58,423
Leave your luggage on the platform.

567
00:44:59,247 --> 00:45:00,748
Clearly label it.

568
00:45:01,474 --> 00:45:05,007
Given name first, then your surname.

569
00:45:05,294 --> 00:45:07,861
Do not bring your baggage with you.

570
00:45:08,055 --> 00:45:10,265
It will follow you later.

571
00:45:11,133 --> 00:45:14,407
Leave your luggage on the platform.

572
00:45:14,895 --> 00:45:16,425
Clearly label it.

573
00:45:16,486 --> 00:45:19,313
Lassen Sie Ihr Gepack am Bahnsteig.
(Leave your luggage on the platform).

574
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:22,275
Stern?

575
00:45:25,606 --> 00:45:26,392
He's on the list.

576
00:45:27,118 --> 00:45:27,964
He is?

577
00:45:28,901 --> 00:45:29,932
Well, let's find him.

578
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:31,614
I'm sorry. You can't have him.

579
00:45:31,675 --> 00:45:32,495
He's on the list.

580
00:45:33,046 --> 00:45:34,589
If he were an essential worker
he would not be on the list.

581
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:36,725
I'm talking to a clerk.
What is your name?

582
00:45:37,451 --> 00:45:39,371
Sir, the list is correct.

583
00:45:39,432 --> 00:45:40,504
I didn't ask you about the list.

584
00:45:40,579 --> 00:45:41,550
I asked you your name.

585
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:43,184
Klaus Tauber.

586
00:45:45,416 --> 00:45:46,113
Tauber.

587
00:45:46,986 --> 00:45:48,004
Hauptscharfuhrer,

588
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:50,888
this gentleman thinks a
mistake's been made.

589
00:45:50,974 --> 00:45:53,184
My plant manager is
somewhere on this train.

590
00:45:53,718 --> 00:45:55,660
If it leaves with him on it,
it'll disrupt production

591
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,633
and the Armaments Board
will want to know why.

592
00:45:57,805 --> 00:45:59,513
Achtung, dieser Zug fahrt jetzt ab.
(Attention, the train is leaving now).

593
00:45:59,574 --> 00:46:00,586
Is he on the list?

594
00:46:00,795 --> 00:46:01,662
Yes, sir.

595
00:46:02,567 --> 00:46:04,256
Itzhak Stern.

596
00:46:04,979 --> 00:46:05,565
Well,

597
00:46:06,219 --> 00:46:07,666
the list is correct, sir.

598
00:46:08,245 --> 00:46:09,637
There is nothing I can do.

599
00:46:10,947 --> 00:46:11,741
What is your name?

600
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,689
Close and secure all doors.

601
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:14,490
My name?

602
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:17,101
-My name is Kunder.
-This train is now leaving.

603
00:46:17,578 --> 00:46:19,160
Kunder. Hauptscharfuhrer Kunder.

604
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:21,119
K-U-N-D-E-R. And what's yours?

605
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:23,677
Schindler. S-C-H-I-N-D-L-E-R.

606
00:46:23,998 --> 00:46:26,078
Gentlemen, thank you very much.

607
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,290
I think I can guarantee you

608
00:46:28,117 --> 00:46:29,672
you'll both be in Southern Russia

609
00:46:29,846 --> 00:46:31,920
before the end of the month. Good day.

610
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:33,201
Zamykac dokladnie drzwi.
(Close the door properly).

611
00:46:33,262 --> 00:46:34,449
Dokladnie zamykac drzwi.
(Close the door properly).

612
00:46:35,885 --> 00:46:36,802
Stern!

613
00:46:38,304 --> 00:46:39,900
Stern! Stern!

614
00:46:40,149 --> 00:46:41,526
Itzhak Stern!

615
00:46:48,856 --> 00:46:50,608
Stern! Itzhak Stern!

616
00:46:50,816 --> 00:46:52,113
Stern! Stern!

617
00:46:52,517 --> 00:46:53,624
Itzhak Stern!

618
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:55,997
Stern!

619
00:46:56,459 --> 00:46:57,039
Sir?

620
00:47:00,576 --> 00:47:02,621
-Stern!
-Herr Direktor.

621
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:05,067
My apologies.

622
00:47:05,943 --> 00:47:06,904
Stop the train!

623
00:47:07,071 --> 00:47:07,644
I apologize.

624
00:47:07,705 --> 00:47:08,363
He's here!

625
00:47:08,834 --> 00:47:09,954
Stop the train!

626
00:47:10,733 --> 00:47:12,844
Stop the train! Stop it!

627
00:47:26,121 --> 00:47:28,132
Sign here.
Initial there.

628
00:47:30,356 --> 00:47:32,212
Makes no difference to
us, you understand.

629
00:47:33,067 --> 00:47:34,172
This one, that one.

630
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:36,401
It's the inconvenience to the list.

631
00:47:37,181 --> 00:47:38,082
It's the paperwork.

632
00:47:38,382 --> 00:47:40,764
I somehow left my work card at home.

633
00:47:40,825 --> 00:47:43,999
I tried to explain them
it was a mistake, but...

634
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:46,183
I'm sorry, it was stupid!

635
00:47:46,244 --> 00:47:48,063
What if I got here five minutes later?

636
00:47:49,024 --> 00:47:50,226
Then where would I be?

637
00:49:42,988 --> 00:49:44,882
I woke up from a dream this morning.

638
00:49:45,768 --> 00:49:49,446
I was broke and sharing a room
with 12 people I didn't know,

639
00:49:49,984 --> 00:49:53,245
only to discover I was
broke and sharing

640
00:49:53,306 --> 00:49:55,648
a room with 12 people I didn't know.

641
00:49:56,255 --> 00:49:57,394
You laugh about it?

642
00:49:57,455 --> 00:49:58,707
I have to laugh.

643
00:49:58,963 --> 00:50:01,349
You are living behind walls.

644
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:03,102
The walls I can deal with.

645
00:50:04,049 --> 00:50:06,436
It's the restrictions to
my life I'm tired of.

646
00:50:06,549 --> 00:50:09,398
Those walls keep them out.
That's all I care about.

647
00:50:09,654 --> 00:50:10,469
I like it here.

648
00:50:10,981 --> 00:50:12,651
There's a kind of, I don't know,

649
00:50:12,867 --> 00:50:14,771
ancestral squalor to it all.

650
00:50:14,979 --> 00:50:17,031
-You are a slave to these people.
-No one envies us anymore.

651
00:50:17,092 --> 00:50:18,065
I'm smart.

652
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:19,237
Oh, yes, you're smart.

653
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:20,317
You're a real genius.

654
00:50:20,457 --> 00:50:21,504
You had your chance.

655
00:50:22,907 --> 00:50:26,165
Today, today I actually found
time to organize a thought.

656
00:50:26,824 --> 00:50:29,358
I can't remember
the last time I did that.

657
00:50:29,577 --> 00:50:31,329
When's the last time we did this?

658
00:50:31,412 --> 00:50:33,631
When's the last time
we stood around and talked?

659
00:50:33,844 --> 00:50:36,930
No one ordered me onto a truck today.

660
00:50:37,176 --> 00:50:39,253
No one took my business away from me.

661
00:50:39,628 --> 00:50:41,042
You don't really
have a business to take.

662
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:44,137
There's nowhere down from here.

663
00:50:44,198 --> 00:50:45,798
This is it.
This is the bottom.

664
00:50:46,635 --> 00:50:49,184
The ghetto is liberty.

665
00:50:56,729 --> 00:50:59,196
This street divides the ghetto
just about in half.

666
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:02,363
Right side, Ghetto A,

667
00:51:03,596 --> 00:51:04,798
civil employees,

668
00:51:05,611 --> 00:51:07,433
industrial workers, and so on.

669
00:51:08,706 --> 00:51:10,609
Left side, Ghetto B,

670
00:51:11,895 --> 00:51:13,096
surplus labour,

671
00:51:14,109 --> 00:51:16,009
the elderly and infirm, mostly.

672
00:51:16,332 --> 00:51:18,391
Which is where you will want to start.

673
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,451
Do you have any questions, sir?

674
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:23,689
Ja, why is the top down?
I'm fucking freezing.

675
00:51:26,634 --> 00:51:29,183
We expect a labour
force of 25,000 to 30,000.

676
00:51:29,535 --> 00:51:30,661
Segregated, of course.

677
00:51:31,063 --> 00:51:32,919
The men in the barracks
near the quarry.

678
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:34,149
The women on
the other side of the wire.

679
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:34,944
My place is where?

680
00:51:35,731 --> 00:51:36,398
There, sir.

681
00:51:36,602 --> 00:51:38,400
-There?
-Yes, the villa.

682
00:51:38,578 --> 00:51:39,899
You call that a villa?

683
00:51:40,133 --> 00:51:41,433
Their synagogue, can you see it?

684
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,357
That's not a villa.

685
00:51:42,441 --> 00:51:44,133
We're planning to turn it
into the camp stables.

686
00:51:44,193 --> 00:51:44,824
It's a house.

687
00:51:46,358 --> 00:51:47,278
What's that over there?

688
00:51:50,115 --> 00:51:51,883
Kindergarten.
Fifty-one.

689
00:51:52,841 --> 00:51:56,773
And we have a dentist,
shoemaker, practical physicians.

690
00:52:00,013 --> 00:52:01,209
There they are, sir.

691
00:52:03,212 --> 00:52:03,961
Hmm.

692
00:52:07,164 --> 00:52:09,823
One of you is a very lucky girl.

693
00:52:11,162 --> 00:52:11,955
There is...

694
00:52:12,422 --> 00:52:13,978
an opening for a job...

695
00:52:14,828 --> 00:52:16,060
away from all this...

696
00:52:16,624 --> 00:52:17,800
backbreaking work...

697
00:52:18,664 --> 00:52:20,182
at my new villa.

698
00:52:22,547 --> 00:52:23,157
Uh...

699
00:52:26,052 --> 00:52:29,037
Which of you has domestic experience?

700
00:52:33,205 --> 00:52:36,594
Ja, on second thought, I don't
really want someone else's maid.

701
00:52:37,303 --> 00:52:39,607
All those annoying
habits I have to undo.

702
00:52:45,708 --> 00:52:47,106
I don't want to give you my cold.

703
00:52:48,789 --> 00:52:49,621
What's your name?

704
00:52:50,926 --> 00:52:52,271
-Helen Hirsch.
-What?

705
00:52:53,255 --> 00:52:54,280
Helen Hirsch.

706
00:52:55,023 --> 00:52:55,900
What? I can't hear.

707
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:58,199
Helen Hirsch.

708
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:15,726
Ja.

709
00:53:16,076 --> 00:53:17,408
Take it all down!

710
00:53:18,371 --> 00:53:19,779
To work!

711
00:53:22,822 --> 00:53:24,511
Take it down!
It is not safe!

712
00:53:24,572 --> 00:53:27,499
She says the foundation was poured wrong.
She's got to take it down.

713
00:53:27,629 --> 00:53:30,599
I told her it's the barracks,
not the fucking Hotel Europa.

714
00:53:30,803 --> 00:53:34,618
Fucking Jew bitch engineer.
You fucking bitch!

715
00:53:35,012 --> 00:53:36,272
Herr Kommandant.

716
00:53:37,472 --> 00:53:39,114
The entire foundation

717
00:53:39,405 --> 00:53:42,024
has to be torn
down and re-poured.

718
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:45,617
If not, there will be
at least a subsidence

719
00:53:46,077 --> 00:53:47,657
at the southern end of the barracks.

720
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:49,367
Subsidence,

721
00:53:49,875 --> 00:53:51,036
and then collapse.

722
00:53:51,111 --> 00:53:53,113
-And you are an engineer?
-Yes.

723
00:53:53,947 --> 00:53:55,369
My name is Diana Reiter.

724
00:53:55,449 --> 00:53:58,874
I'm a graduate of civil engineering
from the University of Milan.

725
00:53:58,952 --> 00:54:02,310
An educated Jew,
like Karl Marx himself.

726
00:54:10,881 --> 00:54:12,555
-Unterscharfuhrer!
-Jawohl? (Yes?)

727
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:15,338
Shoot her.

728
00:54:16,068 --> 00:54:16,848
What?

729
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:19,760
Herr Kommandant,

730
00:54:20,806 --> 00:54:22,977
I'm only trying to do my job.

731
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,080
Ja, I'm doing mine.

732
00:54:24,686 --> 00:54:26,465
But, sir, she's
foreman of construction.

733
00:54:27,207 --> 00:54:29,364
We are not going to have
arguments with these people.

734
00:54:30,219 --> 00:54:30,792
Okay.

735
00:54:33,267 --> 00:54:35,916
No. Shoot her here,
on my authority.

736
00:54:47,975 --> 00:54:49,678
It will take more than that.

737
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:51,096
I'm sure you're right.

738
00:54:59,259 --> 00:55:01,143
Take it down, re-pour it,

739
00:55:01,497 --> 00:55:02,410
rebuild it.

740
00:55:02,681 --> 00:55:03,798
Like she said.

741
00:55:04,507 --> 00:55:07,233
We have more to see, but we have
only one more hour of light.

742
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:21,363
Today is history.

743
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:25,964
Today will be remembered.

744
00:55:27,961 --> 00:55:29,313
Years from now,

745
00:55:30,394 --> 00:55:33,621
the young will ask with
wonder about this day.

746
00:55:35,538 --> 00:55:37,916
Today is history,
and you are part of it.

747
00:55:40,846 --> 00:55:42,715
Six hundred years ago,

748
00:55:43,369 --> 00:55:44,522
when elsewhere they were

749
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:46,229
footing the blame for the Black Death,

750
00:55:47,351 --> 00:55:48,663
Kazimierz the Great...

751
00:55:49,452 --> 00:55:50,384
...so-called,

752
00:55:51,284 --> 00:55:54,064
told the Jews they
could come to Krakow.

753
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:56,221
They came.

754
00:55:56,567 --> 00:55:57,453
Not that fat. No, less.

755
00:55:57,514 --> 00:56:00,096
They trundled their
belongings into the city.

756
00:56:00,157 --> 00:56:01,060
Yes, a bit less.

757
00:56:01,121 --> 00:56:02,168
They settled.

758
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,377
They took hold.

759
00:56:05,643 --> 00:56:06,484
They prospered...

760
00:56:08,086 --> 00:56:11,312
in business, science,
education, the arts.

761
00:56:13,003 --> 00:56:14,755
They came here with nothing.

762
00:56:16,931 --> 00:56:17,793
Nothing.

763
00:56:19,468 --> 00:56:20,811
And they flourished.

764
00:56:22,346 --> 00:56:26,897
For six centuries there
has been a Jewish Krakow.

765
00:56:28,477 --> 00:56:29,569
Think about that.

766
00:56:31,002 --> 00:56:32,056
By this evening,

767
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:36,035
those six centuries are a rumour.

768
00:56:38,325 --> 00:56:39,377
They never happened.

769
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:43,012
Today is history.

770
00:57:04,722 --> 00:57:08,617
Absitzen und in Zweierreihen antreten!
(Spread out and enter in two rows!)

771
00:57:08,924 --> 00:57:11,016
Kameraden! Schneller!
(Comrades! Quickly!)

772
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:18,215
I think we will start with Ghetto B.

773
00:57:18,276 --> 00:57:20,119
Hopp, hopp, hopp, hopp!

774
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:28,941
All right?

775
00:57:29,174 --> 00:57:30,266
Start from both sides?

776
00:57:30,455 --> 00:57:32,356
-No, no, I would like you to start there.
-The right side?

777
00:57:32,416 --> 00:57:34,422
-The right side, yeah.
-And then move around.

778
00:57:34,483 --> 00:57:35,298
All right.

779
00:57:54,367 --> 00:57:55,326
Aufmachen!
(Open!)

780
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:57,150
Lakoom.
(Get up).

781
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,900
-Mitacht la meeta. (Quite a bit).
-Bohow. (Oh).

782
00:58:07,808 --> 00:58:09,806
Hopp, hopp, hopp, hopp!

783
00:58:52,201 --> 00:58:53,807
Runterkommen!
(Come down!)

784
00:59:02,132 --> 00:59:03,637
Rauskommen, Juden!
(Get down, Jews!)

785
00:59:08,552 --> 00:59:09,457
Nach platz!
(To the square!)

786
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:20,988
Gold, Chaim!

787
00:59:21,055 --> 00:59:22,199
Platz Chodi. (Chodi Square).

788
00:59:23,273 --> 00:59:24,445
Gold, Chaim!

789
00:59:24,934 --> 00:59:26,151
Yes, Chaim Gold.

790
00:59:26,385 --> 00:59:27,160
Shoot him.

791
00:59:33,925 --> 00:59:36,264
Nie zabijaj! Nie zabijaj!
(Do not kill! Do not kill!)

792
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:39,167
Ziehen Sie warme Kleidung...
(Put warm clothes)

793
00:59:39,228 --> 00:59:40,818
an und begeben Sie sich zum Platz...
(and go to the square...)

794
00:59:41,062 --> 00:59:44,110
Keine Koffer! Keine Koffer!
(No suitcases! No suitcases!)

795
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,488
Gehen Sie durch!
(Walk through!)

796
00:59:45,549 --> 00:59:47,893
Keine Koffer! Keine Koffer!
(No suitcases! No suitcases!)

797
00:59:48,301 --> 00:59:50,696
Hey, little boy.
Wie alt bist du, he? (How old are you, eh?)

798
00:59:50,757 --> 00:59:51,368
Na, wie heist du?
(What is your name?)

799
00:59:51,429 --> 00:59:53,259
Wie heist du, eh?
(What is your name, eh?)

800
00:59:54,859 --> 00:59:56,674
Keine Koffer, hab ich gesagt!
(No suitcases, I said!)

801
00:59:57,624 --> 00:59:58,856
Packt keine Koffer! Keine Koffer!
(Do not pack suitcases! No suitcases!)

802
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,776
Ruber zum Platz Chodi!
(Go the Chodi Square!)

803
01:00:02,036 --> 01:00:03,189
Koffer hier lassen! (Leave
you suitcases here!)

804
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:05,957
Blauschein. (Blue cards)
Platz Chodi! (Chodi Square!)

805
01:00:06,337 --> 01:00:08,010
Was soll der Koffer hier?
(What is this suitcase for?)

806
01:00:08,407 --> 01:00:10,244
Alles ruber zum Platz Chodi!
(All go to Chodi Square)

807
01:00:27,918 --> 01:00:29,431
We're getting out through the sewers.

808
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:30,823
I have to check if they're clear.

809
01:00:32,315 --> 01:00:34,274
Mila, pack some things.
Nothing bigger than this.

810
01:00:34,335 --> 01:00:37,143
I can't go in the sewers. I told
you I won't go in the sewers.

811
01:00:41,646 --> 01:00:42,592
You can go.

812
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:44,505
Yes, you can.

813
01:00:47,598 --> 01:00:49,011
I won't go in the sewers.

814
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:04,057
Move! Over there!
Over there! Move!

815
01:01:04,628 --> 01:01:06,212
Your card, Jew!

816
01:01:07,152 --> 01:01:08,707
Keine Papiere, Jude!
(No papers, Jew!)

817
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:11,480
Keine Papiere, Jude!
(No papers, Jew!)

818
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:14,552
That line.

819
01:01:16,302 --> 01:01:17,490
Deine Karte!
(Your card!)

820
01:01:17,551 --> 01:01:18,888
Ich geh nicht rauf...
(I am not going up...)

821
01:01:18,949 --> 01:01:20,952
wegen Deiner verdammten Karte!
(because of your damn card!)

822
01:01:22,419 --> 01:01:24,579
Deine Scheis karte!
(Your shit card!)

823
01:01:43,886 --> 01:01:44,812
Was soll denn die Scheise?
(What is this shit?)

824
01:01:44,873 --> 01:01:46,087
Bist du denn verruckt geworden?
(Are you crazy?)

825
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:47,056
Mit diesem Scheisgewehr...
(With this gun...)

826
01:01:47,117 --> 01:01:48,636
hattest du mich erschiesen konnen!
you could have killed me!)

827
01:01:48,697 --> 01:01:50,782
Du hast so nah an mir vorbeigeschossen!
(You were so close to me!)

828
01:01:51,566 --> 01:01:52,542
Was heist hier Entschuldigung?
(What is the excuse here?)

829
01:01:52,603 --> 01:01:53,617
Du bist wohl Verruckt ge Worden!
(You're probably crazy!)

830
01:01:53,896 --> 01:01:55,336
Zuruckbleiben! Zuruckbleiben!
(Stay back! Stay back!)

831
01:02:01,101 --> 01:02:02,636
Nicht sprechen, nicht sprechen!
(Do not speak, do not speak!)

832
01:02:02,697 --> 01:02:04,204
Einfach zu den Lastwagen gehen!
(Just go to the trucks!)

833
01:02:05,006 --> 01:02:05,674
Weiterlaufen!
(Continue running!)

834
01:02:05,735 --> 01:02:07,737
Weiterlaufen! Nicht sprechen
(Continue running! Do not speak!)

835
01:02:17,659 --> 01:02:19,506
Komm her, du Judensau!
(Come here, you Jewish pig!)

836
01:02:19,922 --> 01:02:21,799
Bleib stehen, hab ich gesagt. Bleib stehen!
(Stay, I said. Stay!)

837
01:02:27,961 --> 01:02:29,437
Chodzcie tu szybko!
(Walk here fast!)

838
01:03:19,554 --> 01:03:21,684
She's good as dead.
Leave her.

839
01:03:22,612 --> 01:03:25,310
Give me a moment.
Just let me bring her inside.

840
01:03:31,294 --> 01:03:32,248
You can join her...

841
01:03:33,506 --> 01:03:34,559
or join the line.

842
01:03:39,783 --> 01:03:40,884
Women to the left!

843
01:03:40,945 --> 01:03:41,807
-Wilhelm!
-Rose!

844
01:03:42,048 --> 01:03:44,291
Men to right. Women to the left.

845
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:45,806
Women to the left.

846
01:03:45,886 --> 01:03:48,221
Let me go! I won't leave my husband!

847
01:03:52,796 --> 01:03:53,481
Women to the left,

848
01:03:53,561 --> 01:03:54,309
Promise me, be safe.

849
01:03:54,615 --> 01:03:56,083
and men to the right.

850
01:03:58,813 --> 01:04:00,781
Your government is
in the wrong country!

851
01:04:07,769 --> 01:04:09,316
Mama! Mama!

852
01:04:57,684 --> 01:04:58,378
Mila!

853
01:05:32,848 --> 01:05:34,556
You have a Blauschein (Blue card).

854
01:05:34,617 --> 01:05:35,855
Blauschein (Blue card)
doesn't matter anymore,

855
01:05:35,916 --> 01:05:37,320
they are cleaning out the ghetto.

856
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,947
There is not enough room for you.

857
01:05:39,008 --> 01:05:40,065
What are you talking about?

858
01:05:40,126 --> 01:05:42,451
We tried it before. There's
more than enough room.

859
01:05:42,908 --> 01:05:44,714
I changed my mind!

860
01:05:44,775 --> 01:05:45,681
Mama!

861
01:05:45,742 --> 01:05:47,937
Oh, look at the space in there.

862
01:05:47,998 --> 01:05:50,251
Now look at me.
You are just scared.

863
01:05:50,312 --> 01:05:52,521
I can fit the girl, but not you.

864
01:05:52,582 --> 01:05:54,014
Mama, I'm coming out!

865
01:05:54,214 --> 01:05:55,068
Stay where you are.

866
01:05:55,129 --> 01:05:57,212
I'd rather you be here
than who knows where.

867
01:05:57,295 --> 01:05:58,304
Mama!

868
01:06:19,872 --> 01:06:21,252
Herr Kommandant!

869
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:23,422
Very good saluting.

870
01:06:23,863 --> 01:06:25,967
I respectfully report
I've been given orders

871
01:06:26,028 --> 01:06:27,370
to clear the bundles from the road,

872
01:06:27,909 --> 01:06:30,339
so there will be no obstructions
to the thoroughfare.

873
01:06:31,037 --> 01:06:33,518
Finish and join the
lines, little Polish...

874
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,713
clicking soldier.

875
01:06:58,982 --> 01:07:00,086
Mrs. Dresner?

876
01:07:00,409 --> 01:07:01,188
Yes.

877
01:07:02,235 --> 01:07:04,408
Oh, you are a friend of my son's.

878
01:07:04,654 --> 01:07:07,077
Don't worry, I'll go quietly.
I'll be no trouble.

879
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:08,905
No, get under the stairs.

880
01:07:08,979 --> 01:07:11,623
They'll be done searching soon.
You'll be safe there.

881
01:07:11,703 --> 01:07:13,250
Please hide. Please.

882
01:07:13,371 --> 01:07:14,525
...warmed by the sun.

883
01:07:14,998 --> 01:07:16,573
Hide under the stairs.

884
01:07:20,628 --> 01:07:22,648
I've searched the building.
There's no one here.

885
01:07:23,131 --> 01:07:25,429
Also, gehen wir zum nachsten Block.
(So, let's go to the next block).

886
01:07:25,508 --> 01:07:26,760
Einverstanden.
(Agreed).

887
01:07:33,141 --> 01:07:34,580
Danka!
Mama!

888
01:07:41,193 --> 01:07:42,093
Hello, Adam.

889
01:07:43,929 --> 01:07:45,177
Hello, Danka.

890
01:07:51,659 --> 01:07:54,012
Come with me. I will
put you in the good line.

891
01:07:57,350 --> 01:08:00,216
Do you know the saying, 'An
hour of life is still life'?

892
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:04,262
You are not a boy anymore.
I'm saying a blessing for you.

893
01:09:42,353 --> 01:09:45,152
Oh, please, let's go.
Let's go, please.

894
01:09:46,357 --> 01:09:47,019
Come on.

895
01:10:56,398 --> 01:10:57,287
Markieren.
(Mark here)

896
01:10:58,147 --> 01:10:59,114
Markieren.
(Mark here)

897
01:11:52,692 --> 01:11:54,132
Nie! Prosze pana, niech pan...
(No! Please, sir...)

898
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:02,197
...nie znajdziemy!
(... we will not find it!)

899
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:30,413
Was ist das? Ist das Bach?
(What is this? Is it Bach?)

900
01:12:30,474 --> 01:12:31,546
Nein, nein. Mozart.
(No, no. Mozart)

901
01:12:31,772 --> 01:12:32,943
-Mozart?
-Ja. (Yes).

902
01:12:53,782 --> 01:12:54,883
Das wollen wir heute noch schaffen?
(We still want to do that today?)

903
01:12:55,004 --> 01:12:56,053
Nee, schaffen wir nie.
(No, we never allow proximity).

904
01:13:01,886 --> 01:13:03,684
Nee, schaffen wir nie.
(No, we never allow proximity).

905
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:05,817
I wish this fucking night were over.

906
01:13:44,875 --> 01:13:47,048
Appell! Funferreihen!
(Roll call! Rows of five!)

907
01:13:49,194 --> 01:13:50,195
Antreten!
(Line up)

908
01:13:53,187 --> 01:13:55,522
Halt, alle anstellen!
(Stop, everbody stop!)

909
01:13:58,332 --> 01:14:00,703
Los, los, Funferreihen!
(Go, go, rows of five!)

910
01:14:02,128 --> 01:14:03,596
Mutzen ab!
(Hats off!)

911
01:14:05,837 --> 01:14:07,430
Namen verlesen!
(Read the names!)

912
01:14:07,576 --> 01:14:09,499
Wer aufgerufen wird, hebt seine hand...
(Whoever is called raises his hand...)

913
01:14:09,592 --> 01:14:12,050
und ein deutliches Jawohl!
(with a clear yes!)

914
01:14:12,111 --> 01:14:12,885
Jawohl.
(Yes).

915
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:19,588
-Keller, Fanni!
-Jawohl. (Yes).

916
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:25,020
-Adalbert, Hermann!
-Jawohl. (Yes).

917
01:14:25,673 --> 01:14:27,648
-Faber, Dorothea!
-Jawohl. (Yes).

918
01:14:27,815 --> 01:14:30,074
-Goldstein, Pola!
-Jawohl. (Yes).

919
01:14:31,388 --> 01:14:34,794
-Warmberger, Markus!
-Jawohl. (Yes).

920
01:14:36,188 --> 01:14:38,527
Edelstein, Max!

921
01:14:57,030 --> 01:14:58,942
Appell antreten!
(Roll call over!)

922
01:14:59,641 --> 01:15:00,642
Do pracy!
(To work!)

923
01:15:01,547 --> 01:15:04,016
The worst is over.
We are workers now.

924
01:15:36,646 --> 01:15:38,273
Keine Mudigkeit vorschutzen!
(Do not pretend tiredness!)

925
01:15:43,589 --> 01:15:47,014
Oh, God, Amon.

926
01:15:51,764 --> 01:15:54,134
Sofort in der Baracke zuruckmelden!
(Return to the barracks immediately!)

927
01:16:38,626 --> 01:16:41,238
Komm du mal schon her! Komm du schon!
(You come here in order! Come here in order.)

928
01:16:41,397 --> 01:16:42,807
Na komm! Na komm!
(Now come! Now come!)

929
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:49,795
Amon, you're such a
damned fucking child!

930
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:51,080
Wakey, wakey.

931
01:17:02,006 --> 01:17:03,006
Make coffee.

932
01:17:03,499 --> 01:17:04,749
Make it yourself.

933
01:17:20,811 --> 01:17:23,280
The SS will manage certain
industries itself

934
01:17:23,475 --> 01:17:24,463
inside Plaszow.

935
01:17:25,274 --> 01:17:27,407
A metalworks, brush factory,

936
01:17:27,776 --> 01:17:30,261
another for reprocessing
Jewish clothing

937
01:17:30,322 --> 01:17:33,739
from the ghettos for use by
bombed-out families back home.

938
01:17:33,972 --> 01:17:37,458
But it's private industry like
yours that stands to benefit most

939
01:17:37,536 --> 01:17:39,740
by moving inside the wire of
Commandant Amon Goeth's camp...

940
01:17:39,801 --> 01:17:42,375
No, no, no. Sit, sit.
Julian, how are you?

941
01:17:42,458 --> 01:17:43,784
Good to see you, my friend.

942
01:17:43,886 --> 01:17:45,754
-Oskar Schindler.
-Leo John.

943
01:17:51,175 --> 01:17:52,234
Franz, good to see you.

944
01:17:52,295 --> 01:17:53,638
Hello, Oskar.
Glad you could join us.

945
01:17:53,699 --> 01:17:54,777
My pleasure. My pleasure.

946
01:17:54,866 --> 01:17:57,078
-Julius. How are you? Good, good.
-You lost weight.

947
01:17:57,139 --> 01:17:59,976
Only in the shoulders. Please,
everybody, sit down. Sit down.

948
01:18:01,435 --> 01:18:03,183
How are you doing?
Oskar Schindler.

949
01:18:05,833 --> 01:18:06,940
We started without you.

950
01:18:07,207 --> 01:18:09,013
Fine. I Miss anything good?

951
01:18:09,818 --> 01:18:12,516
I was explaining to Herr Bosch
and Herr Madritsch

952
01:18:12,577 --> 01:18:15,416
some of the benefits of moving
their factories into Plaszow.

953
01:18:15,491 --> 01:18:16,503
I meant the food.

954
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:22,252
Since your labour
is housed on-site,

955
01:18:22,346 --> 01:18:24,093
it's available to you at all times.

956
01:18:24,416 --> 01:18:26,391
You can work them
all night if you want.

957
01:18:27,169 --> 01:18:28,689
Your factory policies,

958
01:18:28,756 --> 01:18:31,358
whatever they've been in the
past, they'll continue to be.

959
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:33,189
They'll be respected.

960
01:18:34,077 --> 01:18:36,203
I have to know, where do
you get a suit like that?

961
01:18:36,567 --> 01:18:38,077
What is that? Is that silk?

962
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:39,004
Of course.

963
01:18:40,708 --> 01:18:41,321
Ja.

964
01:18:42,309 --> 01:18:43,710
It has a nice sheen about it.

965
01:18:44,629 --> 01:18:45,268
Thank you.

966
01:18:45,562 --> 01:18:46,331
Very nice.

967
01:18:46,855 --> 01:18:49,436
I'd say I'd get you one, but the
man who made it is probably dead.

968
01:18:50,308 --> 01:18:51,065
I don't know.

969
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:55,096
I go to work the other day.

970
01:18:56,705 --> 01:18:57,732
Nobody's there.

971
01:18:58,930 --> 01:19:02,560
Nobody tells me about this. I have
to find out. I have to go in.

972
01:19:03,816 --> 01:19:05,000
Everybody's gone.

973
01:19:06,166 --> 01:19:06,828
No.

974
01:19:09,169 --> 01:19:09,758
No.

975
01:19:14,091 --> 01:19:15,217
They're not gone.

976
01:19:15,909 --> 01:19:16,560
They're here.

977
01:19:16,635 --> 01:19:17,678
They're mine!

978
01:19:20,552 --> 01:19:22,058
Every day that goes
by, I'm losing money.

979
01:19:22,119 --> 01:19:23,931
Every worker that is
shot costs me money.

980
01:19:23,992 --> 01:19:25,768
I have to find somebody else.
I have to train them.

981
01:19:25,829 --> 01:19:27,526
We are going to be making so much money

982
01:19:27,587 --> 01:19:28,637
that none of this is going to matter.

983
01:19:28,698 --> 01:19:30,113
It's bad business.

984
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:44,574
Thank you.

985
01:19:45,572 --> 01:19:46,331
Leave the bottle.

986
01:19:48,959 --> 01:19:49,606
Take that.

987
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:52,336
Lena,

988
01:19:53,736 --> 01:19:54,418
thank you.

989
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:06,423
Scherner told me something
else about you.

990
01:20:09,563 --> 01:20:10,957
Yeah? What's that?

991
01:20:12,051 --> 01:20:14,047
That you know the meaning of the word

992
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:15,614
'gratitude.'

993
01:20:17,404 --> 01:20:20,283
That it's not some vague thing with you

994
01:20:20,366 --> 01:20:22,554
like it is with others.

995
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:26,089
You want to stay where you are.

996
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:29,662
You've got things going on the side.

997
01:20:30,587 --> 01:20:31,702
Things are good.

998
01:20:32,711 --> 01:20:35,994
You don't want anybody
telling you what to do.

999
01:20:37,174 --> 01:20:39,143
I can understand all that, you know.

1000
01:20:39,914 --> 01:20:40,663
I know you.

1001
01:20:43,722 --> 01:20:44,680
What you want...

1002
01:20:45,907 --> 01:20:48,080
is your own sub-camp.

1003
01:20:54,525 --> 01:20:56,312
Do you have any idea what is involved?

1004
01:20:57,098 --> 01:20:59,603
The paperwork alone, and then you've
got to build the fucking thing.

1005
01:20:59,664 --> 01:21:02,037
Getting the fucking permits
is enough to drive you crazy.

1006
01:21:02,199 --> 01:21:03,325
Then the engineers show up,

1007
01:21:03,386 --> 01:21:06,078
they stand around, they argue
about drainage, foundations,

1008
01:21:06,181 --> 01:21:07,865
codes, exact specifications,

1009
01:21:07,955 --> 01:21:09,753
parallel fences four kilometres long,

1010
01:21:09,873 --> 01:21:11,650
1,200 kilograms of barbed wire,

1011
01:21:11,849 --> 01:21:15,073
6,000 kilograms of electrified
fences, ceramic insulators,

1012
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:17,010
three cubic meters of
air space per prisoner.

1013
01:21:17,071 --> 01:21:18,443
I'm telling you, you
want to shoot somebody.

1014
01:21:18,504 --> 01:21:20,181
I've been through it, you know? I know.

1015
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:22,424
Well, you know. You've been through it.

1016
01:21:26,849 --> 01:21:28,621
You could make things easier for me.

1017
01:21:32,811 --> 01:21:33,909
I'd be grateful.

1018
01:21:39,042 --> 01:21:40,117
Aus dem Weg da!
(Out of the way!)

1019
01:21:50,367 --> 01:21:52,358
Weitergehen! Weitergehen!
(Keep moving! Keep moving!)

1020
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:11,083
Where's Stern?

1021
01:22:15,731 --> 01:22:17,176
Goldberg and Chilowicz,

1022
01:22:17,995 --> 01:22:19,952
make sure I see my cut

1023
01:22:20,027 --> 01:22:22,935
from the factory owners in this camp.

1024
01:22:23,555 --> 01:22:26,655
Leaving you to take care
of my main account,

1025
01:22:26,992 --> 01:22:29,459
the Schindler account.

1026
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:31,849
He wants his independence.

1027
01:22:32,626 --> 01:22:33,613
I gave it to him.

1028
01:22:34,638 --> 01:22:36,432
But independence costs money.

1029
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:38,874
This, you understand?

1030
01:22:45,004 --> 01:22:45,795
Look at me.

1031
01:22:57,648 --> 01:22:59,959
Don't forget who you
are working for now.

1032
01:23:09,824 --> 01:23:10,569
Jawohl!

1033
01:23:10,953 --> 01:23:13,188
Make sure he stays. He's
a slippery bastard!

1034
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:22,552
We need more wine.

1035
01:23:22,613 --> 01:23:23,291
More wine!

1036
01:23:24,017 --> 01:23:26,097
Stand on my friend.
Don't let him leave.

1037
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:45,227
Was passiert denn in meinem Leben
(What happens in my life)

1038
01:23:45,288 --> 01:23:46,160
Prost! Prost!
(Cheers! Cheers!)

1039
01:23:50,033 --> 01:23:51,549
Thank you, Herr Direktor.

1040
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:52,627
Prost, Herr Direktor!

1041
01:23:57,958 --> 01:23:58,831
What are you doing?

1042
01:23:59,268 --> 01:24:00,830
What? Scratching my head.

1043
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:04,594
Makes them think we have lice. Helps
make them keep their distance.

1044
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:07,931
-Do you have lice?
-Do you have your notebook?

1045
01:24:08,594 --> 01:24:10,471
The calendar on my
desk has the birthdays

1046
01:24:10,532 --> 01:24:12,187
of our SS friends' wives and children.

1047
01:24:12,514 --> 01:24:13,936
Don't forget to send something.

1048
01:24:15,065 --> 01:24:16,937
Record pay-offs to the
Main Administration

1049
01:24:16,998 --> 01:24:18,650
and Economics Office, the Arm...

1050
01:24:18,711 --> 01:24:19,863
Slowly, Stern, slowly.

1051
01:24:19,938 --> 01:24:23,074
The Armaments Board, Governor
General's Division of the Interior

1052
01:24:23,135 --> 01:24:25,296
and Chief of Police as 'fees.'

1053
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:27,700
And make them on the
first of each month,

1054
01:24:27,779 --> 01:24:30,282
as opposed to individual
pay-offs to our SS contacts.

1055
01:24:30,365 --> 01:24:32,559
The list is in the lower drawer
of my desk, which you...

1056
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:34,369
'First of month...'

1057
01:24:35,621 --> 01:24:38,231
SS contacts list, lower drawer
of my desk, which you handle

1058
01:24:38,292 --> 01:24:40,486
as cash contributions
to legitimate charities

1059
01:24:40,547 --> 01:24:42,406
sent, of course, to
each official's office.

1060
01:24:42,753 --> 01:24:45,174
Dealings with our black market contacts

1061
01:24:45,235 --> 01:24:47,804
listed as suppliers in
the legitimate ledger

1062
01:24:47,865 --> 01:24:49,392
-are more complicated.
-Forget it.

1063
01:24:49,492 --> 01:24:50,659
What do you mean, forget it?
You can't forget it.

1064
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,686
It gives me a headache.
It gives me a headache!

1065
01:25:00,562 --> 01:25:02,099
-I couldn't get you out of here.
-I'll be all right.

1066
01:25:03,899 --> 01:25:06,149
Anyway, I'm here almost every week.

1067
01:25:07,209 --> 01:25:08,196
Wednesdays, usually.

1068
01:25:08,737 --> 01:25:09,847
I'll look in on you,

1069
01:25:09,983 --> 01:25:10,887
see how you're doing.

1070
01:25:13,742 --> 01:25:14,414
Here,

1071
01:25:15,597 --> 01:25:16,490
put these in your pocket.

1072
01:25:17,441 --> 01:25:18,054
Come on.

1073
01:25:23,669 --> 01:25:25,421
Herr Direktor,
don't let things fall apart.

1074
01:25:25,482 --> 01:25:26,562
I've worked too hard.

1075
01:25:36,264 --> 01:25:37,222
Thanks for...

1076
01:25:39,029 --> 01:25:39,742
Good luck.

1077
01:26:02,452 --> 01:26:04,805
Achtung, Mutzen ab!
(Attention, hats off!)

1078
01:26:15,009 --> 01:26:16,636
-Work!
-An die Arbeit! (Get to work!)

1079
01:26:31,695 --> 01:26:32,784
What are you making?

1080
01:26:33,428 --> 01:26:34,222
Hinges, sir.

1081
01:26:38,562 --> 01:26:40,861
I've got some
workers coming in tomorrow.

1082
01:26:40,922 --> 01:26:42,130
Where the hell they from again?

1083
01:26:42,205 --> 01:26:43,526
Yugoslavia, Herr Kommandant.

1084
01:26:44,347 --> 01:26:45,675
I've got to make room.

1085
01:26:49,171 --> 01:26:50,875
Make me a hinge.

1086
01:26:51,435 --> 01:26:52,258
Yes, sir.

1087
01:27:24,581 --> 01:27:25,909
Keep going, you're doing well.

1088
01:27:35,956 --> 01:27:37,573
Oh, that's very good.

1089
01:27:38,804 --> 01:27:42,123
But I'm a bit confused,
and perhaps you can help me.

1090
01:27:42,694 --> 01:27:44,613
What I don't understand is...

1091
01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:46,333
that you've been working

1092
01:27:46,394 --> 01:27:48,064
since I think, what, about...

1093
01:27:48,917 --> 01:27:50,010
6:00 this morning?

1094
01:27:51,441 --> 01:27:52,063
Yet,

1095
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:55,722
such a small pile of hinges.

1096
01:28:25,737 --> 01:28:27,488
-Oh, Christ.
-May I try that, sir?

1097
01:28:28,103 --> 01:28:29,856
Check the angle lever.
Maybe it's bent.

1098
01:28:30,070 --> 01:28:33,329
No, no. You wouldn't hear a click
if the angle lever hits the pin.

1099
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:35,625
Maybe it's the pin.
Maybe the pin shaft is greasy.

1100
01:28:35,686 --> 01:28:36,265
Ja, come on.

1101
01:28:36,326 --> 01:28:37,573
What did I just say? Here.

1102
01:28:42,367 --> 01:28:43,530
Herr Kommandant.

1103
01:28:43,869 --> 01:28:46,680
I beg to report that
my heap of hinges...

1104
01:28:47,227 --> 01:28:49,075
was so unsatisfactory

1105
01:28:49,708 --> 01:28:51,172
because the machines

1106
01:28:51,332 --> 01:28:53,487
were being recalibrated this morning.

1107
01:28:55,481 --> 01:28:58,178
I was put on to shovelling coal.

1108
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:23,054
Strange, huh?

1109
01:29:24,558 --> 01:29:25,211
Yeah.

1110
01:29:30,999 --> 01:29:31,986
Thank you, Muek.

1111
01:29:34,502 --> 01:29:35,410
Ah, Lisiek.

1112
01:29:35,881 --> 01:29:37,822
Don't touch the leather,
it's just been oiled.

1113
01:29:38,214 --> 01:29:39,890
-Rottenfuhrer.
-Oh, for me?

1114
01:29:39,951 --> 01:29:41,439
Oh, thank you very much, Herr Direktor.

1115
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:42,552
Herr Direktor!

1116
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:45,407
Herr Direktor!

1117
01:29:49,023 --> 01:29:49,925
Herr Direktor.

1118
01:29:53,355 --> 01:29:54,777
He was making hinges slowly.

1119
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:56,390
So the man can turn out a hinge in

1120
01:29:56,451 --> 01:29:58,419
less than a minute.
Why the long story?

1121
01:29:59,234 --> 01:29:59,971
Hmm?

1122
01:30:28,723 --> 01:30:29,835
Thank you, sir.

1123
01:30:30,251 --> 01:30:31,081
You're welcome.

1124
01:30:35,188 --> 01:30:37,701
Nobody knows who
stole the chicken, hmm?

1125
01:30:38,426 --> 01:30:39,158
Tell him about the chicken.

1126
01:30:39,219 --> 01:30:42,738
A man walks around with a chicken
and nobody notices this.

1127
01:30:43,822 --> 01:30:44,909
Save yourselves.

1128
01:30:46,636 --> 01:30:47,750
Tell him about the chicken.

1129
01:31:04,589 --> 01:31:05,876
Still nobody knows.

1130
01:31:18,273 --> 01:31:19,142
It was you.

1131
01:31:20,502 --> 01:31:22,028
You committed this crime.

1132
01:31:22,110 --> 01:31:22,760
No, sir.

1133
01:31:22,821 --> 01:31:23,947
But you know who, though.

1134
01:31:24,630 --> 01:31:25,940
-Yes.
-Who?

1135
01:31:27,889 --> 01:31:28,727
Him!

1136
01:31:34,003 --> 01:31:34,818
He's very gifted.

1137
01:31:34,879 --> 01:31:36,624
Yeah, sure.
Bring him over.

1138
01:31:40,462 --> 01:31:41,092
Sir.

1139
01:31:43,239 --> 01:31:44,251
Thank you.

1140
01:31:50,259 --> 01:31:51,636
Thank you again, Herr Direktor.

1141
01:31:51,741 --> 01:31:52,945
You're welcome again.

1142
01:31:53,218 --> 01:31:55,644
It's an honour to work for
such a great company.

1143
01:31:55,727 --> 01:31:56,728
It's great to have you.

1144
01:31:56,811 --> 01:32:00,537
I promise to learn everything there is
to know about enamelware production.

1145
01:32:00,598 --> 01:32:01,378
That's great.

1146
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:14,582
Hello?

1147
01:32:15,811 --> 01:32:17,466
-Miss Elsa Krause is here.
-I only need five minutes.

1148
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:19,064
She wants to speak to
the Herr Direktor.

1149
01:32:40,855 --> 01:32:41,451
Yes.

1150
01:32:46,786 --> 01:32:48,038
He won't see you.

1151
01:33:19,394 --> 01:33:20,640
Please, sit down.

1152
01:33:24,816 --> 01:33:25,848
Pernod? Cognac?

1153
01:33:26,073 --> 01:33:27,686
No. No, thank you.

1154
01:33:28,976 --> 01:33:31,217
So, what can I do for you?

1155
01:33:36,786 --> 01:33:38,391
They say that no one dies here.

1156
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:41,167
They say your factory is a haven.

1157
01:33:44,377 --> 01:33:45,534
They say you are good.

1158
01:33:49,632 --> 01:33:50,474
Who says that?

1159
01:33:51,993 --> 01:33:52,814
Everyone.

1160
01:34:00,518 --> 01:34:02,963
My name is Regina
Perlman, not Elsa Krause.

1161
01:34:03,223 --> 01:34:06,271
I've been living in Krakow on false
papers since the ghetto massacre.

1162
01:34:06,691 --> 01:34:08,251
My parents are in Plaszow.

1163
01:34:08,735 --> 01:34:12,726
Their names are Chana
and Jakob Perlman.

1164
01:34:13,114 --> 01:34:14,271
They are older people.

1165
01:34:14,507 --> 01:34:16,744
They are killing older
people now in Plaszow.

1166
01:34:16,826 --> 01:34:19,080
They bury them up in the forest. Look,

1167
01:34:21,585 --> 01:34:22,756
I don't have any money.

1168
01:34:23,917 --> 01:34:26,578
I borrowed these clothes.

1169
01:34:29,797 --> 01:34:30,866
I'm begging you.

1170
01:34:31,861 --> 01:34:32,486
Please.

1171
01:34:33,968 --> 01:34:35,219
Please bring them here.

1172
01:34:35,595 --> 01:34:36,877
I don't do that.

1173
01:34:38,264 --> 01:34:39,446
You've been misled.

1174
01:34:40,746 --> 01:34:41,843
I ask one thing.

1175
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:43,903
Whether or not the worker
has certain skills.

1176
01:34:44,077 --> 01:34:45,576
That's what I ask and
that's what I care about.

1177
01:34:45,637 --> 01:34:47,873
My father is an importer,
not a metalworker.

1178
01:34:48,024 --> 01:34:51,471
Such activities are illegal.
You will not entrap me!

1179
01:34:53,112 --> 01:34:54,935
Cry, and I will have you arrested.

1180
01:34:55,105 --> 01:34:56,205
I swear to God!

1181
01:35:06,376 --> 01:35:08,692
People die.
It's a fact of life.

1182
01:35:09,290 --> 01:35:11,207
He wants to kill everybody?
Great!

1183
01:35:11,268 --> 01:35:12,815
What am I supposed to do about it?

1184
01:35:13,091 --> 01:35:15,595
Bring everybody over?
Is that what you think?

1185
01:35:15,927 --> 01:35:18,771
Send them over to Schindler.
Send them all!

1186
01:35:18,912 --> 01:35:22,802
His place is a haven, didn't you know?
It's not a factory.

1187
01:35:22,863 --> 01:35:24,903
It's not an enterprise of any kind.

1188
01:35:24,978 --> 01:35:27,822
It's a haven for rabbis and orphans

1189
01:35:27,897 --> 01:35:30,283
and people with no skills whatsoever!

1190
01:35:33,695 --> 01:35:35,396
You think I don't
know what you're doing?

1191
01:35:36,186 --> 01:35:38,269
You're so quiet all the time.

1192
01:35:38,344 --> 01:35:39,598
I know, I know!

1193
01:35:39,659 --> 01:35:41,227
-Are you losing money?
-No I'm not losing money.

1194
01:35:41,288 --> 01:35:42,124
That's not the point!

1195
01:35:42,203 --> 01:35:42,769
So the point is?

1196
01:35:42,830 --> 01:35:45,873
It's dangerous!
It's dangerous to me!

1197
01:35:50,532 --> 01:35:54,002
You have to understand. Goeth
is under enormous pressure.

1198
01:35:54,132 --> 01:35:56,074
You have to think of
it in his situation.

1199
01:35:58,096 --> 01:35:59,742
He's got this whole place to run.

1200
01:36:00,471 --> 01:36:03,315
He's responsible for everything
here, all these people.

1201
01:36:03,391 --> 01:36:05,033
He's got a lot of
things to worry about.

1202
01:36:07,048 --> 01:36:08,604
And he's got the war

1203
01:36:09,098 --> 01:36:10,736
which brings out the worst in people.

1204
01:36:10,815 --> 01:36:14,031
Never the good, always the bad.
Always the bad.

1205
01:36:16,490 --> 01:36:20,597
But in normal circumstances he wouldn't
be like this. He'd be all right.

1206
01:36:21,409 --> 01:36:24,175
There'd just be the good
aspects of him, which...

1207
01:36:25,663 --> 01:36:27,753
He's a wonderful crook.

1208
01:36:28,391 --> 01:36:33,085
A man who loves good food, good
wine, the ladies, making money...

1209
01:36:33,146 --> 01:36:33,724
Killing.

1210
01:36:35,511 --> 01:36:36,662
He can't enjoy it.

1211
01:36:38,301 --> 01:36:41,680
Bejski told me the other day,
somebody escaped

1212
01:36:41,818 --> 01:36:43,871
from a work detail outside the wire.

1213
01:36:44,599 --> 01:36:47,463
Goeth lined up everybody from
the missing man's barracks.

1214
01:36:48,269 --> 01:36:50,275
He shot the man to the left of Bejski,

1215
01:36:50,501 --> 01:36:51,775
the man to the right of him.

1216
01:36:52,106 --> 01:36:54,780
He walked down the line shooting
every other man with a pistol.

1217
01:37:01,712 --> 01:37:02,532
Twenty-five.

1218
01:37:07,829 --> 01:37:09,229
What do you want me to do about it?

1219
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:10,194
Nothing, nothing.

1220
01:37:11,628 --> 01:37:12,536
We're just talking.

1221
01:37:26,026 --> 01:37:26,763
'Perlman.'

1222
01:37:29,310 --> 01:37:30,607
Perlman!

1223
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:33,296
Husband and wife.

1224
01:37:34,107 --> 01:37:37,433
Jakob and Chana Perlman!

1225
01:37:50,965 --> 01:37:52,260
Have Goldberg bring them over.

1226
01:37:56,003 --> 01:37:57,907
Mutzen ab!
(Hats off!)

1227
01:37:59,829 --> 01:38:01,797
Appell abtreten!
(At ease!)

1228
01:38:49,443 --> 01:38:52,583
I'm sure this will be better
than those rags, Lisiek.

1229
01:38:54,159 --> 01:38:57,623
Herr Direktor, I was just helping
Lisiek to find something

1230
01:38:57,684 --> 01:39:00,256
to clean the stains from the
Herr Kommandant's bathtub.

1231
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:01,377
Go clean it.

1232
01:39:01,438 --> 01:39:02,781
Pardon me, Herr Direktor.

1233
01:39:07,541 --> 01:39:09,595
You don't have to report to me, Helen.

1234
01:39:10,975 --> 01:39:12,120
You know who I am?

1235
01:39:13,014 --> 01:39:13,547
Hmm?

1236
01:39:21,751 --> 01:39:22,700
I'm Schindler.

1237
01:39:25,182 --> 01:39:27,560
Of course. I have heard, and

1238
01:39:28,971 --> 01:39:30,799
you have been here before.

1239
01:39:34,059 --> 01:39:36,211
Here, why don't you
keep this some place?

1240
01:39:36,812 --> 01:39:37,954
Go on, take it.

1241
01:39:38,811 --> 01:39:40,157
I get extra food here.

1242
01:39:40,218 --> 01:39:41,710
Well, if you don't want
to eat it, trade it.

1243
01:39:43,502 --> 01:39:44,784
Or give it to Lisiek.

1244
01:39:47,615 --> 01:39:49,091
Why not build yourself up?

1245
01:39:54,590 --> 01:39:56,218
My first day here,

1246
01:39:58,151 --> 01:40:01,517
he beat me because I threw
out the bones from dinner.

1247
01:40:05,855 --> 01:40:09,179
He came down to the basement
at midnight, and he...

1248
01:40:10,350 --> 01:40:12,086
he asked me where they were.

1249
01:40:15,603 --> 01:40:16,718
For his dogs,

1250
01:40:18,011 --> 01:40:19,293
you understand.

1251
01:40:22,397 --> 01:40:23,984
I said to him, I...

1252
01:40:25,034 --> 01:40:26,283
I don't know how I say this.

1253
01:40:26,362 --> 01:40:29,480
I never could say it
now, I said to him,

1254
01:40:30,272 --> 01:40:32,123
'Why are you beating me?'

1255
01:40:36,071 --> 01:40:38,675
He said, 'The reason I beat you now'

1256
01:40:39,832 --> 01:40:42,869
is because you ask why I beat you.'

1257
01:40:45,381 --> 01:40:47,055
I know your sufferings, Helen.

1258
01:40:50,869 --> 01:40:52,031
It doesn't matter.

1259
01:40:54,932 --> 01:40:56,788
I have accepted them.

1260
01:40:58,050 --> 01:40:58,984
Accepted them?

1261
01:41:02,014 --> 01:41:03,857
One day he will shoot me.

1262
01:41:03,918 --> 01:41:06,092
No, no, no, he won't shoot you.

1263
01:41:06,819 --> 01:41:07,679
I know.

1264
01:41:08,307 --> 01:41:09,458
I see things.

1265
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:12,278
We were on the roof on Monday,

1266
01:41:12,938 --> 01:41:15,038
young Lisiek and I, and we saw...

1267
01:41:15,418 --> 01:41:17,994
the Herr Kommandant come
out of the from door and

1268
01:41:18,595 --> 01:41:23,021
down the steps by the patio,
right there below us,

1269
01:41:23,430 --> 01:41:27,192
and there on the steps
he drew his gun and he

1270
01:41:28,154 --> 01:41:30,305
shot a woman who was passing by.

1271
01:41:32,428 --> 01:41:34,124
A woman carrying a bundle.

1272
01:41:35,010 --> 01:41:35,799
Through the throat.

1273
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:39,725
Just a woman on her way
somewhere, you know?

1274
01:41:39,786 --> 01:41:40,981
She was no...

1275
01:41:42,278 --> 01:41:43,771
fatter or thinner or...

1276
01:41:44,031 --> 01:41:45,955
slower or faster than anyone else,

1277
01:41:46,016 --> 01:41:49,596
and I couldn't guess what had she done.

1278
01:41:54,687 --> 01:41:56,009
The more you see...

1279
01:41:57,089 --> 01:42:00,014
of the Herr Kommandant, the
more you see there is no...

1280
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:03,426
set rules that you can live by.

1281
01:42:03,588 --> 01:42:07,707
You can't say to yourself, 'If I
follow these rules, I will be safe.'

1282
01:42:11,884 --> 01:42:15,040
He won't shoot you because
he enjoys you too much.

1283
01:42:16,567 --> 01:42:19,770
He enjoys you so much he won't
even let you wear the star.

1284
01:42:20,694 --> 01:42:22,370
He doesn't want anyone else to know

1285
01:42:22,431 --> 01:42:24,441
it's a Jew he's enjoying.

1286
01:42:28,737 --> 01:42:31,666
He shot the woman from the steps

1287
01:42:31,727 --> 01:42:34,518
because she meant nothing to him.

1288
01:42:36,127 --> 01:42:37,634
She was one of a series,

1289
01:42:37,695 --> 01:42:39,986
neither offending or pleasing him.

1290
01:42:44,583 --> 01:42:46,127
But you, Helen.

1291
01:42:51,494 --> 01:42:52,374
It's all right.

1292
01:42:53,361 --> 01:42:54,956
It's not that kind of a kiss.

1293
01:43:01,809 --> 01:43:02,629
Thank you.

1294
01:43:02,690 --> 01:43:03,414
Shh.

1295
01:43:09,224 --> 01:43:09,849
Here.

1296
01:43:15,883 --> 01:43:17,444
Right. The wine.

1297
01:43:25,666 --> 01:43:27,962
Wonderful party, Amon.
Thank you.

1298
01:43:37,136 --> 01:43:39,275
Why do you drink that motor oil?

1299
01:43:40,181 --> 01:43:42,333
Hmm? I send you good
stuff all the time.

1300
01:43:43,547 --> 01:43:46,520
Your liver's going to explode
like a hand grenade.

1301
01:43:47,426 --> 01:43:48,555
You know, I look at you.

1302
01:43:50,405 --> 01:43:51,411
I watch you.

1303
01:43:55,448 --> 01:43:56,413
You're never drunk.

1304
01:43:57,672 --> 01:43:58,252
Oh, that's...

1305
01:44:00,493 --> 01:44:01,839
that's real control.

1306
01:44:03,687 --> 01:44:04,881
Control is power.

1307
01:44:06,832 --> 01:44:08,112
That's power.

1308
01:44:12,922 --> 01:44:15,386
Is that why they fear us?

1309
01:44:18,242 --> 01:44:21,038
We have the fucking power to
kill, that's why they fear us.

1310
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:25,099
They fear us because we have
the power to kill arbitrarily.

1311
01:44:25,976 --> 01:44:28,012
A man commits a crime,
he should know better.

1312
01:44:28,073 --> 01:44:30,309
We have him killed, and we
feel pretty good about it.

1313
01:44:30,981 --> 01:44:33,514
Or we kill him ourselves
and we feel even better.

1314
01:44:36,070 --> 01:44:37,849
That's not power, though.

1315
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:40,375
That's justice.

1316
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:42,320
It's different than power.

1317
01:44:46,247 --> 01:44:47,098
Power...

1318
01:44:48,022 --> 01:44:50,483
is when we have every
justification to kill,

1319
01:44:51,752 --> 01:44:52,924
and we don't.

1320
01:44:54,255 --> 01:44:55,336
You think that's power?

1321
01:44:58,926 --> 01:45:00,499
That's what the emperors had.

1322
01:45:01,119 --> 01:45:02,146
A man stole something,

1323
01:45:02,221 --> 01:45:03,854
he's brought in before the emperor,

1324
01:45:03,915 --> 01:45:07,718
he throws himself down on the
ground, he begs for mercy.

1325
01:45:08,143 --> 01:45:10,266
He knows he's going to die.

1326
01:45:13,566 --> 01:45:14,616
And the emperor...

1327
01:45:15,494 --> 01:45:16,603
pardons him.

1328
01:45:18,362 --> 01:45:19,452
This worthless man.

1329
01:45:19,740 --> 01:45:20,712
He lets him go.

1330
01:45:25,213 --> 01:45:26,427
I think you are drunk.

1331
01:45:29,039 --> 01:45:30,757
That's power, Amon.

1332
01:45:32,126 --> 01:45:34,762
That is power.

1333
01:45:43,137 --> 01:45:45,504
Amon the Good.

1334
01:45:48,851 --> 01:45:49,491
I pardon you.

1335
01:45:59,364 --> 01:46:00,202
What do they want?

1336
01:46:00,321 --> 01:46:03,871
I don't know, but they're in my
office now reviewing our books.

1337
01:46:03,949 --> 01:46:05,029
As my accountant,

1338
01:46:06,179 --> 01:46:08,187
tell me, should I be
alarmed that the auditors

1339
01:46:08,248 --> 01:46:09,895
-are reviewing my books?
-Well...

1340
01:46:09,956 --> 01:46:11,478
Or have you done your job properly?

1341
01:46:11,539 --> 01:46:12,565
You needn't be alarmed.

1342
01:46:12,958 --> 01:46:14,053
I needn't be alarmed.

1343
01:46:19,495 --> 01:46:20,371
I'm sorry, sir.

1344
01:46:20,432 --> 01:46:21,760
Do you know how much
this saddle is worth?

1345
01:46:22,676 --> 01:46:23,952
Do you know how much it costs?

1346
01:46:29,993 --> 01:46:30,583
All right.

1347
01:46:33,646 --> 01:46:34,329
All right.

1348
01:46:39,145 --> 01:46:41,060
Stern, what the hell are you
doing following me around?

1349
01:46:51,927 --> 01:46:54,137
Baracken eins, elf
(Barracks one, eleven)

1350
01:46:54,198 --> 01:46:59,312
funfzehn und zwounddreisig am Appellplatz melden.
(fifteen and thirty-two at the Parade gorund).

1351
01:47:29,555 --> 01:47:30,877
She was smoking on the job.

1352
01:47:35,002 --> 01:47:36,427
Tell her not to do it again.

1353
01:47:53,225 --> 01:47:54,659
I have to report, sir.

1354
01:47:56,812 --> 01:47:59,493
I've been unable to remove
the stains from your bathtub.

1355
01:48:04,445 --> 01:48:05,762
What are you using, Lisiek?

1356
01:48:06,154 --> 01:48:07,285
Soap, Commandant.

1357
01:48:10,367 --> 01:48:12,131
Soap? Not lye?

1358
01:48:22,296 --> 01:48:24,628
Go ahead, go on, leave.
Leave, I pardon you.

1359
01:48:48,372 --> 01:48:49,331
I pardon you.

1360
01:50:42,227 --> 01:50:45,731
Although I am not a
rabbi, in these circumstances

1361
01:50:45,792 --> 01:50:48,511
I pray to the Almighty
that he will forgive me

1362
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:51,072
if I intone the blessings.

1363
01:51:44,164 --> 01:51:44,855
So...

1364
01:51:47,459 --> 01:51:49,944
This is where you come to hide from me.

1365
01:51:51,421 --> 01:51:52,875
I came to tell you

1366
01:51:54,947 --> 01:51:58,276
that you really are a wonderful cook

1367
01:51:58,337 --> 01:52:00,526
and a well-trained servant.

1368
01:52:01,682 --> 01:52:02,542
I mean it,

1369
01:52:03,762 --> 01:52:06,650
if you need a reference after the war, dear,

1370
01:52:08,955 --> 01:52:10,215
I'd be happy to give you one.

1371
01:52:12,228 --> 01:52:14,004
It must get lonely down here

1372
01:52:14,198 --> 01:52:17,354
when you're listening to everyone
upstairs having such a good time.

1373
01:52:25,161 --> 01:52:25,842
Does it?

1374
01:52:29,293 --> 01:52:30,242
You can answer.

1375
01:52:33,547 --> 01:52:35,169
But what's the right answer?

1376
01:52:35,816 --> 01:52:36,909
That's what you're thinking.

1377
01:52:38,010 --> 01:52:39,434
What does he want to hear?

1378
01:52:46,268 --> 01:52:47,062
The truth,

1379
01:52:47,642 --> 01:52:49,860
Helen, is always the right answer.

1380
01:52:53,340 --> 01:52:54,514
Yes, you're right.

1381
01:52:55,822 --> 01:52:57,074
Sometimes we're both lonely.

1382
01:52:59,452 --> 01:53:00,996
Yes. I...

1383
01:53:03,503 --> 01:53:04,054
I mean,

1384
01:53:12,682 --> 01:53:14,346
I would like so much to

1385
01:53:16,298 --> 01:53:17,203
reach out...

1386
01:53:18,453 --> 01:53:19,828
and touch you in your loneliness.

1387
01:53:20,969 --> 01:53:23,725
What would that be like,
I wonder? I mean...

1388
01:53:25,307 --> 01:53:26,867
What would be wrong with that?

1389
01:53:28,185 --> 01:53:29,868
I realize that you're not...

1390
01:53:30,697 --> 01:53:33,927
a person in the strictest
sense of the word, but...

1391
01:53:36,586 --> 01:53:39,212
No, maybe you're right about
that too, you know, maybe...

1392
01:53:39,983 --> 01:53:41,508
what's wrong isn't...

1393
01:53:43,433 --> 01:53:44,309
It's not us.

1394
01:53:46,179 --> 01:53:47,455
It's... no, it's this.

1395
01:53:50,752 --> 01:53:53,471
I mean, when they compare you to

1396
01:53:55,574 --> 01:53:58,050
vermin, and to rodents, and to lice...

1397
01:54:02,094 --> 01:54:03,047
I just...

1398
01:54:07,179 --> 01:54:09,003
No, you make a good point.

1399
01:54:10,215 --> 01:54:11,565
You make a very good point.

1400
01:54:20,987 --> 01:54:22,833
Is this the face of a rat?

1401
01:54:26,493 --> 01:54:28,806
Are these the eyes of a rat?

1402
01:54:32,316 --> 01:54:33,710
Hath not a Jew eyes?

1403
01:54:35,335 --> 01:54:39,681
Ci wszystko wybaczy
(You will forgive everything)

1404
01:54:40,715 --> 01:54:46,097
Bo milosc moj mily
(Because my love is so sweet)

1405
01:54:50,401 --> 01:54:51,403
I feel...

1406
01:54:52,963 --> 01:54:53,931
for you, Helen.

1407
01:54:58,275 --> 01:55:00,824
To ja.
(It's me.)

1408
01:55:11,323 --> 01:55:12,370
No, I don't think so.

1409
01:55:15,664 --> 01:55:16,722
You're a Jewish bitch.

1410
01:55:20,052 --> 01:55:21,611
You nearly talked me
into it, didn't you?

1411
01:55:23,137 --> 01:55:23,888
Didn't you?

1412
01:55:29,598 --> 01:55:30,532
Bravo.

1413
01:55:47,157 --> 01:55:51,253
Hoch! Hoch! Hoch!
(High! High! High!)

1414
01:55:53,914 --> 01:55:55,291
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

1415
01:55:56,928 --> 01:55:59,932
Hoch! Hoch! Hoch!
(High! High! High!)

1416
01:56:06,344 --> 01:56:08,489
On behalf of the workers, sir,

1417
01:56:08,776 --> 01:56:12,201
I wish for you a happy birthday.

1418
01:56:12,766 --> 01:56:13,825
Happy birthday

1419
01:56:14,434 --> 01:56:16,107
Well, the staff, please.

1420
01:56:16,327 --> 01:56:19,083
Thank you very much for the lovely cake.

1421
01:56:38,678 --> 01:56:42,103
Thank you very much. Tell
them thank you from me.

1422
01:56:58,353 --> 01:57:02,327
The trains arrived and the people
were driven out with clubs.

1423
01:57:03,057 --> 01:57:06,826
They were lined up in front
of two big warehouses.

1424
01:57:07,228 --> 01:57:10,907
One was marked 'Cloak Room,'
and the other 'Valuables.'

1425
01:57:11,270 --> 01:57:12,787
And there they were made to undress.

1426
01:57:13,827 --> 01:57:18,182
A Jewish boy handed them pieces of
string to tie their shoes together.

1427
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:20,482
They shaved their hair.

1428
01:57:21,293 --> 01:57:22,547
They told them it was needed to

1429
01:57:22,608 --> 01:57:24,925
make something special
for U-boat crews.

1430
01:57:26,673 --> 01:57:27,851
And then they were...

1431
01:57:28,497 --> 01:57:30,281
herded down a big corridor

1432
01:57:30,594 --> 01:57:34,384
to bunkers with Stars
of David on the doors

1433
01:57:34,723 --> 01:57:37,625
and signs that said 'Bath
and Inhalation Room.'

1434
01:57:38,837 --> 01:57:40,524
SS gave them soap.

1435
01:57:40,868 --> 01:57:42,886
They told them to breathe all the time

1436
01:57:42,947 --> 01:57:44,619
because it's good for disinfecting.

1437
01:57:47,068 --> 01:57:48,448
And then they gassed them.

1438
01:57:50,363 --> 01:57:52,502
Mila, why soaps?

1439
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:55,368
So that they would agree
to go in, I think.

1440
01:57:55,429 --> 01:57:56,562
Come on, Mila, stop it.

1441
01:57:57,009 --> 01:57:59,290
Your bedtime stories
are scaring everyone.

1442
01:57:59,372 --> 01:58:00,123
Yeah.

1443
01:58:00,605 --> 01:58:01,942
You know it's ridiculous.

1444
01:58:02,459 --> 01:58:03,635
I cannot believe it.

1445
01:58:04,129 --> 01:58:06,409
I didn't say I believed it.
I said I heard it.

1446
01:58:06,752 --> 01:58:07,590
From who?

1447
01:58:07,881 --> 01:58:10,100
From somebody who heard it
from someone who was there.

1448
01:58:10,592 --> 01:58:11,272
You know,

1449
01:58:12,079 --> 01:58:13,339
if they were there,

1450
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:15,231
they would have been gassed.

1451
01:58:15,581 --> 01:58:16,239
Yes.

1452
01:58:17,024 --> 01:58:18,446
It doesn't make any sense.

1453
01:58:18,725 --> 01:58:20,244
We're their workforce.

1454
01:58:20,975 --> 01:58:24,190
What sense does it make to
kill your own workforce?

1455
01:58:24,731 --> 01:58:29,119
To go to all this trouble of
assembling a workforce only to...

1456
01:58:29,879 --> 01:58:31,347
No, it can't be true.

1457
01:58:33,288 --> 01:58:35,804
We are very, very important for them.

1458
01:58:36,435 --> 01:58:38,777
Yeah, we do now. Good night.

1459
01:58:39,579 --> 01:58:40,258
Good night.

1460
01:58:40,832 --> 01:58:42,244
Good night. Sweet dreams.

1461
01:58:51,682 --> 01:58:53,437
Attention, attention.

1462
01:58:54,260 --> 01:58:55,946
Everyone who is alive

1463
01:58:56,971 --> 01:58:58,735
is to come to the Appellplatz.

1464
01:59:00,548 --> 01:59:01,787
Attention, attention.

1465
01:59:02,408 --> 01:59:03,690
We have to go to the Appellplatz.

1466
01:59:03,751 --> 01:59:04,843
Everyone who is alive...

1467
01:59:04,904 --> 01:59:05,996
The list makers are here.

1468
01:59:06,139 --> 01:59:07,214
...is to come to the Appellplatz.

1469
01:59:07,275 --> 01:59:08,200
There is going to be a selection.

1470
01:59:09,061 --> 01:59:10,669
Attention, attention.

1471
01:59:11,635 --> 01:59:13,428
Everyone who is alive

1472
01:59:14,168 --> 01:59:16,075
is to come to the Appellplatz.

1473
01:59:32,404 --> 01:59:33,304
Meine Herren.
(Gentlemen).

1474
01:59:33,789 --> 01:59:34,564
-Raz! (One!)
-Dwa! (Two!)

1475
01:59:34,701 --> 01:59:35,498
-Raz! (One!)
-Dwa! (Two!)

1476
01:59:37,835 --> 01:59:39,474
...die Hunderttausend Ungarn kommen...
(... hundreds of thousands of Hungarians are coming...)

1477
01:59:42,811 --> 01:59:45,485
Alle in einer Einzelreihe aufstellen!
(All line up in a single row!)

1478
01:59:46,369 --> 01:59:48,397
You could afford to
lose some weight, Amon.

1479
01:59:50,482 --> 01:59:52,461
And you've got to cut
down on the cognac.

1480
01:59:52,986 --> 01:59:53,627
Morning.

1481
01:59:54,707 --> 01:59:55,620
What's going on?

1482
01:59:56,312 --> 01:59:58,574
It's another semi-annual physical.

1483
02:00:00,883 --> 02:00:01,523
There.

1484
02:00:01,953 --> 02:00:02,861
Oh, I've...

1485
02:00:03,665 --> 02:00:05,583
got another shipment coming in of...

1486
02:00:05,846 --> 02:00:06,942
What are they this time?

1487
02:00:08,084 --> 02:00:09,740
Hungarians.
Ja, Hungarians.

1488
02:00:09,965 --> 02:00:13,560
We've got to separate the sick
from the healthy to make room.

1489
02:00:13,705 --> 02:00:15,582
Teraz! Teraz!
(Now! Now!)

1490
02:00:24,976 --> 02:00:29,458
Guten Nacht Mutter.
(Good night Mother).

1491
02:00:29,732 --> 02:00:32,406
Guten Nacht.
(Good night)

1492
02:00:35,817 --> 02:00:37,140
Das darf nicht
(This is not allowed)

1493
02:00:37,201 --> 02:00:38,563
bis zum Abend dauern!
(until the evening!)

1494
02:00:49,574 --> 02:00:50,793
Let me help you.

1495
02:00:55,493 --> 02:00:57,040
Zack, zack, zack!
(Quick, quick, quick!)

1496
02:01:03,328 --> 02:01:04,984
We've got to go out there.

1497
02:01:09,956 --> 02:01:10,795
Don't go.

1498
02:01:12,398 --> 02:01:13,610
Look alive, Rebeka.

1499
02:01:18,457 --> 02:01:20,300
Guten Nacht Mutter.
(Good night mother).

1500
02:01:21,115 --> 02:01:23,413
Na okolo! Predzej! Predzej!
(Run around! Faster! Faster!)

1501
02:01:29,255 --> 02:01:31,329
Na okolo! Na okolo!
(Run around! Run around!)

1502
02:01:33,837 --> 02:01:35,635
Guten Nacht...
(Good night)

1503
02:01:37,295 --> 02:01:38,657
That's my mechanic.

1504
02:01:39,634 --> 02:01:41,724
Whose bright idea was
it to get rid of him?

1505
02:01:50,037 --> 02:01:52,600
Ruszaj sie! Naokolo!
(Move! Run around!)

1506
02:01:53,940 --> 02:01:57,535
Szybciej! Szybciej! Trzymaj ubrania!
(Hurry! Hurry! Keep your clothes!)

1507
02:01:57,596 --> 02:01:59,872
Guten Nacht
(Good night)

1508
02:02:10,620 --> 02:02:13,029
Otworz usta. Zajrzymy do gardla.
(Open your mouth. Let me see your throat.)

1509
02:02:13,608 --> 02:02:17,009
Wez gleboki oddech. Jeszcze. Jeszcze.
(Take a deep breath. Yes. Yes.)

1510
02:02:24,634 --> 02:02:25,722
Unies ramiona.
(Lift your arms).

1511
02:02:26,903 --> 02:02:27,841
Obroc sie.
(Turn around).

1512
02:02:28,623 --> 02:02:29,517
Przykucnij.
(Squat down)

1513
02:02:36,232 --> 02:02:37,859
Formowac kolmune!
(Form a column)

1514
02:02:46,117 --> 02:02:48,781
No, no, no. Wait, go away.
She can work.

1515
02:02:48,842 --> 02:02:50,022
Come here. Look,

1516
02:02:51,334 --> 02:02:52,804
separate the sick from the healthy.

1517
02:02:52,865 --> 02:02:54,948
Those who can work and those who can't.
She can work.

1518
02:02:55,627 --> 02:02:56,990
You can work, you can come.

1519
02:02:57,921 --> 02:03:00,125
Ruszac sie! Szybciej!
(Move! Hurry!)

1520
02:04:24,799 --> 02:04:27,671
Those not selected for transport,

1521
02:04:28,844 --> 02:04:30,070
put your clothes back on.

1522
02:04:30,131 --> 02:04:31,270
Go back to the barracks.

1523
02:04:32,426 --> 02:04:34,142
Return to the barracks.

1524
02:04:41,065 --> 02:04:42,228
Go back to the barracks.

1525
02:04:46,946 --> 02:04:48,143
Oh, my God!

1526
02:05:11,387 --> 02:05:13,014
Olek? Olek?

1527
02:05:13,854 --> 02:05:14,694
Danka?

1528
02:05:14,891 --> 02:05:16,814
Olek? Olek?

1529
02:05:19,479 --> 02:05:22,908
Olek! Olek!

1530
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:32,366
Olek?

1531
02:05:32,427 --> 02:05:33,396
Danka?

1532
02:05:33,618 --> 02:05:35,461
-Danka?
-Olek?

1533
02:05:35,522 --> 02:05:37,406
Ab in die Baracke!
(Get into the barrack!)

1534
02:05:37,632 --> 02:05:38,791
In die Baracke mit euch!
(Into the barrack!)

1535
02:05:38,852 --> 02:05:40,397
I didn't see him!

1536
02:05:40,458 --> 02:05:42,506
They're hiding. I'm telling
you, they're hiding.

1537
02:05:42,906 --> 02:05:46,479
I know Danka. She knows a good place.
She took all of them together.

1538
02:05:46,559 --> 02:05:49,331
Zuruck in die Baracken!
(Back to the barracks!)

1539
02:06:08,939 --> 02:06:13,177
Find your own hiding place. There's
no room for you here. Go away, quick!

1540
02:06:37,867 --> 02:06:40,701
Get out. This is our place. Get out!

1541
02:07:04,417 --> 02:07:05,230
Oskar!

1542
02:07:05,447 --> 02:07:06,839
Amon. Gentlemen.

1543
02:07:07,909 --> 02:07:08,813
Why didn't you call me?

1544
02:07:08,874 --> 02:07:11,202
I tried to call you. Here, Hujar, move.

1545
02:07:11,409 --> 02:07:13,381
Quite a picnic, huh? Madritsch. Oskar.

1546
02:07:13,467 --> 02:07:14,781
They're running a
little late, you know?

1547
02:07:14,842 --> 02:07:16,094
It's taking longer than I thought.

1548
02:07:17,067 --> 02:07:17,887
A drink?

1549
02:07:18,514 --> 02:07:19,936
Something cold. Bowle.

1550
02:07:20,016 --> 02:07:20,826
The Bowle.

1551
02:07:24,313 --> 02:07:26,582
Oh, another beautiful day.

1552
02:07:30,382 --> 02:07:31,634
Cisza! Spokoj!
(Silence! Quiet!)

1553
02:07:40,620 --> 02:07:43,043
Die Beladung der Transportwagen ist beendet.
(Loading of the transport wagons is finished).

1554
02:07:43,164 --> 02:07:44,165
Wir sind abfahrbereit.
(We are ready for departure).

1555
02:07:45,518 --> 02:07:46,417
Wody!
(Water!)

1556
02:07:47,562 --> 02:07:49,176
Wody!
(Water!)

1557
02:07:50,670 --> 02:07:54,081
Wasser... Wasser.
(Water... Water).

1558
02:07:58,888 --> 02:07:59,679
Wohlsein.
(Well done).

1559
02:08:00,181 --> 02:08:01,353
Oh, thank you.

1560
02:08:07,379 --> 02:08:09,329
What do you say we get
your fire hoses out here

1561
02:08:09,482 --> 02:08:11,238
and hose down the cars? Thank you.

1562
02:08:15,654 --> 02:08:16,714
Indulge me.

1563
02:08:19,325 --> 02:08:20,596
-Hujar.
-Yes, sir.

1564
02:08:21,410 --> 02:08:22,852
Go bring the fire hoses.

1565
02:08:23,639 --> 02:08:24,446
Where's the fire?

1566
02:08:29,072 --> 02:08:31,713
In the windows.
That's it, that's it.

1567
02:08:31,774 --> 02:08:32,571
On the roof.

1568
02:08:33,010 --> 02:08:36,042
That's it, good, good. In
the window, in the window.

1569
02:08:39,136 --> 02:08:41,605
Come on. Come on.

1570
02:08:42,974 --> 02:08:44,149
That's it, more, more.

1571
02:08:49,864 --> 02:08:52,693
That's it, that's it.
More, more.

1572
02:08:53,276 --> 02:08:56,502
This is really cruel, Oskar.
You are giving them hope.

1573
02:08:57,002 --> 02:08:58,149
You shouldn't do that.

1574
02:08:59,662 --> 02:09:00,778
That's cruel!

1575
02:09:00,992 --> 02:09:03,915
Come on, try and reach
the far end. Look out.

1576
02:09:03,976 --> 02:09:06,180
Water! More water!

1577
02:09:10,710 --> 02:09:13,338
I've got some 200-meter hoses
back in Emalia.

1578
02:09:13,455 --> 02:09:15,399
I have 20 meters at home in my garden.

1579
02:09:15,460 --> 02:09:16,879
We can reach the cars at the end.

1580
02:09:17,555 --> 02:09:18,257
What?

1581
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:19,968
What?

1582
02:09:24,650 --> 02:09:25,234
Hujar.

1583
02:09:25,477 --> 02:09:26,793
Yeah, sure.

1584
02:09:46,328 --> 02:09:47,468
Don't forget the roof.

1585
02:09:48,205 --> 02:09:49,758
On the roof on the other side.

1586
02:09:57,923 --> 02:09:58,852
Scharfuhrer,

1587
02:09:59,549 --> 02:10:00,928
every time the train stops

1588
02:10:01,093 --> 02:10:02,777
you open the doors, you
give them water, yeah?

1589
02:10:02,838 --> 02:10:03,398
Jawohl.
(Yes).

1590
02:10:03,929 --> 02:10:05,772
This car! This car!

1591
02:10:30,590 --> 02:10:33,102
I'm not saying you'll
regret it, but you might.

1592
02:10:33,922 --> 02:10:35,212
You should be aware of that.

1593
02:10:35,711 --> 02:10:37,434
We will have to risk regret.

1594
02:10:38,714 --> 02:10:41,968
All right, sure. It's a nice day.
I'll go for a drive with you.

1595
02:11:18,671 --> 02:11:19,843
What about you?

1596
02:11:20,756 --> 02:11:22,852
I violated the Race
and Resettlement Act.

1597
02:11:24,301 --> 02:11:27,163
Though I doubt anyone can point
out the actual provision to me.

1598
02:11:28,514 --> 02:11:30,357
I kissed a Jewish girl.

1599
02:11:36,063 --> 02:11:37,322
Did your prick fall off?

1600
02:11:57,042 --> 02:11:58,544
He likes women.

1601
02:12:01,547 --> 02:12:03,978
He likes good-looking women.

1602
02:12:05,984 --> 02:12:09,158
He sees a beautiful
woman, he doesn't think.

1603
02:12:12,306 --> 02:12:13,165
I mean...

1604
02:12:13,226 --> 02:12:14,746
He has so many women.

1605
02:12:15,186 --> 02:12:16,946
And they love him.

1606
02:12:18,105 --> 02:12:21,130
Ja, they love him. I mean, he
is married, Ja, but he's...

1607
02:12:22,735 --> 02:12:23,862
All right, no.

1608
02:12:24,789 --> 02:12:26,525
She was Jewish. He
shouldn't have done it.

1609
02:12:26,586 --> 02:12:29,158
But you didn't see this girl.

1610
02:12:30,242 --> 02:12:32,847
I saw this girl. This girl was, woof...

1611
02:12:33,686 --> 02:12:35,562
She was very good-looking.

1612
02:12:40,252 --> 02:12:42,075
They cast a spell on
you, you know, the Jews.

1613
02:12:42,755 --> 02:12:44,864
When you work closely with
them, like I do, you see this.

1614
02:12:44,967 --> 02:12:46,847
They have this power.
It's like a virus.

1615
02:12:47,020 --> 02:12:48,849
Some of my men are
infected with this virus.

1616
02:12:48,928 --> 02:12:51,287
They should be pitied, not punished.
They should receive treatment.

1617
02:12:51,347 --> 02:12:54,271
This is as real as typhus.
I see this all the time.

1618
02:12:54,391 --> 02:12:55,654
It's a matter of money?

1619
02:12:56,484 --> 02:12:57,120
Hmm?

1620
02:12:58,270 --> 02:12:59,560
You're offering me a bribe?

1621
02:13:02,191 --> 02:13:03,162
A bribe? No.

1622
02:13:04,096 --> 02:13:04,714
No, please.

1623
02:13:05,900 --> 02:13:06,927
It's a gratuity.

1624
02:13:08,173 --> 02:13:08,996
Heil Hitler!

1625
02:13:13,619 --> 02:13:14,717
Hello, Amon.

1626
02:13:19,521 --> 02:13:20,152
Sit down.

1627
02:13:23,420 --> 02:13:26,325
We give you Jewish girls at
five marks a day, Oskar.

1628
02:13:27,091 --> 02:13:29,014
You should kiss us, not them.

1629
02:13:29,629 --> 02:13:32,849
God forbid you ever get a
real taste for Jewish skirt.

1630
02:13:33,472 --> 02:13:34,816
There's no future in it.

1631
02:13:34,968 --> 02:13:36,122
They don't have a future.

1632
02:13:37,726 --> 02:13:40,106
That's not just good,
old-fashioned, Jew-hating talk.

1633
02:13:41,814 --> 02:13:42,784
It's policy now.

1634
02:13:46,952 --> 02:13:48,704
Ja, schon gefangen! Gut!
(Yes, already caught! Good!)

1635
02:13:56,078 --> 02:13:59,173
Nochmal, ja! Schon!
(Again, yes! Nice!)

1636
02:14:30,195 --> 02:14:31,742
Also los! Bewegung!
(Let's go! Move!)

1637
02:14:32,015 --> 02:14:35,524
Schneller hier! Zack, zack, zack!
(Faster here! Quick, quick, quick!)

1638
02:14:35,701 --> 02:14:37,203
Beweg deinen Arsch!
(Move your ass!)

1639
02:14:39,788 --> 02:14:41,506
Das geht auch schneller!
(This is also a great success!)

1640
02:14:41,624 --> 02:14:43,126
Bewegt euch!
(Move!)

1641
02:14:43,187 --> 02:14:44,188
Schlaft nicht ein!
(Do not sleep!)

1642
02:14:45,669 --> 02:14:47,421
Nur die ganzen Fetzen, nicht das Gemuse!
(Only the whole scraps, not the vegetables!)

1643
02:14:47,504 --> 02:14:48,837
Komm, das kannst du mit den Handen machen,
(Come, you can do that with your hands,)

1644
02:14:48,898 --> 02:14:51,159
fass da vorn an!
(take the lead!)

1645
02:14:55,179 --> 02:14:57,557
Die Kleinteile lass liegen!
(Leave the small pieces!)

1646
02:15:25,250 --> 02:15:26,752
So ist es! Walhalla!
(That's the way it is! Walhalla!)

1647
02:15:27,252 --> 02:15:29,254
Walhalla ruft hier!
(Walhalla called here!)

1648
02:15:34,134 --> 02:15:35,203
Can you believe this?

1649
02:15:36,136 --> 02:15:38,492
As if I don't have enough to
do, they come up with this?

1650
02:15:39,556 --> 02:15:42,691
I have to find every rag
buried up here and burn it.

1651
02:15:45,237 --> 02:15:46,938
The party's over, Oskar.
They're closing

1652
02:15:46,999 --> 02:15:48,314
us down, sending
everybody to Auschwitz.

1653
02:15:48,375 --> 02:15:48,900
When?

1654
02:15:48,992 --> 02:15:50,989
I don't know. As soon as
I can arrange the shipments.

1655
02:15:51,050 --> 02:15:54,553
Maybe 30, 40 days.
That ought to be fun.

1656
02:16:15,723 --> 02:16:17,342
I've been talking to Goeth.

1657
02:16:17,403 --> 02:16:18,391
I know the destination.

1658
02:16:18,470 --> 02:16:20,285
These are the evacuation orders.

1659
02:16:21,350 --> 02:16:24,363
I'm to help organize the shipments,
put myself on the last train.

1660
02:16:24,430 --> 02:16:26,064
That's not what I was going to say.

1661
02:16:27,481 --> 02:16:30,067
I made Goeth promise me he'll
put in a good word for you.

1662
02:16:31,442 --> 02:16:33,133
Nothing bad is going
to happen to you there.

1663
02:16:33,194 --> 02:16:34,661
You'll receive special treatment.

1664
02:16:34,945 --> 02:16:36,747
The directives coming in from Berlin

1665
02:16:36,808 --> 02:16:38,791
mention 'special treatment'
more and more often.

1666
02:16:38,866 --> 02:16:40,739
I'd like to think
that's not what you mean.

1667
02:16:41,053 --> 02:16:42,811
Preferential treatment, all right?

1668
02:16:43,413 --> 02:16:45,053
Do we have to invent
a whole new language?

1669
02:16:45,664 --> 02:16:46,422
I think so.

1670
02:16:50,555 --> 02:16:51,772
You're staying, I take it.

1671
02:16:56,418 --> 02:16:58,341
In Krakow? What on Earth for?

1672
02:16:58,429 --> 02:16:59,992
What for? You have
a business to run.

1673
02:17:02,566 --> 02:17:04,789
Of course, you'll have to hire new workers.
Poles, I guess.

1674
02:17:04,850 --> 02:17:06,132
They cost a little more, but...

1675
02:17:10,022 --> 02:17:10,950
What are you going to do?

1676
02:17:15,694 --> 02:17:17,187
You ran my business.

1677
02:17:21,533 --> 02:17:23,100
No, I'm going home.

1678
02:17:23,619 --> 02:17:25,087
I've done what I came here for.

1679
02:17:25,141 --> 02:17:27,785
I've got more money than any
man can spend in a lifetime.

1680
02:17:39,968 --> 02:17:41,157
Some day,

1681
02:17:42,578 --> 02:17:44,784
this is all going to end, you know.

1682
02:17:49,223 --> 02:17:51,150
I was going to say
we'll have a drink then.

1683
02:17:56,013 --> 02:17:57,248
I think I better have it now.

1684
02:18:22,886 --> 02:18:26,766
Bible says And it still is news

1685
02:18:28,141 --> 02:18:33,944
Mama may have Papa may have

1686
02:18:34,898 --> 02:18:39,904
But God bless the child
That's got his own

1687
02:18:40,153 --> 02:18:42,872
That's got his own

1688
02:18:46,827 --> 02:18:51,128
Yes, the strong gets more

1689
02:18:51,290 --> 02:18:54,134
While the weak ones fade

1690
02:18:56,044 --> 02:19:01,722
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade

1691
02:19:02,509 --> 02:19:07,891
Mama may have Papa may have

1692
02:19:10,225 --> 02:19:14,480
But God bless the child
That's got his own

1693
02:19:15,314 --> 02:19:18,318
That's got his own

1694
02:19:23,697 --> 02:19:29,249
Money, you've got lots of friends

1695
02:19:32,630 --> 02:19:35,016
They're pounding on your...

1696
02:19:35,103 --> 02:19:35,859
I don't understand.

1697
02:19:37,825 --> 02:19:38,989
You want these people?

1698
02:19:39,129 --> 02:19:41,552
'These people'?
My people, I want my people.

1699
02:19:41,632 --> 02:19:42,959
Who are you, Moses?

1700
02:19:43,579 --> 02:19:44,636
Come on, what is this?

1701
02:19:44,718 --> 02:19:46,326
Where's the money in this?
Where's the scam?

1702
02:19:46,459 --> 02:19:47,815
It's good business.

1703
02:19:47,876 --> 02:19:49,602
It's good business in your opinion.

1704
02:19:49,681 --> 02:19:51,339
Look, you've got to move them,

1705
02:19:51,820 --> 02:19:52,692
the equipment,

1706
02:19:52,851 --> 02:19:54,273
everything to Czechoslovakia.

1707
02:19:54,353 --> 02:19:56,435
Pay for all that and
build another camp.

1708
02:19:56,953 --> 02:19:58,470
-Doesn't make any sense.
-Look, Amon...

1709
02:19:58,531 --> 02:20:00,114
-You're not telling me something.
-It's good for me.

1710
02:20:01,193 --> 02:20:03,176
I know them. I'm familiar with them.
I don't have to train them.

1711
02:20:03,237 --> 02:20:04,120
You're not telling me something.

1712
02:20:04,181 --> 02:20:05,803
It's good for you.
I'll compensate you.

1713
02:20:05,864 --> 02:20:07,471
That's right.
It's good for the army.

1714
02:20:07,785 --> 02:20:08,706
Yeah, of course.

1715
02:20:08,767 --> 02:20:10,130
-You know what I'm going to make?
-What?

1716
02:20:11,536 --> 02:20:13,479
-Artillery shells.
-Everyone's making artillery shells.

1717
02:20:13,540 --> 02:20:15,188
-Tank shells, they need that.
-Tanks shells, ja.

1718
02:20:15,248 --> 02:20:17,662
-Everybody's happy.
-Everyone's happy, except me.

1719
02:20:18,201 --> 02:20:20,198
You're probably scamming me somehow.

1720
02:20:21,536 --> 02:20:23,938
If I'm making 100,
you've got to be making 300.

1721
02:20:24,549 --> 02:20:26,916
And if you admit to 300,
then it's 400, actually.

1722
02:20:27,502 --> 02:20:28,088
But how?

1723
02:20:28,149 --> 02:20:28,985
I just told you.

1724
02:20:29,046 --> 02:20:30,392
You did, but you didn't.

1725
02:20:33,892 --> 02:20:35,237
Ja, all right, don't tell me.

1726
02:20:36,144 --> 02:20:37,153
I'll go along with it.

1727
02:20:38,986 --> 02:20:40,463
It's just irritating
I can't work it out.

1728
02:20:40,524 --> 02:20:41,083
Look,

1729
02:20:41,963 --> 02:20:44,224
all you have to do is tell
me what it's worth to you.

1730
02:20:45,487 --> 02:20:47,798
-What's a person worth to you?
-No, no, no, no.

1731
02:20:48,073 --> 02:20:50,015
What's one worth to you?

1732
02:20:58,875 --> 02:21:02,425
Poldek Pfefferberg.
Mila Pfefferberg.

1733
02:21:03,255 --> 02:21:03,802
And...

1734
02:21:06,562 --> 02:21:08,643
Uh... Stagel, Stagel...

1735
02:21:08,705 --> 02:21:10,314
Paul.
Paul Stagel.

1736
02:21:10,593 --> 02:21:11,499
Doctor.

1737
02:21:14,016 --> 02:21:15,096
The investors.

1738
02:21:16,489 --> 02:21:17,831
-I want all of them.
-Yes, sir.

1739
02:21:18,812 --> 02:21:20,439
Fischer. Ismail Fischer.

1740
02:21:20,564 --> 02:21:23,453
Fischer, Ismail.

1741
02:21:24,109 --> 02:21:25,782
Josef Scharf.

1742
02:21:25,843 --> 02:21:27,635
One moment, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.

1743
02:21:27,696 --> 02:21:29,428
Come on, Stern.
Scharf, Scharf.

1744
02:21:32,677 --> 02:21:35,075
The children.
All the children.

1745
02:21:40,379 --> 02:21:42,381
-Herbert Stier.
-Thank you.

1746
02:21:43,048 --> 02:21:43,754
How many?

1747
02:21:44,497 --> 02:21:46,451
Four hundred, 450.

1748
02:21:49,468 --> 02:21:50,382
More, more.

1749
02:22:15,660 --> 02:22:18,215
-Feigenbaum, Jakob.
-Wolf. Wolf Wein.

1750
02:22:25,002 --> 02:22:28,106
Feigenbaum, Lutek, Jakob... Nacha.

1751
02:22:28,987 --> 02:22:29,693
Yes? Nacha.

1752
02:22:30,160 --> 02:22:31,260
Nacha, that's right.

1753
02:22:31,709 --> 02:22:32,557
And Wolf.

1754
02:22:33,917 --> 02:22:34,584
How many?

1755
02:22:37,911 --> 02:22:38,491
600.

1756
02:22:40,023 --> 02:22:40,586
More.

1757
02:22:42,813 --> 02:22:44,098
You can do the same thing I'm doing.

1758
02:22:44,159 --> 02:22:45,226
You might even make money at it.

1759
02:22:46,093 --> 02:22:46,768
I don't know.

1760
02:22:46,829 --> 02:22:49,895
Come on, Julius, I know about the
extra food and clothes you give them.

1761
02:22:49,956 --> 02:22:51,339
Paid for out of your own pocket.

1762
02:22:51,734 --> 02:22:52,958
If we make a combined approach,

1763
02:22:53,019 --> 02:22:54,991
we could get more than
4,000 out, mine and yours.

1764
02:22:55,052 --> 02:22:55,514
Oskar...

1765
02:22:55,575 --> 02:22:57,914
We could relocate them in something
like safety, in Moravia.

1766
02:23:00,340 --> 02:23:01,013
I don't know.

1767
02:23:04,120 --> 02:23:05,856
How many cigarettes
have you smoked tonight?

1768
02:23:06,503 --> 02:23:07,114
Too many.

1769
02:23:07,629 --> 02:23:08,425
For every one...

1770
02:23:09,654 --> 02:23:10,863
you smoke, I smoke half.

1771
02:23:12,968 --> 02:23:14,811
I've done all I can.
I will not accept that.

1772
02:23:14,886 --> 02:23:16,491
No, Oskar, I can't do any more.

1773
02:23:16,552 --> 02:23:17,786
I will not accept that.

1774
02:23:18,390 --> 02:23:19,130
No.

1775
02:23:29,901 --> 02:23:31,019
How many? How many?

1776
02:23:31,188 --> 02:23:34,347
-850, give or take.
-Give or take what, Stern?

1777
02:23:34,496 --> 02:23:36,381
Give or take what? Count them.
How many?

1778
02:23:47,410 --> 02:23:48,070
That's it.

1779
02:23:48,590 --> 02:23:49,744
You can finish that page.

1780
02:23:55,635 --> 02:23:59,298
What did Goeth say about this?

1781
02:23:59,359 --> 02:24:02,704
You just told him how many
people you needed and...

1782
02:24:06,552 --> 02:24:07,612
You're not buying them.

1783
02:24:11,401 --> 02:24:12,794
You're buying them?

1784
02:24:13,335 --> 02:24:14,496
You're paying him for
each of these names?

1785
02:24:14,604 --> 02:24:15,770
If you were still working for me,

1786
02:24:15,831 --> 02:24:17,271
I'd expect you to talk me out of it.

1787
02:24:17,616 --> 02:24:18,968
It's costing me a fortune.

1788
02:24:21,601 --> 02:24:23,936
Finish the page and leave
one space at the bottom.

1789
02:24:47,521 --> 02:24:48,040
You...

1790
02:24:55,515 --> 02:24:57,393
The list is an absolute good.

1791
02:24:59,769 --> 02:25:02,192
The list is life.

1792
02:25:04,172 --> 02:25:07,638
All around its margins lies the gulf.

1793
02:25:09,574 --> 02:25:11,858
Oskar, there's a clerical error here

1794
02:25:12,038 --> 02:25:13,545
at the bottom of the last page.

1795
02:25:13,672 --> 02:25:15,788
No, there's one more name
I want to put there.

1796
02:25:16,266 --> 02:25:18,848
I'll never find a maid as well
trained as her at Brinnlitz.

1797
02:25:19,113 --> 02:25:20,376
They are all country girls.

1798
02:25:22,335 --> 02:25:22,976
No.

1799
02:25:32,896 --> 02:25:33,372
No.

1800
02:25:34,773 --> 02:25:35,990
One hand of 21.

1801
02:25:36,503 --> 02:25:36,907
No.

1802
02:25:36,987 --> 02:25:39,829
-If you win, I pay you 7,400 reichsmarks.
-No.

1803
02:25:39,890 --> 02:25:43,013
-Hit a natural, I make it 14,800.
-No.

1804
02:25:43,785 --> 02:25:45,686
If I win, the girl goes on my list.

1805
02:25:47,289 --> 02:25:49,150
I can't wager Helen in a card game.

1806
02:25:49,211 --> 02:25:49,890
Why not?

1807
02:25:50,357 --> 02:25:51,258
Wouldn't be right.

1808
02:25:51,459 --> 02:25:53,201
She's just going to Auschwitz
Number Two, anyway.

1809
02:25:53,262 --> 02:25:55,162
-What difference does it make?
-She's not going to Auschwitz.

1810
02:25:55,255 --> 02:25:56,355
I'd never do that to her.

1811
02:25:57,820 --> 02:25:59,972
No, I want her to come
back to Vienna with me.

1812
02:26:00,051 --> 02:26:01,101
I want her to come...

1813
02:26:01,934 --> 02:26:04,564
to work for me there.
I want to grow old with her.

1814
02:26:05,234 --> 02:26:06,183
Are you mad?

1815
02:26:07,999 --> 02:26:08,634
Amon,

1816
02:26:09,548 --> 02:26:11,053
you can't take her to Vienna with you.

1817
02:26:11,482 --> 02:26:12,873
No, of course I can't.

1818
02:26:14,538 --> 02:26:15,664
That's what I'd like to do.

1819
02:26:17,127 --> 02:26:20,136
What I can do,
if I'm any sort of a man,

1820
02:26:21,216 --> 02:26:23,045
is the next most merciful thing.

1821
02:26:23,305 --> 02:26:24,591
I shall take her into the woods and

1822
02:26:24,858 --> 02:26:26,818
shoot her painlessly
in the back of the head.

1823
02:26:37,399 --> 02:26:38,921
What was it you said for a...

1824
02:26:39,803 --> 02:26:41,054
natural 21?

1825
02:26:42,020 --> 02:26:43,493
Was it 14,800?

1826
02:26:44,561 --> 02:26:47,730
Schindlerjuden to these tables!
Say your names clearly.

1827
02:26:47,791 --> 02:26:49,753
We are the family Dresner.

1828
02:26:50,027 --> 02:26:52,643
Juda, Jonas, Donata, and Chaja.

1829
02:26:54,189 --> 02:26:57,599
We are Rosners. Henry, Manci and Leo.

1830
02:26:57,942 --> 02:26:59,423
-And our son.
-I am Olek.

1831
02:27:01,029 --> 02:27:02,097
Maria Mischel.

1832
02:27:02,681 --> 02:27:03,554
Chaim Nowak.

1833
02:27:05,658 --> 02:27:07,054
Wulkan, Markus.

1834
02:27:08,036 --> 02:27:09,252
Michael Lemper.

1835
02:27:11,184 --> 02:27:12,328
Itzhak Stern.

1836
02:27:13,666 --> 02:27:15,131
Rebeka and Joseph Bau.

1837
02:27:17,170 --> 02:27:19,093
-Rosalia Nussbaum.
-Wilhelm Nussbaum.

1838
02:27:20,173 --> 02:27:21,640
Jakob Levartov.

1839
02:27:23,093 --> 02:27:25,047
-Farber, Rosa.
-Farber, Andrzej.

1840
02:27:25,929 --> 02:27:26,551
Sara.

1841
02:27:27,077 --> 02:27:28,040
Friehof, Fischel.

1842
02:27:29,902 --> 02:27:30,822
Mietek Pemper.

1843
02:27:31,935 --> 02:27:33,467
Poldek and Mila Pfefferberg.

1844
02:27:34,646 --> 02:27:35,963
Horowitz, Dolek.

1845
02:27:38,229 --> 02:27:39,041
Adam Levy.

1846
02:27:40,426 --> 02:27:41,383
Marcel Goldberg.

1847
02:27:42,695 --> 02:27:44,337
Klipstein, Isak David.

1848
02:27:46,282 --> 02:27:47,297
Altmann, Eduard.

1849
02:27:48,365 --> 02:27:49,418
Grunberg, Miriam.

1850
02:27:50,328 --> 02:27:51,470
Luftig, Eliasz.

1851
02:27:52,875 --> 02:27:53,776
Hilmann, Eduard.

1852
02:27:54,624 --> 02:27:55,434
Erna Rothberg.

1853
02:27:57,293 --> 02:27:58,479
Zuckermann, Jetti.

1854
02:28:00,433 --> 02:28:01,427
Helen Hirsch.

1855
02:28:04,175 --> 02:28:05,635
The worst is over.

1856
02:28:07,595 --> 02:28:10,369
Men to this transport
and women to this transport.

1857
02:28:11,891 --> 02:28:12,839
Be careful.

1858
02:28:13,421 --> 02:28:16,360
Men to this transport and
women to this transport.

1859
02:28:16,855 --> 02:28:20,680
Watch your step. Men to this transport
and women to this transport.

1860
02:28:59,314 --> 02:29:01,053
Wonderful, Olek,

1861
02:29:02,560 --> 02:29:03,299
wonderful.

1862
02:29:03,655 --> 02:29:07,336
You know how we make ice into water?

1863
02:29:09,687 --> 02:29:11,018
Olek, get another one!

1864
02:29:49,737 --> 02:29:51,857
Alle in einer Einzelreihe aufstellen!
(All stand in a single row!)

1865
02:29:53,535 --> 02:29:54,747
You'll be pleased with the level

1866
02:29:54,808 --> 02:29:56,560
of efficiency I get from these workers.

1867
02:29:59,707 --> 02:30:01,659
Budzyn, under my command,

1868
02:30:02,089 --> 02:30:04,576
was the envy of every other
commandant in the labour camp system.

1869
02:30:05,129 --> 02:30:06,446
-The prisoners, however...
-Excuse me.

1870
02:30:06,532 --> 02:30:08,250
they would have rather
been somewhere else.

1871
02:30:23,872 --> 02:30:26,999
The train with the
women has already left Plaszow

1872
02:30:27,289 --> 02:30:29,497
and will be arriving here very shortly.

1873
02:30:30,882 --> 02:30:32,833
I know you've had a long journey.

1874
02:30:33,741 --> 02:30:36,585
But it's only a short walk
further to the factory,

1875
02:30:36,907 --> 02:30:40,765
where hot soup and
bread is waiting for you.

1876
02:30:42,658 --> 02:30:43,846
Welcome to Brinnlitz!

1877
02:30:54,345 --> 02:30:55,767
Beans in cholent?

1878
02:30:55,888 --> 02:30:57,551
Beans are the best part.

1879
02:30:57,656 --> 02:30:59,078
I don't like beans.

1880
02:31:00,018 --> 02:31:03,553
Beans and meat and potatoes and bread.

1881
02:31:03,956 --> 02:31:06,232
That's not the way you make cholent.

1882
02:31:10,581 --> 02:31:11,707
Eggs in cholent?

1883
02:31:12,258 --> 02:31:13,143
Yes!

1884
02:31:16,159 --> 02:31:17,285
I don't like cholent.

1885
02:31:17,410 --> 02:31:18,536
No, you don't.

1886
02:31:19,006 --> 02:31:20,098
What do you like?

1887
02:31:20,363 --> 02:31:21,372
I like caviar.

1888
02:31:24,182 --> 02:31:25,809
One day on the fire...

1889
02:32:32,690 --> 02:32:34,870
Alle vorm Wagen in Position bleiben.
(All cars are in position.)

1890
02:32:36,406 --> 02:32:38,371
Alle in der Gruppe zusammenbleiben.
(All stay together in the group.)

1891
02:32:39,320 --> 02:32:40,947
Wegbleiben vom Wagen!
(Stay away from the car!)

1892
02:32:42,645 --> 02:32:43,887
Wegbleiben vom Wagen!
(Stay away from the car!)

1893
02:32:45,259 --> 02:32:47,084
Wegbleiben vom Wagen, hab ich gesagt!
(Stay away from the car, I said!)

1894
02:32:51,132 --> 02:32:54,637
Schneller! Dalli, dalli, dalli!
(Faster! Quick, quick, quick!)

1895
02:32:55,800 --> 02:32:57,084
Was ist da hinten los!
(What's going on here!)

1896
02:33:01,004 --> 02:33:01,584
Schnell!
(Quick!)

1897
02:33:07,290 --> 02:33:09,510
Los, raus mit euch. Zack, zack, zack! Raus!
(Get out! Quick, Quick, quick! Out!)

1898
02:33:10,925 --> 02:33:17,664
Dreizig, funfunddreizig, vierzig, funfundvierzig.
(Thirty, thirty-five, forty, forty-five).

1899
02:33:18,912 --> 02:33:19,859
Aussteigen!
(Get out!)

1900
02:33:32,253 --> 02:33:33,818
Where are the list makers?

1901
02:33:33,924 --> 02:33:34,968
Where are the tables?

1902
02:33:40,845 --> 02:33:42,224
Raus mit euch!
(Get out!)

1903
02:33:43,681 --> 02:33:44,477
Hopp, hopp!

1904
02:33:44,538 --> 02:33:45,840
...bagaze w wagonach!
(...luggage in wagons!)

1905
02:33:47,769 --> 02:33:50,522
Dalli! Rausgehen! Schneller!
(Quick! Get out! Faster!)

1906
02:33:50,980 --> 02:33:53,403
Zostawcie bagaze w wagonach!
(Leave the luggage in the wagons!)

1907
02:33:54,108 --> 02:33:54,924
Schneller!
(Faster!)

1908
02:33:55,559 --> 02:33:57,921
Danka! Danka! Danka!
(Go faster!)

1909
02:33:58,254 --> 02:33:59,619
Mama, where are we?

1910
02:34:04,087 --> 02:34:05,332
They're in Auschwitz.

1911
02:34:05,555 --> 02:34:08,050
The train was never routed here.
A paperwork mistake.

1912
02:34:16,258 --> 02:34:17,654
Szybciej! Szybko!
(Hurry! Fast!)

1913
02:34:17,715 --> 02:34:19,592
Die Schuhe werfen!
(Remove your shoes!)

1914
02:34:33,234 --> 02:34:34,193
Schneller! Schneller!
(Faster! Faster!)

1915
02:34:34,254 --> 02:34:35,347

(Fold your clothing!)

1916
02:34:38,528 --> 02:34:39,426

(To the shower!)

1917
02:34:39,487 --> 02:34:41,077
-Zieht euch aus! Bewegung!
(Remove your clothes! Move!)

1918
02:34:41,155 --> 02:34:41,835
Bewegt euch!
(Move!)

1919
02:34:41,896 --> 02:34:43,874
Stellt euch auf und zieht euch aus!
(Stand up and go out!)

1920
02:34:43,950 --> 02:34:45,270
-Rozbierac sie tam szybciej!
(Undress faster!)

1921
02:34:45,331 --> 02:34:46,126
Schneller!
(Faster!)

1922
02:34:48,621 --> 02:34:49,975
Szybko sie rozbierac.
(Undress quickly).

1923
02:34:51,582 --> 02:34:52,955
Dostaniecie mydlo I recznik...
(Get a soap and towel...)

1924
02:34:53,016 --> 02:34:55,578
I pojdziecie pod prysznic do dezynfeckji!
(and go to the shower for disinfection!)

1925
02:34:55,967 --> 02:34:57,310
Szybko sie rozbierac!
(Undress quickly).

1926
02:35:02,061 --> 02:35:02,759
Schneller!
(Faster!)

1927
02:35:02,820 --> 02:35:04,854
Zabierajcie to mydlo I szybko!
(Take that soap quickly!)

1928
02:35:05,022 --> 02:35:07,662
Zieht euch schneller aus! Bewegung!
(Move out faster! Move!)

1929
02:35:14,625 --> 02:35:15,596
Szybko! Szybko!
(Quickly! Quickly!)

1930
02:35:15,657 --> 02:35:16,721
Sofort hinein! Schneller!
(Get in immediately! Faster!)

1931
02:35:17,817 --> 02:35:19,865
Pojdziecie pod prysznic! Szybko!
(Into the shower! Quick!)

1932
02:35:19,944 --> 02:35:21,058

1933
02:35:21,946 --> 02:35:23,695

(Into the bath! Faster!)

1934
02:35:26,784 --> 02:35:29,788
Schneller! Schneller!
(Faster! Faster)

1935
02:35:31,475 --> 02:35:33,227
Szybko! Szybko!
(Quickly! Quickly!)

1936
02:35:34,083 --> 02:35:34,925
Tu wchodzic!
(Come in!)

1937
02:38:01,105 --> 02:38:02,322
Blick hinunter!
(Look down!)

1938
02:38:05,776 --> 02:38:07,294
Die Hand auf die Schulter!
(Hand on the shoulder!)

1939
02:38:08,495 --> 02:38:09,747
How old are you, mother?

1940
02:38:10,033 --> 02:38:11,330
Sixty-eight.

1941
02:38:11,831 --> 02:38:12,573
Cough for me, mother.

1942
02:38:12,634 --> 02:38:16,560
They say to fall against
the fence is a kindness.

1943
02:38:17,004 --> 02:38:19,849
Don't kill yourself
against the fence, Clara.

1944
02:38:20,166 --> 02:38:22,636
If you do, you'll never know
what happened to you.

1945
02:38:26,005 --> 02:38:27,104
How old are you, mother?

1946
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:28,590
Sixty-six, sir.

1947
02:38:28,716 --> 02:38:29,257
Sir?

1948
02:38:29,937 --> 02:38:30,670
Good morning.

1949
02:38:30,843 --> 02:38:33,659
A mistake has been made. We
are not supposed to be here.

1950
02:38:33,929 --> 02:38:35,577
We work for Oskar Schindler.

1951
02:38:36,124 --> 02:38:37,414
We are Schindler Jews.

1952
02:38:37,808 --> 02:38:39,082
Who is Oskar Schindler?

1953
02:38:39,508 --> 02:38:41,036
He had a factory in Krakow.

1954
02:38:41,292 --> 02:38:42,010
Enamelware.

1955
02:38:43,475 --> 02:38:44,864
A pot maker.

1956
02:38:46,223 --> 02:38:47,429
How old are you, mother?

1957
02:38:52,638 --> 02:38:55,841
You are not the only
industrialist who needs labour,

1958
02:38:58,329 --> 02:38:59,244
Herr Schindler.

1959
02:39:00,998 --> 02:39:03,883
I remember earlier this
year, IG Farben ordered

1960
02:39:03,944 --> 02:39:05,698
a trainload of Hungarians

1961
02:39:06,611 --> 02:39:08,198
for its chemical factory.

1962
02:39:09,925 --> 02:39:12,644
The train came in through the archway

1963
02:39:13,858 --> 02:39:17,884
and the officer in charge of the
selection went immediately to work

1964
02:39:19,550 --> 02:39:21,393
and sent 2,000 of them

1965
02:39:22,144 --> 02:39:23,987
straight away to Special Treatment.

1966
02:39:26,524 --> 02:39:28,637
It is not my task to interfere with

1967
02:39:28,698 --> 02:39:30,496
the processes that
take place down here.

1968
02:39:33,197 --> 02:39:34,909
Why do you think I can help you

1969
02:39:35,607 --> 02:39:37,457
if I can't help IG Farben?

1970
02:39:38,482 --> 02:39:40,106
Allow me to express the reason.

1971
02:39:50,297 --> 02:39:52,371
I'm not making any judgement about you.

1972
02:39:53,592 --> 02:39:56,345
It's just that I know that
in the coming months,

1973
02:39:56,406 --> 02:39:58,475
we're all going to
need portable wealth.

1974
02:40:02,768 --> 02:40:04,664
I could have you arrested.

1975
02:40:05,521 --> 02:40:07,440
I'm protected by powerful friends.

1976
02:40:08,301 --> 02:40:09,134
You should know that.

1977
02:40:13,320 --> 02:40:15,647
I do not say I am accepting them.

1978
02:40:17,366 --> 02:40:20,346
All I say is, I'm not comfortable
with them on the table.

1979
02:40:36,135 --> 02:40:38,217
I have a shipment coming in tomorrow.

1980
02:40:39,550 --> 02:40:41,473
I'll cut you 300 units from it.

1981
02:40:41,765 --> 02:40:42,551
New ones.

1982
02:40:43,971 --> 02:40:44,999
These are fresh.

1983
02:40:49,773 --> 02:40:52,117
The train comes, we turn it around.

1984
02:40:52,178 --> 02:40:53,453
Mmm, yes, yes.

1985
02:40:53,514 --> 02:40:54,883
-It's yours.
-I understand.

1986
02:40:55,560 --> 02:40:56,310
I want these.

1987
02:41:00,801 --> 02:41:02,751
You shouldn't get stuck on names.

1988
02:41:11,212 --> 02:41:12,142
That's right.

1989
02:41:13,039 --> 02:41:14,564
It creates a lot of paperwork.

1990
02:41:15,591 --> 02:41:17,601
Zoldinger, Ernestina!

1991
02:41:17,797 --> 02:41:19,576
Waldergrun, Hilda!

1992
02:41:19,720 --> 02:41:21,645
Waldergrun, Leonora!

1993
02:41:21,847 --> 02:41:23,415
Laast, Anna!

1994
02:41:23,561 --> 02:41:25,314
Pfefferberg, Mila!

1995
02:41:25,476 --> 02:41:26,818
Dresner, Horsch!

1996
02:41:27,258 --> 02:41:29,040
Dresner, Danka!

1997
02:41:29,104 --> 02:41:30,893
Nussbaum, Sidonia!

1998
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:32,589
Rosner, Manci!

1999
02:41:32,816 --> 02:41:34,400
Hirsch, Helen!

2000
02:41:34,461 --> 02:41:36,279
Grosz, Chaja Sara!

2001
02:41:36,499 --> 02:41:38,357
Seelenfreund, Estella!

2002
02:41:53,587 --> 02:41:54,595
Schneller laufen!
(Run faster!)

2003
02:41:54,719 --> 02:41:57,026
Schneller laufen! Schneller!
(Run faster! Faster!)

2004
02:41:57,087 --> 02:41:59,732
Schneller! Schneller! Mach schon! Voran!
(Faster! Faster! Come on! Forward!)

2005
02:42:01,095 --> 02:42:03,601
Los, los, los! Schneller!
(Go, go, go! Faster!)

2006
02:42:07,184 --> 02:42:08,396
Schneller! Bewegt euch!
(Faster! Move!)

2007
02:42:11,647 --> 02:42:13,277
Bojcie sie! Bojcie sie!
(Scare them! Scare them!)

2008
02:42:19,154 --> 02:42:22,195
No! No! No!

2009
02:42:24,808 --> 02:42:28,654
Madchen, los jetzt aber! Jetzt aber Tempo!
(Girl, let's go now! Now, quickly!)

2010
02:42:40,384 --> 02:42:43,979
Danka! Danka! Danka!

2011
02:42:44,054 --> 02:42:46,477
No! No! No!

2012
02:42:48,654 --> 02:42:52,404
Hey! Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

2013
02:42:52,813 --> 02:42:56,568
These are mine! These are my workers!
They should be on my train!

2014
02:42:57,568 --> 02:42:59,866
They're skilled munitions workers!
They're essential!

2015
02:43:00,738 --> 02:43:01,971
Essential girls!

2016
02:43:05,659 --> 02:43:09,459
Their fingers polish the insides
of shell metal casings.

2017
02:43:10,181 --> 02:43:11,854
How else am I to polish the inside

2018
02:43:11,915 --> 02:43:13,547
of a 45 millimetre shell casing?

2019
02:43:13,751 --> 02:43:15,776
You tell me. You tell me!

2020
02:43:18,839 --> 02:43:20,034
Back on the train!

2021
02:43:21,481 --> 02:43:22,496
Back on the train!

2022
02:45:17,458 --> 02:45:20,428
Under Department 'W' provisions

2023
02:45:21,587 --> 02:45:24,511
it is unlawful to kill a
worker without just cause.

2024
02:45:26,091 --> 02:45:28,594
Under the Businesses Compensation Fund

2025
02:45:29,219 --> 02:45:32,063
I am entitled to file damage
claims for such deaths.

2026
02:45:33,594 --> 02:45:35,847
If you shoot without thinking,

2027
02:45:36,685 --> 02:45:37,744
you go to prison,

2028
02:45:39,058 --> 02:45:39,965
I get paid.

2029
02:45:41,064 --> 02:45:41,958
That's how it works.

2030
02:45:43,358 --> 02:45:43,919
So,

2031
02:45:44,812 --> 02:45:47,139
there will be no summary
executions here.

2032
02:45:49,406 --> 02:45:52,580
There will be no interference
of any kind with production.

2033
02:45:54,244 --> 02:45:55,470
In hopes of ensuring that,

2034
02:45:56,070 --> 02:45:58,916
guards will no longer be
allowed on the factory floor

2035
02:45:59,416 --> 02:46:01,178
without my authorization.

2036
02:46:07,947 --> 02:46:10,481
For your cooperation,
you have my gratitude.

2037
02:46:13,110 --> 02:46:14,290
Come on, come.

2038
02:46:15,851 --> 02:46:17,818
Mensch, seit Jahren hab ich so etwas nicht mehr gesehen.
(Men, I have not had such a thing for years).

2039
02:46:17,935 --> 02:46:19,337
Come on, boys, come.

2040
02:46:19,398 --> 02:46:21,259
Guck dir mal die Buddeln an!
(Look at the men!)

2041
02:46:46,880 --> 02:46:47,861
No doorman

2042
02:46:48,755 --> 02:46:51,320
or maitre d' will ever
mistake you again.

2043
02:46:52,765 --> 02:46:53,554
I promise.

2044
02:46:59,042 --> 02:46:59,611
Itzhak.

2045
02:47:01,992 --> 02:47:03,805
This is Itzhak Stern, my accountant.
Itzhak...

2046
02:47:03,866 --> 02:47:05,549
You must be Mrs. Schindler.

2047
02:47:05,649 --> 02:47:06,506
It's a pleasure to meet you.

2048
02:47:06,620 --> 02:47:08,257
Emilie has volunteered
to work in the clinic.

2049
02:47:08,318 --> 02:47:10,208
-Very generous of you.
-I know.

2050
02:47:10,269 --> 02:47:11,822
We need to talk when you have a moment.

2051
02:47:13,157 --> 02:47:15,539
This is my wife, Stern. I don't
keep any secrets from my spouse.

2052
02:47:15,600 --> 02:47:18,271
Oskar, please, attend to business.
It's much more attractive.

2053
02:47:18,833 --> 02:47:19,859
Madam.
Hello.

2054
02:47:19,920 --> 02:47:21,769
-What is it?
-We've received an angry complaint

2055
02:47:21,830 --> 02:47:22,962
from the Armaments Board.

2056
02:47:23,584 --> 02:47:25,712
The artillery shells,
tank shells, rocket casings,

2057
02:47:25,794 --> 02:47:28,402
apparently all of them have
failed quality control tests.

2058
02:47:28,463 --> 02:47:30,390
That's to be expected.
Start-up problems.

2059
02:47:30,591 --> 02:47:32,823
This isn't pots and pans.
This is a precise business.

2060
02:47:32,884 --> 02:47:34,743
I'll write them a letter.
They're withholding payment.

2061
02:47:34,803 --> 02:47:36,646
Sure, so would I, so would you.

2062
02:47:36,722 --> 02:47:39,081
I wouldn't worry about it. We'll
get it right one of these days.

2063
02:47:39,141 --> 02:47:42,172
There's a rumour you've been going
around miscalibrating the machines.

2064
02:47:43,896 --> 02:47:46,305
They could shut us down,
send us back to Auschwitz.

2065
02:47:49,526 --> 02:47:51,699
I'll call around, find out
where we can buy shells.

2066
02:47:51,842 --> 02:47:52,708
Pass them off as ours.

2067
02:47:52,769 --> 02:47:53,836
I don't see the difference.

2068
02:47:53,897 --> 02:47:55,205
Whether they're made here
or somewhere else...

2069
02:47:55,266 --> 02:47:56,807
You don't see a difference?
I see a difference.

2070
02:47:56,867 --> 02:47:57,749
You'll lose a lot of money.

2071
02:47:57,810 --> 02:47:59,117
Fewer shells will be made.

2072
02:47:59,846 --> 02:48:01,644
Stern, if this factory ever produces

2073
02:48:01,705 --> 02:48:03,312
a shell that can actually be fired,

2074
02:48:03,717 --> 02:48:04,974
I'll be very unhappy-

2075
02:48:06,960 --> 02:48:08,939
Hello, madam.
How do you do?

2076
02:48:23,644 --> 02:48:24,599
How are you doing, Rabbi?

2077
02:48:25,884 --> 02:48:26,603
Rabbi!

2078
02:48:30,192 --> 02:48:31,418
Good, Herr Direktor.

2079
02:48:34,009 --> 02:48:35,012
Sun's going down.

2080
02:48:38,575 --> 02:48:39,747
Yes, it is.

2081
02:48:41,965 --> 02:48:42,734
What day is this?

2082
02:48:43,357 --> 02:48:43,941
Friday?

2083
02:48:44,536 --> 02:48:45,587
It is Friday, isn't it?

2084
02:48:45,905 --> 02:48:46,495
Is it?

2085
02:48:51,505 --> 02:48:52,672
What's the matter with you?

2086
02:48:53,225 --> 02:48:55,060
You should be preparing
for the Sabbath.

2087
02:48:56,458 --> 02:48:57,243
Shouldn't you?

2088
02:49:05,477 --> 02:49:06,577
I've got some wine.

2089
02:49:07,877 --> 02:49:09,337
In my office. Come.

2090
02:50:25,156 --> 02:50:25,755
What?

2091
02:50:28,281 --> 02:50:29,353
Do you have any money...

2092
02:50:31,913 --> 02:50:34,499
hidden away some place
that I don't know about?

2093
02:50:39,398 --> 02:50:39,892
No.

2094
02:50:46,328 --> 02:50:47,910
Why? Am I broke?

2095
02:50:50,414 --> 02:50:51,182
Uh...

2096
02:50:53,277 --> 02:50:54,156
Well...

2097
02:50:56,546 --> 02:50:58,104
Yesterday morning,

2098
02:50:58,855 --> 02:51:01,818
at 2:41 a.m.,

2099
02:51:02,886 --> 02:51:05,810
at General Eisenhower's headquarters,

2100
02:51:06,890 --> 02:51:08,477
General Jodl

2101
02:51:09,583 --> 02:51:13,250
signed the Act of
Unconditional Surrender

2102
02:51:13,864 --> 02:51:19,257
of all German land,
sea and air forces in Europe

2103
02:51:20,074 --> 02:51:22,623
to the Allied Expeditionary Force

2104
02:51:23,907 --> 02:51:28,003
and simultaneously
to the Soviet High Command.

2105
02:51:28,833 --> 02:51:31,427
The German war is,
therefore, at an end.

2106
02:51:32,707 --> 02:51:34,675
But let us not forget for a moment...

2107
02:51:34,751 --> 02:51:37,770
I think it's time the guards
came into the factory.

2108
02:51:39,228 --> 02:51:41,155
Japan, with all her treachery...

2109
02:51:42,425 --> 02:51:44,836
The unconditional
surrender of Germany...

2110
02:51:45,279 --> 02:51:46,331
has just been announced.

2111
02:51:48,098 --> 02:51:49,441
At midnight tonight,

2112
02:51:50,026 --> 02:51:51,977
the war is over.

2113
02:51:54,771 --> 02:51:55,459
Tomorrow...

2114
02:51:56,102 --> 02:51:59,420
you'll begin the process of looking
for survivors of your families.

2115
02:52:03,206 --> 02:52:04,422
In most cases,

2116
02:52:06,783 --> 02:52:07,896
you won't find them.

2117
02:52:09,953 --> 02:52:11,930
After six long years of murder,

2118
02:52:12,873 --> 02:52:15,216
victims are being mourned
throughout the world.

2119
02:52:18,295 --> 02:52:19,211
We've survived.

2120
02:52:21,590 --> 02:52:23,803
Many of you have come up to me
and thanked me.

2121
02:52:27,888 --> 02:52:29,073
Thank yourselves.

2122
02:52:31,354 --> 02:52:32,873
Thank your fearless Stern

2123
02:52:34,519 --> 02:52:36,652
and others among you
who worried about you

2124
02:52:36,713 --> 02:52:38,265
and faced death at every moment.

2125
02:52:43,774 --> 02:52:45,533
I'm a member of the Nazi Party.

2126
02:52:46,698 --> 02:52:48,492
I'm a munitions manufacturer.

2127
02:52:49,743 --> 02:52:51,460
I'm a profiteer of slave labour.

2128
02:52:52,495 --> 02:52:53,203
I am...

2129
02:52:53,904 --> 02:52:54,587
a criminal.

2130
02:52:56,374 --> 02:52:58,813
At midnight you'll be free,
and I'll be hunted.

2131
02:53:01,968 --> 02:53:04,713
I shall remain with you until
five minutes after midnight,

2132
02:53:05,508 --> 02:53:08,159
after which time,
and I hope you'll forgive me,

2133
02:53:08,815 --> 02:53:09,805
I have to flee.

2134
02:53:13,767 --> 02:53:16,549
I know you have received
orders from our commandant,

2135
02:53:17,562 --> 02:53:19,470
which he has received
from his superiors,

2136
02:53:19,531 --> 02:53:21,659
to dispose of the population
of this camp.

2137
02:53:23,068 --> 02:53:24,549
Now would be the time to do it.

2138
02:53:25,362 --> 02:53:26,708
Here they are, they're all here.

2139
02:53:28,721 --> 02:53:30,053
This is your opportunity.

2140
02:53:35,257 --> 02:53:36,930
Or you could leave

2141
02:53:39,125 --> 02:53:40,988
and return to your families as men

2142
02:53:41,729 --> 02:53:42,802
instead of murderers.

2143
02:54:25,922 --> 02:54:28,538
In memory of the countless
victims among your people,

2144
02:54:29,945 --> 02:54:32,428
I ask us to observe
three minutes of silence.

2145
02:55:28,930 --> 02:55:29,844
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

2146
02:55:30,376 --> 02:55:31,534
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

2147
02:55:32,072 --> 02:55:33,366
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

2148
02:55:33,426 --> 02:55:34,573
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

2149
02:55:34,634 --> 02:55:35,247
Open wide.

2150
02:55:38,220 --> 02:55:39,467
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

2151
02:55:58,821 --> 02:56:00,137
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

2152
02:56:25,401 --> 02:56:27,903
As soon as peace occurs, I want...

2153
02:56:30,384 --> 02:56:32,475
I want that cloth
distributed to the workers.

2154
02:56:33,716 --> 02:56:34,961
Two and a half meters each.

2155
02:56:36,469 --> 02:56:38,720
Also, each person is to
get a bottle of vodka.

2156
02:56:39,848 --> 02:56:41,755
They won't drink it.
They know its value.

2157
02:56:42,767 --> 02:56:45,187
Likewise those Egipshi
cigarettes we organized.

2158
02:56:46,396 --> 02:56:48,511
It'll be done.
Everything you ask.

2159
02:57:09,831 --> 02:57:10,914
We've written a letter,

2160
02:57:11,627 --> 02:57:13,014
trying to explain things

2161
02:57:14,163 --> 02:57:15,502
in case you are captured.

2162
02:57:18,511 --> 02:57:20,135
Every worker has signed it.

2163
02:57:31,814 --> 02:57:32,808
Thank you.

2164
02:58:00,771 --> 02:58:02,773
It is Hebrew, from the Talmud.

2165
02:58:02,884 --> 02:58:06,406
It says, 'Whoever saves one
life, saves the world entire.'

2166
02:58:47,770 --> 02:58:49,693
I could have got more out.

2167
02:58:52,582 --> 02:58:53,874
I could have got more.

2168
02:58:54,425 --> 02:58:55,130
I don't know.

2169
02:58:55,223 --> 02:58:56,183
If I just...

2170
02:58:58,695 --> 02:58:59,742
I could have got more.

2171
02:58:59,803 --> 02:59:04,104
Oskar, there are 1,100 people who are
alive because of you. Look at them.

2172
02:59:05,716 --> 02:59:07,091
If I'd made more money.

2173
02:59:12,088 --> 02:59:15,243
I threw away so much money.

2174
02:59:19,025 --> 02:59:20,325
You have no idea.

2175
02:59:21,958 --> 02:59:22,932
If I had just...

2176
02:59:23,819 --> 02:59:26,404
There will be generations
because of what you did.

2177
02:59:28,218 --> 02:59:29,696
I didn't do enough.

2178
02:59:31,020 --> 02:59:32,169
You did so much.

2179
02:59:37,138 --> 02:59:38,098
This car.

2180
02:59:39,977 --> 02:59:41,476
Goeth would've bought this car.

2181
02:59:42,155 --> 02:59:43,561
Why did I keep the car?

2182
02:59:44,081 --> 02:59:45,663
Ten people right there.

2183
02:59:49,454 --> 02:59:50,484
Ten people.

2184
02:59:53,082 --> 02:59:54,059
Ten more people.

2185
02:59:57,503 --> 02:59:58,324
This pin...

2186
02:59:59,285 --> 03:00:00,205
Two people.

2187
03:00:03,784 --> 03:00:04,618
This is gold.

2188
03:00:05,720 --> 03:00:06,646
Two more people.

2189
03:00:07,543 --> 03:00:09,762
He would have given me
two for it, at least one.

2190
03:00:10,665 --> 03:00:12,634
He would have given me one, one more.

2191
03:00:16,382 --> 03:00:17,362
One more person.

2192
03:00:20,672 --> 03:00:22,112
A person, Stern.

2193
03:00:24,424 --> 03:00:25,181
For this.

2194
03:00:28,636 --> 03:00:31,500
I could have gotten

2195
03:00:32,332 --> 03:00:33,436
one more person,

2196
03:00:34,609 --> 03:00:35,523
and I didn't.

2197
03:00:37,386 --> 03:00:38,689
And I didn't!

2198
03:02:09,541 --> 03:02:11,599
You have been liberated

2199
03:02:12,338 --> 03:02:14,249
by the Soviet Army!

2200
03:02:22,940 --> 03:02:24,328
Have you been in Poland?

2201
03:02:24,815 --> 03:02:26,288
I just came from Poland.

2202
03:02:29,489 --> 03:02:30,589
Are there any Jews left?

2203
03:02:37,371 --> 03:02:38,701
Where should we go?

2204
03:02:39,893 --> 03:02:41,980
Don't go east, that's for sure.

2205
03:02:42,143 --> 03:02:43,073
They hate you there.

2206
03:02:45,548 --> 03:02:47,767
I wouldn't go west either,
if I were you.

2207
03:02:50,426 --> 03:02:51,865
We could use some food.

2208
03:02:55,082 --> 03:02:57,293
Isn't there a town over there?

2209
03:04:12,174 --> 03:04:13,101
Heil Hitler.
