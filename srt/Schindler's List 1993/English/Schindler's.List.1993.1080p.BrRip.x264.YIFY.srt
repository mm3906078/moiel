You could make other things,
couldn't you?

no longer own businesses.

feel in their hands.

1372

He came down to the basement

1373
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:12,757
He asked me where they were.

For his dogs, you understand.

I don't know how I say this.

I never could say it now,

"Why are you beating me?"

1378
01:40:35,988 --> 01:40:39,583
He said, "The reason
I beat you now

1379
01:40:39,659 --> 01:40:43,289
is because you
ask why I beat you."

I know your sufferings, Helen.

It doesn't matter.

1382
01:40:54,882 --> 01:40:56,976
I have accepted them.

1383
01:40:58,094 --> 01:40:59,596
Accepted them?

1384
01:41:01,889 --> 01:41:03,732
One day he will shoot me.

1385

No, no, no, he won't shoot you.

I know. I see things.

1387
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:13,739
We were on the roof on Monday,
young Lisiek and I,

1388
01:41:13,818 --> 01:41:17,322
and we saw the <i>Herr Kommandant</i>
come out of the from door

1389
01:41:17,405 --> 01:41:23,253
and down the steps by the
patio, right there below us,

1390
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:28,083
and there on the steps
he drew his gun and he

1391
01:41:28,165 --> 01:41:31,009
shot a woman who
was passing by.

1392
01:41:32,378 --> 01:41:35,632
A woman carrying a bundle.
Through the throat.

1393
01:41:35,715 --> 01:41:39,390
Just a woman on her way
somewhere, you know?

1394
01:41:39,468 --> 01:41:43,098
She was no fatter or thinner

1395
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:45,774
or slower or faster
than anyone else,

1396
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:50,026
and I couldn't
guess what had she done.

1397
01:41:54,525 --> 01:41:57,699
The more you see of
the <i>Herr Kommandant,</i>

1398
01:41:57,778 --> 01:42:03,376
the more you see there is no set
rules that you can live by.

1399
01:42:03,451 --> 01:42:08,173
You can't say to yourself, "If I
follow these rules, I will be safe."

1400
01:42:11,834 --> 01:42:15,839
He won't shoot you because
he enjoys you too much.

1401
01:42:16,464 --> 01:42:20,469
He enjoys you so much he won't
even let you wear the star.

1402
01:42:20,551 --> 01:42:22,144
He doesn't want
anyone else to know

1403
01:42:22,219 --> 01:42:24,938
it's a Jew he's enjoying.

1404
01:42:28,559 --> 01:42:31,187
He shot the woman
from the steps

1405
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:34,991
because she meant
nothing to him.

or pleasing him.

The trains arrived and the people
were driven out with clubs.

No.

1964
02:25:34,684 --> 02:25:35,685
One hand of 21.

1965
02:25:35,810 --> 02:25:36,857
No.

1966
02:25:36,937 --> 02:25:39,736
If you win, I pay you
7,400 reichsmarks. No.

1967

Wouldn't be right.

1972
02:25:51,409 --> 02:25:53,161
She's just going to Auschwitz
Number Two, anyway.

1973
02:25:53,245 --> 02:25:55,122
What difference does it make?
She's not going to Auschwitz.

1974
02:25:55,205 --> 02:25:57,503
I'd never do that to her.
No, I want her

1975
02:25:57,624 --> 02:25:59,922
to come back to Vienna with me.

1976
02:26:00,001 --> 02:26:02,971
I want her to come
to work for me there.

1977

her to Vienna with you.

1980

merciful thing.

1984

Good morning.

A mistake has been made. We

We work for Oskar Schindler.
We are Schindler Jews.

Who is Oskar Schindler?

2122
02:38:39,552 --> 02:38:41,179
He had a factory in Krakow.

2123
02:38:41,262 --> 02:38:42,639
Enamelware.

2124
02:38:43,472 --> 02:38:45,065

<i>Herr</i> Schindler.

2128
02:39:00,948 --> 02:39:03,622
I remember earlier this year,
IG Farben ordered

2129
02:39:03,701 --> 02:39:07,956
a trainload of Hungarians
for its chemical factory.

2130
02:39:09,749 --> 02:39:12,468
The train came in
through the archway

2131
02:39:13,669 --> 02:39:17,515
and the officer in charge of the
selection went immediately to work

2132
02:39:19,467 --> 02:39:21,310
and sent 2,000 of them

2133
02:39:22,094 --> 02:39:24,267
straight away to
Special Treatment.

2134
02:39:26,474 --> 02:39:28,647
It is not my task
to interfere with

2135
02:39:28,809 --> 02:39:31,028
the processes that
take place down here.

2136
02:39:33,147 --> 02:39:37,618
Why do you think I can help you
if I can't help IG Farben?

2137
02:39:38,319 --> 02:39:40,196
Allow me to express the reason.

2138
02:39:50,247 --> 02:39:52,750
I'm not making any
judgment about you.

2139
02:39:53,542 --> 02:39:56,295
It's just that I know
that in the coming months,

2140
02:39:56,378 --> 02:39:59,052
we're all going to
need portable wealth.

2141
02:40:02,718 --> 02:40:04,812
I could have you arrested.

2142
02:40:05,471 --> 02:40:09,271
I'm protected by powerful friends.
You should know that.

2143
02:40:13,270 --> 02:40:15,739
I do not say I
am accepting them.

2144
02:40:17,316 --> 02:40:20,445
All I say is, I'm not comfortable
with them on the table.

2145
02:40:36,085 --> 02:40:38,338
I have a shipment
coming in tomorrow.

from the Armaments Board.

2223
02:47:23,534 --> 02:47:25,662
The artillery shells,

2224
02:47:25,744 --> 02:47:28,293
apparently all of them have
failed quality control tests.

Have you been in Poland?

2384
03:02:24,725 --> 03:02:25,977
I just came from Poland.

2385
03:02:29,439 --> 03:02:31,191
Are there any Jews left?

2386
03:02:37,321 --> 03:02:38,823
Where should we go?

east, that's for sure.

2388
03:02:42,160 --> 03:02:43,753
They hate you there.

2389
03:02:45,538 --> 03:02:47,757
I wouldn't go west either,
if I were you.

2390
03:02:50,376 --> 03:02:52,344
We could use some food.

2391
03:02:55,047 --> 03:02:57,391
Isn't there a town over there?
