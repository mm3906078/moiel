00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,866
I better get back to the office.

3
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,035
These extended lunch hours
give my boss excess acid.

4
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,537
Why don't you call your boss and tell him

5
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,956
you're taking the rest of the afternoon off?

6
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,417
Friday anyway, and hot.

7
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,671
What do I do with my free afternoon?
Walk you to the airport?

8

Well, we could laze around here

Oh, Sam, I hate having to be with you
in a place like this.

14
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,731
I've heard of married couples
who deliberately spend

15

an occasional night in a cheap hotel.

When you're married you can do
a lot of things deliberately.

Oh, Sam, this is the last time.

19
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,162
- Yeah? For what?
- For this.

20
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,499
For meeting you in secret
so we can be secretive.

and we steal lunch hours.

I wish you wouldn't even come.

23
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,762
All right. What do we do instead?
Write each other lurid love letters?

24
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,056
Oh, I have to go, Sam.

25

- I can come down next week.
- No.

26
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:35,191
Not even just to see you?
Have lunch, in public?

00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,695
Oh, we can see each other.
We can even have dinner.

28
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,239
But respectably.

29

In my house,
with my mother's picture on the mantel

30
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,621
and my sister helping me broil
a big steak for three.

31
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,623
And after the steak,

32
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,292
do we send sister to the movies,
turn Mama's picture to the wall?

All right.

Marion, whenever it's possible,
I want to see you.

36
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:12,228
And under any circumstances,
even respectability.

37
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:16,482
You make respectability
sound disrespectful.

38
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,150
Oh, no, I'm all for it.

39
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:21,821
It requires patience, temperance,
a lot of sweating out.

40
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:25,157
Otherwise, though, it's just hard work.

41
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:30,830
But if I can see you and touch you,
even as simply as this, I won't mind.

42
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,918
I'm tired of sweating for people
who aren't there.

43
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,046
I sweat to pay off my father's debts,
and he's in his grave.

44
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,339
I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony,

45
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:44,135
and she's living on the other side
of the world somewhere.

46
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,346
I pay, too.

47
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,434
They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.

48
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,855
A couple of years
and my debts will be paid off.

49
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,524
If she ever remarries, the alimony stops.

50
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:02,987
- I haven't even been married once yet.
- Yeah. But when you do, you'll swing.

51
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,197
Oh, Sam, let's get married.

52
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,623
Yeah. And live with me in a storeroom
behind a hardware store in Fairvale?

53
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,835
We'll have lots of laughs. I'll tell you what.

54
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,547
When I send my ex-wife her alimony,
you can lick the stamps.

55
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,466
I'll lick the stamps.

56
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,226
Marion, you want to cut this off,

57
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,771
go out and find yourself
somebody available?

58
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,647

How could you even think a thing like that?

- Don't miss your plane.
- Hey, we can leave together, can't we?

who's buying the Harris Street property.

You know, the oil lease man.
That's why he's late. You got a headache?

you forget them
as soon as they stop hurting.

I've got something, not aspirin.

the day of my wedding.

I'd taken tranquilisers.

May I see your licence?

157
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,419
- Why?
- Please.

- I'm in no mood for trouble.
- What?

161
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,991
There's an old saying. "The first customer
of the day is always the most trouble."

162
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,701
But like I say, I'm in no mood for it,

163
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:25,080
so I'm gonna treat you so fair and square
that you won't have one human reason...

164
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,332
Can I trade my car in and take another?

165
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,545
Do anything you have a mind to.
Being a woman, you will. That yours?

166
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,922
Yes, it's... There's nothing wrong with it.

167
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,508
- I just...
- Sick of the sight of it.

168
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,717
Why don't you have a look around here

169
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,219
and see if there's something
that strikes your eyes.

170
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,304
And meanwhile, I'll have my mechanic
give yours the once-over.

171
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,348
- You want some coffee? I was just about...
- No, thank you.

172
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,809
I'm in a hurry
and I just wanna make a change.

173
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,352
One thing people never ought to be

174
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,396
when they're buying used cars
and that's in a hurry.

175
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,400
But like I said, it's too nice a day to argue.
I'll shoot your car in the garage here.

(STARTS ENGINE)

178
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,883
That's the one I'd have
picked for you myself.

179
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,092
- How much?
- Go ahead.

180
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,678
- Spin it around the block.
- It looks fine.

181
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,722
How much would it be with my car?

182
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:27,893
You mean you don't want the usual day
and a half to think it over?

183
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,937
You are in a hurry, aren't you?
Somebody chasing you?

184
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,981
Of course not. Please.

185
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:37,777
Well, it's the first time the customer
ever high-pressured the salesman.

186
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,989
I figure roughly

187
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,702
your car plus $700.

188
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:50,332
- $700.
- You always got time to argue money, huh?

189
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,918
All right.

190
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,425
I take it you can prove that car is yours.

191
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,470
I mean, out-of-state licence and all.
You got your pink slip...

192
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:07,349
I believe I have the necessary papers.
Is there a ladies' room?

193
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,059
In the building.

194
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,738
Over there.

195
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:21,214
I think you better take it for a trial spin.

196
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,883
I don't want any bad word of mouth
about California Charlie.

197
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,970
I'd really rather not.
Can't we just settle this and...

198
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,597
I might as well be perfectly
honest with you, ma'am.

199
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,392
- It's not that I don't trust you, but...
- But what?

200
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,310
Is there anything so terribly wrong

201
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:37,355
about making a decision
and wanting to hurry?

202
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,608
- Do you think I've stolen my car?
- No, ma'am.

<i>LOWERY: Caroline, Marion still isn't in?</i>

217
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:19,958
CAROLINE: No, Mr Lowery, but then
<i>she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.</i>

218
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,584
<i>LOWERY: Buzz me the minute she comes in.</i>

219
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,965
<i>And call her sister.</i>
<i>No one's answering at the house.</i>

220
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,425
CAROLINE: I called hersister, Mr Lowery,
<i>where she works,</i>

221
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,511
<i>the Music Makers Music Store, you know,</i>

222
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,222
<i>and she doesn't know where Marion is</i>
<i>any more than we do.</i>

<i>LOWERY: You better run out to the house.</i>

<i>She may be,</i>
<i>well, unable to answer the phone.</i>

225
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:41,062
CAROLINE: Hersister's going to do that.
<i>She's as worried as we are.</i>

<i>LOWERY: No, I haven't the faintest idea.</i>

227
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,488
<i>As I said, I last saw your sister</i>
<i>when she left this office on Friday.</i>

228
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:54,117

<i>After all, Cassidy, I told you, all that cash!</i>

<i>She sat there while I dumped it out!</i>

Oh, we have 12 vacancies.
Twelve cabins, 12 vacancies.

251
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,132
They... They moved away the highway.

252
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:41,803
Oh, I thought I'd gotten off the main road.

253

I knew you must have.

254

Nobody ever stops here any more
unless they've done that.

255

But there's no sense dwelling on our losses.

It's closer in case you want anything.

Right next to the office.

261
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,261
I want sleep more than anything else,
except maybe food.

262
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:27,098
Well, there's a big diner about 10 miles
up the road, just outside of Fairvale.

263
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:31,352
- Am I that close to Fairvale?
- Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.

Boy, it's stuffy in here.

266
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,798
Well, the mattress is soft

267
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,511
and there's hangers in the closet and
stationery with Bates Motel printed on it

268
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:08,973
in case you wanna make
your friends back home feel envious.

269
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,558

- Over there.
- The bathroom.

271
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,939
Yeah.

272
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:22,028
Well, if you want anything,
just tap on the wall.

273
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:24,405
- I'll be in the office.
- Thank you, Mr Bates.

275
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:32,997
You're not really gonna go out again
and drive up to the diner, are you?

276
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,332
No.

277
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:37,335
Well, then would you do me a favour?
Would you have dinner with me?

278
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:38,878
I was just about to myself.

279
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,297
You know, nothing special,
just sandwiches and milk.

280
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:45,051
But I'd like it very much
if you'd come up to the house.

281
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:49,931
I don't set a fancy table,
but the kitchen's awful homey.

282
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,433
- I'd like to.
- All right.

283
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:55,186
You get yourself settled
and take off your wet shoes,

284
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,021
and I'll be back as soon as it's ready.

289
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:28,821
I won't have you bringing
strange young girls in for supper!

By candlelight, I suppose,
in the cheap, erotic fashion

Music? Whispers?

294
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:43,002
NORMAN: Mother, she's just a stranger.
She's hungry and it's raining out.

295
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:48,466
MRS. BATES: "Mother, she's just a stranger."
As if men don't desire strangers. As if...

296
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:52,762
(SHUDDERING) I refuse to speak of
disgusting things, because they disgust me!

297
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,139
You understand, boy? Go on.

298
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,392
Go tell her she'll not be appeasing
her ugly appetite

299
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,895
with my food or my son!

300
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:04,315
Or do I have to tell her
'cause you don't have the guts?

301
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,985
- Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
- NORMAN: Shut up! Shut up!

(DOOR CLOSES)

304
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,947
- I've caused you some trouble.
- No.

305
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,450
Mother... My mother...

306
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,953
What is the phrase?

307
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,123
She isn't quite herself today.

308
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:06,752
You shouldn't have bothered.
I really don't have that much of an appetite.

309
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,297
Oh, I'm sorry.

310
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,928
I wish you could apologise for other people.

311
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,264
Don't worry about it.

312
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:21,934
But as long as you've fixed a supper,
we may as well eat it.

313
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:36,991
It might be nicer and warmer in the office.

314
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,132
Well, it stopped raining.

315
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,760
Eating in an office is just too officious.

316
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:56,927
(CHUCKLES)

317
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:59,722
- I have the parlour back here.
- All right.

318
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,865
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

319
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:23,037
You're very kind.

320
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,374
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Go ahead.

321
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,217
You... You eat like a bird.

322
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:39,804
And you'd know, of course.

323
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,097
No, not really.

324
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,559
Anyway, I hear the expression
"Eats like a bird"

325
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:49,730
is really a false... Falsity.

326
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:53,526
Because birds really eat a tremendous lot.

327
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:59,698
But I don't really know
anything about birds.

328
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,617
My hobby is stuffing things.

329
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,536
You know, taxidermy.

330
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:07,581
And I guess
I'd just rather stuff birds because

331
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,835
I hate the look of beasts
when they're stuffed.

332
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,878
You know, foxes and chimps.

333
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:16,882
Some people even stuff dogs and cats,
but, oh, I can't do that.

334
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:19,885
I think only birds look
well stuffed because...

335
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:23,430
Well, because they're
kind of passive to begin with.

336
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,892
It's a strange hobby. Curious.

337
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,354
- Uncommon, too.
- Oh, I imagine so.

338
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:34,441
And it's not as expensive as you'd think.
It's cheap, really.

339
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:37,069
You know, needles and thread, sawdust.

340
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,905
The chemicals are the only thing
that cost anything.

341
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,074
A man should have a hobby.

342
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:46,662
Well, it's... It's more than a hobby.

343
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:52,042
A hobby's supposed to pass the time,
not fill it.

344
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,753
Is your time so empty?

345
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:55,963
No.

346
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,925
Well, I run the office

347
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,428
and tend the cabins and grounds

348
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:05,222
and do little errands for my mother.

349
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:08,642
The ones she allows
I might be capable of doing.

350
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,353
Do you go out with friends?

351
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:17,234
Well, a boy's best friend is his mother.

352
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:23,449
You've never had an empty moment
in your entire life, have you?

353
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,662
- Only my share.
- Where are you going?

354
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,542
I didn't mean to pry.

355
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:36,045
I'm looking for a private island.

356
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,798
What are you running away from?

357
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:44,386
- Why do you ask that?
- I don't know.

358
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:48,974
People never run away from anything.

359
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:55,314
The rain didn't last long, did it?
You know what I think?

360
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,108
I think that

361
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,821
we're all in our private traps,

362
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,867
clamped in them,
and none of us can ever get out.

363
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,455
We scratch and claw,

364
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:15,084
but only at the air, only at each other.

365
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:19,546
And for all of it, we never budge an inch.

366
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,926
Sometimes we deliberately step
into those traps.

367
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:29,348
I was born in mine. I don't mind it any more.

368
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,101
Oh, but you should. You should mind it.

369
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,395
Oh, I do, but I say I don't.

370
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:41,568
You know, if anyone ever
talked to me the way I heard,

371
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,405
the way she spoke to you...

372
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:49,201
Sometimes when she talks to me like that,

373
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:54,248
I feel I'd like to go up there
and curse her and leave her forever.

374
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,750
Or at least defy her.

375
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:03,173
But I know I can't.

376
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,260
She's ill.

377
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,595
She sounded strong.

378
00:39:09,723 --> 00:39:11,432
No, I mean ill.

379
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:17,354
She had to raise me all by herself,
after my father died.

380
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:21,025
I was only five and it must've been
quite a strain for her.

381
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,569
I mean, she didn't have to go to work
or anything like that.

382
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:25,779
He left her a little money.

383
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,117
Anyway, a few years ago,
Mother met this man.

384
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,954
And he talked her into building this motel.

385
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:36,373
He could have talked her into anything.

386
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:40,711
And when he died, too,
it was just too great a shock for her.

387
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,048
And the way he died...

388
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,092
(CHUCKLES)

389
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:50,721
I guess it's nothing to talk
about while you're eating.

390
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:55,267
Anyway, it was just too great a loss for her.
She had nothing left.

391
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,437
Except you.

392
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,983
Well, a son is a poor substitute for a lover.

393
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,819
Why don't you go away?

394
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,656
To a private island, like you?

395
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,077
(SIGHS)

396
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,662
No, not like me.

397
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:19,833
I couldn't do that. Who'd look after her?

398
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,462
She'd be alone up there.

399
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,256
Her fire would go out.

400
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:29,510
It'd be cold and damp like a grave.

401
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,846
If you love someone,

402
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:36,183
you don't do that to them,
even if you hate them.

403
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,728
You understand, I don't hate her.

404
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,649
I hate what she's become.

405
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,443
I hate the illness.

406
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,572
Wouldn't it be better if you put her

407
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,867
someplace...

408
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,249
You mean an institution? A madhouse?

409
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:07,881
People always call a madhouse
"someplace," don't they?

410
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,050
Put her in someplace.

411
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:14,596
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it to sound uncaring.

412
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,933
What do you know about caring?

413
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:21,145
Have you ever seen the inside
of one of those places?

414
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,480
The laughing and the tears

415
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:27,025
and the cruel eyes studying you.

416
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,819
My mother there?

417
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,906
(CHUCKLES) But she's harmless.

418
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:38,745
She's as harmless
as one of those stuffed birds.

419
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,248
I am sorry.

420
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:46,044
I only felt... It seems she's hurting you.

421
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:50,674
- I meant well.
- People always mean well.

422
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,219
They cluck their thick tongues
and shake their heads

423
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:56,930
and suggest, oh, so very delicately.

424
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,940
Of course, I've suggested it myself.

425
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,069
But I hate to even think about it.

426
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:13,322
She needs me.

427
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,703
It's not as if she were

428
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,581
a maniac, a raving thing.

429
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:28,045
She just goes a little mad sometimes.

430
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,508
We all go a little mad sometimes.

431
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:37,638
Haven't you?

432
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:40,849
Yes.

433
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:44,853
Sometimes just one time can be enough.

434
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:47,981
Thank you.

435
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:51,151
Thank you, Norman.

436
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:52,486
Norman.

437
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,616
Oh, you're not going back
to your room already?

438
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,576
I'm very tired.

439
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:03,497
And I have a long drive tomorrow,
all the way back to Phoenix.

440
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,165
Really?

441
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:09,002
I stepped into a private trap back there

442
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:13,465
and I'd like to go back
and try to pull myself out of it

443
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,760
before it's too late for me, too.

444
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,638
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to stay just a little while longer?

445
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,640
Just for talk?

446
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,934
Oh, I'd like to, but...

447
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,269
All right.

448
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:28,981
Well, I'll see you in the morning.
I'll bring you some breakfast, all right?

449
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:31,858
- What time?
- Very early. Dawn.

450
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,902
All right, Miss...

451
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:36,280
- Crane.
- Crane. That's it.

452
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:37,823
Good night.

every insect in the world,

and nothing more?

Not even a hunch. Just hope.

I could get to believe you.

She's not in any trouble.

for people who aren't in trouble.

- I'm not the police.
- Oh, yeah.

We have reason to believe
that she came along this way.

Well, she may have used an alias.

Marion Crane's her real name,

582
01:06:14,262 --> 01:06:17,514
but she could've registered
under a different one.

583
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:22,102
Well, I tell you, I don't even much bother
with guests registering any more.

You know, one by one,
you drop the formalities.

585
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:27,316
I shouldn't even bother
changing the sheets,

586
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,652
but old habits die hard.

587

- It's the light. The sign.

We had a couple last week,
said if the thing hadn't been on,

they would've thought
this was an old, deserted...

01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:43,207
Well, you see, that's exactly my point.

592
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:45,167
You said that nobody'd been here
for a couple weeks,

593
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:48,045
and there's a couple came by
and didn't know that you were open.

594
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:49,129
Yeah.

595
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:51,507
Well, as you say, old habits die hard.

596
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:54,510
It's possible, this girl could've registered
under another name.

597
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:56,220
Do you mind if I look at your book?

598
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:58,263
- No.
- Thank you.

599
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:02,518
All right.

600
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:04,853
I'll get the date somewhere.

601
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:07,940
See, there's nobody.

602
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:11,777
Let's see now, I have a sample of her
handwriting here.

603
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:14,905
Oh, yes.

606
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,997
- Is that her?
- Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

607
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:26,083
Marie, Marion.

608
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,836

Mmm-hmm.

01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:32,840
Was she in disguise, by any chance?

611
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:37,761
- Wanna check the picture again?
- Look, I wasn't lying to you, Mr...

01:07:37,846 --> 01:07:39,888
Oh, I know that. I know you wouldn't lie.

You know, it's tough keeping track
of the time around here.

Oh, I know, I know.

615
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:46,061
Oh, yeah.

616
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:48,313
Well, it was raining

617
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,358
and her hair was all wet.

618
01:07:51,443 --> 01:07:54,153
I tell you, it's not really
a very good picture of her either.

619

No, I guess not.

620

Tell me all about her.

621
01:07:57,532 --> 01:07:58,824
Well,

622
01:07:59,284 --> 01:08:03,537
she arrived rather late one night,
and she went straight to sleep

623
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:06,248
and left early the next morning.

624
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:09,460
- How early?
- Oh, very early.

625
01:08:09,544 --> 01:08:12,755
Mmm-hmm. Which morning was that?

626

- The next morning. Sunday.
- I see.

- Did anyone meet her here?
- No.

- Did she arrive with anyone?
- No.

630

- Did she make any phone calls or...
- No.

631

632
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,858
Did you spend the night with her?

633
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,359
No.

634
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:38,238
Well then, how would you know
that she didn't make any phone calls?

(STAMMERING)

636
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,911
Well, she was very tired and...

637
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:47,289
See, now I'm starting to remember.

638
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:48,957
I'm making a mental picture of it in my mind.

639

You know, if you make a mental
picturisation of something...

That's right. That's right. Take your time.

641
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:56,048
She was... She was sitting back there...

642
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:59,051
No, no, she was standing back there
with a sandwich in her hand

643
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,803
and she said she had to go to sleep early

644
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:05,891
because she had a long drive ahead of her.

645
01:09:06,518 --> 01:09:08,477
- Back where?
- Back where she came from.

646
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:11,355
No, you said before that she was
sitting back there... Standing back there...

Yes, back in my parlour there.

648
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:16,109
She was very hungry
and I made her a sandwich

649
01:09:16,194 --> 01:09:21,615
and then she said that she was tired
and she had to go right to bed.

650
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,867
I see. How did she pay you?

651
01:09:23,952 --> 01:09:25,285
- Cash? Cheque?
- Cash.

652

Cash, huh?

653
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:31,458
- And after she left, she didn't come back?
- Well, why should she?

01:09:31,543 --> 01:09:32,543

and this ain't jelling.

what you could expect me to know.

- No.

- No.

Oh? There's somebody
sitting up in the window.

- No, no, there isn't.
- Sure, go ahead. Take a look.

Oh, I see.

Now, if this girl, Marion Crane, were here,
you wouldn't be hiding her, would you?

01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:04,009
- No.
- Not even if she paid you well?

No.

680
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:10,933
Let's just say, just for the sake of argument,
that she wanted you to gallantly protect her.

681
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:12,893
You'd know that you were being used.

682

You wouldn't be made a fool of, would you?

683
01:11:14,354 --> 01:11:15,938
- But I'm not a fool.
- Well, I...

684

And I'm not capable of being fooled,
not even by a woman.

685

- Well, this is not a slur on your manhood.
- Let's put it this way.

686
01:11:21,653 --> 01:11:25,530
She might have fooled me,
but she didn't fool my mother.

687
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:27,532
Well, then your mother met her.
Could I talk to your mother?

688
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:30,285
No. As I told you, she's confined.

Yes, but just for a few minutes. That's all.

- Just for a moment. I wouldn't disturb her.

- I think I've talked to you all I want to.
- Yes, but just for...

if you'd let me talk to her.

- Would I need a warrant for that, too?
- Sure.

Yes, she spent last Saturday night

but I think I got all there was to get.

01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:45,089
That must be the Bates Motel.

770
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:48,092
He traced her there and called us to say
he was going to question Mrs Bates.

771
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:49,761
Norman took a wife?

772
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:53,181
SAM: No, I don't think so.
An old woman. His mother.

773
01:20:53,641 --> 01:20:56,684
Well, anyway, that was early this evening.
We haven't seen or heard from him since.

774
01:20:56,769 --> 01:21:00,271
Now, your sister's missing how long?

775
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:03,525
Well, she left Phoenix a week ago yesterday,
without a trace.

776
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:07,111
How'd you and this detective
come to trace her to Fairvale?

777
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:09,364
They thought she'd be coming to me.

778
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:11,783
- Left Phoenix under her own steam?
- Yes.

779
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:14,452
She's not missing so much
as she's run away.

780
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:16,788
- SAM: That's right.
- From what?

781
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:22,335
- She stole some money.
- SHERIFF: A lot?

782
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:25,713
$40,000.

783
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:27,882
And the police haven't been able to...

784
01:21:27,967 --> 01:21:31,803
Everyone concerned thought if they
could get her to give the money back,

785
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:34,347
they could avoid involving her
with the police.

786
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:38,351
That explains the private detective.
He traced her to the Bates place.

787
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:40,895
What exactly did he say
when he called you?

788
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:44,774
Well, he said that Marion was there
for one night and then she left.

789
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:46,568
With the $40,000?

790
01:21:47,278 --> 01:21:49,404
Well, he didn't say anything
about the money.

791
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:51,906
It isn't important what
he said on the phone, is it?

792
01:21:51,991 --> 01:21:53,575
He was supposed to come back here
and talk to us

793
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:55,743
after he talked to the mother, and he didn't.

794
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:58,037
That's what I want you
to do something about.

795
01:21:58,122 --> 01:21:59,622
Like what?

796
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:02,125
I'm sorry if I seem overanxious.

797
01:22:02,209 --> 01:22:05,920
It's just that I'm sure there's something
wrong out there and I have to know what.

798
01:22:06,005 --> 01:22:09,465
Well, I think there's something wrong
too, miss, but not the same thing.

799
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:12,719
I think what's wrong is
your private detective.

800
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:16,764
I think he got himself a hot lead
as to where your sister was going,

801
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:18,933
probably from Norman Bates,

802
01:22:19,018 --> 01:22:23,229
and called you to keep you still
while he took off after her and the money.

803
01:22:23,314 --> 01:22:27,150
No, no, he said he was dissatisfied
and he was going back there.

804
01:22:27,234 --> 01:22:29,611
Why don't you call Norman
and let him say just what happened?

805
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:31,070
SHERIFF: At this hour?

806
01:22:31,155 --> 01:22:33,364
Well, he was out
when I was there just a while ago.

807
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:35,491
If he's back,
he probably isn't even in bed yet.

808
01:22:35,576 --> 01:22:37,118
He wasn't out when you were there,

809
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:40,538
he just wasn't answering the door
in the dead of night, like some people do.

810
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:42,874
This fellow lives like a hermit.

811
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:46,085
You must remember that bad business
out there about 10 years ago.

812
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,795
Please. Call.

813
01:22:54,053 --> 01:22:58,222
Florrie, the Sheriff wants you to
connect him with the Bates Motel.

814
01:23:04,313 --> 01:23:06,898
Hello, Norman? Sheriff Chambers.

815
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:10,318
I've been just fine, thanks.

816
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:12,570
Listen, we got worries here.

817
01:23:13,155 --> 01:23:16,574
Yeah, have you had a fella
stop by there tonight...

818
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:20,036
Well, this one wouldn't be
a customer, anyway.

819
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:23,081
- He's a private detective, name of...
- Arbogast.

820
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:24,749
Arbogast.

821
01:23:28,295 --> 01:23:30,254
And after he left?

822
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:34,133
No, that's okay, Norman.

823
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:36,386
(HANGS UP PHONE)

824
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:39,847
This detective was there,
Norman told him about the girl,

825
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:42,809
the detective thanked him
and he went away.

826
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:46,813
And he didn't come back?
He didn't see the mother?

827
01:23:46,897 --> 01:23:49,148
Your detective told you
he couldn't come right back

828
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:53,111
because he was going to question
Norman Bates' mother, right?

829
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:54,320
Yes.

830
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:57,740
Norman Bates' mother has
been dead and buried

831
01:23:57,825 --> 01:24:00,910
in Green Lawn Cemetery
for the past 10 years.

832
01:24:02,413 --> 01:24:06,124
I helped Norman pick out the dress
she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

833
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:07,875
SHERIFF: It ain't only local history, Sam.

834
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:11,754
It's the only case of murder and suicide
on Fairvale ledgers.

835
01:24:11,839 --> 01:24:16,300
Mrs Bates poisoned this guy
she was involved with

836
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:18,636
when she found out he was married.

837
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:21,806
Then took a helping
of the same stuff herself.

838
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:24,809
Strychnine. Ugly way to die.

839
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:28,062
Norman found them dead together.

840
01:24:28,147 --> 01:24:29,355
(WHISPERING) In bed.

841
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:33,985
You mean that old woman I saw sitting in
the window out there wasn't Bates' mother?

842
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:38,114
Now, wait a minute, Sam.
Are you sure you saw an old woman?

843
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:40,658
Yes! In the house behind the motel!

844
01:24:40,743 --> 01:24:43,035
I called and pounded
but she just ignored me!

845
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,872
You want to tell me
you saw Norman Bates' mother?

846
01:24:45,956 --> 01:24:49,167
But it had to be
because Arbogast said so, too!

847
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:52,920
And the young man wouldn't let him
see her because she was too ill.

848
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:55,882
Well, if the woman up there is Mrs Bates,

849
01:24:57,217 --> 01:25:00,511
who's that woman buried out
in Green Lawn Cemetery?

850
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:47,266
NORMAN: Now, Mother,
I'm gonna bring something up...

(MRS. BATES LAUGHS)

852

MRS. BATES: I am sorry, boy,

853
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:53,940
but you do manage to look ludicrous
when you give me orders.

854
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:55,650
NORMAN: Please, Mother.

855
01:25:55,734 --> 01:25:58,653
MRS. BATES: No!
I will not hide in the fruit cellar.

You think I'm fruity, huh?

858
01:26:02,282 --> 01:26:04,367
I'm staying right here.

859
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:07,286
This is my room
and no one will drag me out of it,

860
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:10,498
least of all my big, bold son.

861
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:11,666
NORMAN: They'll come now, Mother.

862
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:15,670
He came after the girl,
and now someone will come after him.

863
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:17,505
Mother, please, it's just for a few days.

864
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:20,007
Just for a few days so they won't find you.

865
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:21,884
MRS. BATES: Just for a few days?

866
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:25,638
In that dark, dank fruit cellar? No!

867
01:26:26,265 --> 01:26:29,642
You hid me there once, boy,
and you won't do it again, not ever again!

868
01:26:29,726 --> 01:26:31,269
Now get out!

869
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:36,274
- I told you to get out, boy.
- NORMAN: I'll carry you, Mother.

870
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:39,569
MRS. BATES: Norman,
what do you think you're doing?

871
01:26:39,653 --> 01:26:42,947
Don't you touch me! Don't! Norman!

872
01:26:48,412 --> 01:26:51,581
Put me down! Put me down!
I can walk on my own.

- Good morning.

876
01:27:01,258 --> 01:27:02,717
Good morning.

We thought if you didn't mind,
we'd drive out to that motel with you.

01:27:05,178 --> 01:27:07,471
- He's already been.
- Went out before service.

879

- Did you two have breakfast?
- You didn't find anything?

880
01:27:10,142 --> 01:27:13,102
Nothing. Let's clear the way here.

881
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:16,314
Well, what did he say about my sister?

882
01:27:16,398 --> 01:27:19,567
Just what he told your detective,
she used a fake name.

883
01:27:19,651 --> 01:27:20,902
Saw the register myself.

884
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:23,905
Saw the whole place, as a matter of fact.
That boy's alone there.

885

- No mother?
- You must have seen an illusion, Sam.

I know you're not the seeing-illusions type,

887
01:27:30,037 --> 01:27:32,538
but no woman was there
and I don't believe in ghosts,

- so there it is.
- I still feel that there's something...

Can see you do.
I'm sorry I couldn't make you feel better.

that's what you want to do.

The sooner you drop this
in the lap of the law,

that's the sooner you stand a chance
of your sister being picked up.

Neither will I. Come on.

inch of the place, inside and out.

- Okay.

01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:29,905
No. That's not necessary.

920
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:34,035
My boss is paying for this trip
and, well, it's 90% business.

921
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:36,871
He wants practically notarised receipts.

922
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:39,582
I'd better sign in and get a receipt.

923
01:29:57,309 --> 01:29:58,684
Thank you.

924
01:30:02,522 --> 01:30:04,982
- I'll get your bags.
- Haven't any.

925
01:30:07,486 --> 01:30:10,654
- I'll show you the room, then.
- SAM: First time I've ever seen it happen.

926
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:12,698
You check in any other place
in this country without bags

927
01:30:12,783 --> 01:30:14,825
and you have to pay in advance.

928
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:16,160
$10.

930
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:25,211
SAM: That receipt.

931
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:32,885
I'll go on ahead.

932
01:30:38,517 --> 01:30:41,602
NORMAN: All right, there's your receipt.
Now, I'll show you the cabin.

933
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:44,396
Don't bother yourself. We'll find it.

934
01:31:02,999 --> 01:31:04,792
Sam, we have to go into that cabin
and search it,

935
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:08,379
no matter what we're afraid of finding
or how much it may hurt.

936
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:09,713
I know.

937
01:31:10,257 --> 01:31:12,007
Do you think if something happened,
it happened there?

938
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:13,592
I don't know.

939
01:31:13,927 --> 01:31:16,428
But if you had a useless
business like this motel,

940
01:31:16,513 --> 01:31:17,680
what would you need to get out?

941
01:31:17,764 --> 01:31:19,807
To get a new business somewhere else?

942
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:21,267
$40,000?

943
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:26,105
How could we prove that...

944
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:28,774
Well, if he opens a motel on
the new highway in, say, a year...

945
01:31:28,859 --> 01:31:31,360
There must be some proof that exists now,

946
01:31:31,444 --> 01:31:34,989
something that proves he got that money
away from Marion somehow.

947
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:39,243
- What makes you sound so certain?
- Arbogast. He liked me, Sam.

948
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:43,247
Or he felt sorry for me and he was
beginning to feel the same way about you.

949
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:46,041
I could tell the last time
I talked to him on the phone.

950
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:47,459
He wouldn't have gone anywhere

951
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:50,254
or done anything without telling us,
unless he was stopped.

952
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:54,175
And he was stopped.
So he must have found out something.

953
01:31:56,386 --> 01:31:58,554
We'll start with Cabin One.

954
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:03,934
If he sees us, we're just taking the air.

955
01:32:35,926 --> 01:32:37,134
SAM: Bates.

956
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:29,812
- No shower curtain.
- Sam!

957
01:33:29,896 --> 01:33:31,021
- Look!
- What is it?

958
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:33,440
It's figuring.
It didn't get washed down. Look.

959
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:37,361
Some figure has been added to
or subtracted from 40,000.

960
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:38,654
That proves Marion was here.

961
01:33:38,738 --> 01:33:42,032
- It'd be too wild a coincidence...
- Bates never denied she was here.

962
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:45,119
Well, doesn't that prove that he found out
about the money?

963
01:33:45,203 --> 01:33:46,912
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?

964
01:33:46,997 --> 01:33:47,997
No.

965
01:33:48,081 --> 01:33:51,583
But that old woman, whoever she is,
she told Arbogast something.

966
01:33:51,668 --> 01:33:54,336
I want her to tell us the same thing.

967
01:33:54,796 --> 01:33:57,464
- You can't go up there.
- Why not?

968
01:33:57,549 --> 01:33:59,466
- Bates.
- Well, let's find him.

969
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:02,261
One of us can keep him occupied
while the other gets to the old woman.

970
01:34:02,345 --> 01:34:05,389
You'll never be able to hold him still
if he doesn't want to be held.

971
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:10,394
- I don't like you going into that house alone.
- I can handle a sick old woman.

972
01:34:10,729 --> 01:34:14,064
All right, I'll find Bates
and keep him occupied.

973
01:34:14,607 --> 01:34:16,150
Wait a minute.

974
01:34:16,735 --> 01:34:19,361
If you get anything out of the mother,

975
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:22,239
can you find your way back to town?

976
01:34:22,324 --> 01:34:23,907
Yes, of course.

977
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:27,870
If you do get anything, don't stop to tell me.

978
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:53,979
- You looking for me?
- Why, yes, as a matter of fact.

979
01:34:54,064 --> 01:34:55,689
Wife's taking a nap

980
01:34:55,774 --> 01:34:59,693
and I never can keep quiet enough for her,
so I just thought I'd look you up and talk.

981
01:34:59,778 --> 01:35:03,155
- Good. You satisfied with your cabin?
- Oh, it's fine.

982
01:36:17,856 --> 01:36:20,441
I've been doing all the talking so far,
haven't I?

983
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:22,609
I thought it was the people
who were alone most of the time

- You are alone here, aren't you?
- Mmm-hmm.

Drive me crazy.

988
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:35,330
I think that would be a rather
extreme reaction, don't you?

989
01:36:35,415 --> 01:36:36,957
Just an expression.

990
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:40,544
What I meant was
I'd do just about anything to get away.

Have I been saying something frightening?

- Do what?

the money to do that, Bates?

- A lot of it. $40,000.

I got it from his mother.

Norman Bates no longer exists.

He only half-existed to begin with.

A psychiatrist doesn't lay the groundwork.

1036
01:42:53,709 --> 01:42:56,044
He merely tries to explain it.

1037

- But my sister is...
- FRED: Yes.

If you drag that swamp somewhere
in the vicinity of the motel, you'll...

1041
01:43:14,772 --> 01:43:17,858
Have you any unsolved missing
persons cases on your books?

1042
01:43:17,942 --> 01:43:20,569
- Yes, two.
- Young girls?

1043
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:24,614
- Did he confess to...
- Like I said, the mother.

1044
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:30,871
Now, to understand it the way I understood
it, hearing it from the mother,

1045
01:43:31,455 --> 01:43:34,708
that is, from the mother half
of Norman's mind,

1046
01:43:35,293 --> 01:43:37,711
you have to go back 10 years

1047
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:41,548
to the time when Norman murdered
his mother and her lover.

1048
01:43:41,632 --> 01:43:46,511
Now, he was already dangerously disturbed,
had been ever since his father died.

1049
01:43:47,555 --> 01:43:51,182
His mother was a clinging,
demanding woman,

1050
01:43:52,685 --> 01:43:57,397
and for years the two of them lived
as if there was no one else in the world.

1051
01:43:57,815 --> 01:43:59,608
Then she met a man,

1052
01:44:00,109 --> 01:44:03,945
and it seemed to Norman
that she threw him over for this man.

1053
01:44:04,697 --> 01:44:08,408
Now, that pushed him over the line
and he killed them both.

1054
01:44:08,993 --> 01:44:12,746
Matricide is probably the most
unbearable crime of all,

1055
01:44:14,206 --> 01:44:17,167
most unbearable to the son who commits it.

1056
01:44:18,169 --> 01:44:22,964
So he had to erase the crime,
at least in his own mind.

1057
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:27,802
He stole her corpse.

1058
01:44:30,348 --> 01:44:32,682
A weighted coffin was buried.

1059
01:44:33,434 --> 01:44:36,019
He hid the body in the fruit cellar,

1060
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:39,356
even treated it to keep it
as well as it would keep.

1061
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:41,650
And that still wasn't enough.

1062
01:44:42,443 --> 01:44:46,071
She was there, but she was a corpse.

1063
01:44:48,616 --> 01:44:51,409
So he began to think and speak for her,

1064
01:44:51,494 --> 01:44:54,037
give her half his life, so to speak.

1065
01:44:54,664 --> 01:44:58,708
At times he could be both personalities,
carry on conversations.

1066
01:44:59,794 --> 01:45:03,296
At other times,
the mother half took over completely.

1067
01:45:03,756 --> 01:45:08,551
He was never all Norman,
but he was often only Mother,

1068
01:45:09,971 --> 01:45:13,348
and because he was
so pathologically jealous of her,

1069
01:45:13,808 --> 01:45:16,267
he assumed that she was as jealous of him.

1070
01:45:16,352 --> 01:45:20,897
Therefore, if he felt a strong
attraction to any other woman,

1071
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:24,651
the mother side of him would go wild.

1072
01:45:27,947 --> 01:45:29,990
When he met your sister,

1073
01:45:31,367 --> 01:45:33,660
he was touched by her, aroused by her.

1074
01:45:33,744 --> 01:45:35,245
He wanted her.

1075
01:45:37,415 --> 01:45:41,543
That set off the jealous mother,
and Mother killed the girl.

1076
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:46,798
After the murder,
Norman returned as if from a deep sleep,

1077
01:45:47,383 --> 01:45:51,302
and, like a dutiful son,
covered up all traces of the crime

1078
01:45:51,387 --> 01:45:54,014
he was convinced
his mother had committed!

1079
01:45:54,098 --> 01:45:56,433
Why was he dressed like that?

1080
01:45:56,892 --> 01:45:58,768
He's a transvestite.

1081
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:01,271
Not exactly.

1082
01:46:01,897 --> 01:46:05,316
A man who dresses in women's clothing
in order to achieve a sexual change

1083
01:46:05,401 --> 01:46:07,861
or satisfaction is a transvestite.

1084
01:46:07,945 --> 01:46:12,449
But in Norman's case,
he was simply doing everything possible

1085
01:46:12,533 --> 01:46:16,036
to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive.

1086
01:46:17,329 --> 01:46:19,873
And when reality came too close,

1087
01:46:19,957 --> 01:46:23,501
when danger or desire
threatened that illusion,

1088
01:46:25,838 --> 01:46:28,965
he'd dress up,
even to a cheap wig he bought.

1089
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:33,178
He'd walk about the house,
sit in her chair, speak in her voice.

1090
01:46:33,262 --> 01:46:35,472
He tried to be his mother.

1091
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:40,060
And now he is.

1092
01:46:41,979 --> 01:46:45,231
That's what I meant when I said
I got the story from the mother.

1093
01:46:45,316 --> 01:46:48,568
You see, when the mind
houses two personalities,

1094
01:46:49,153 --> 01:46:51,821
there's always a conflict, a battle.

1095
01:46:52,782 --> 01:46:55,575
In Norman's case, the battle is over,

1096
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:58,828
and the dominant personality has won.

1097
01:46:58,913 --> 01:47:01,706
And the $40,000? Who got that?

1098
01:47:02,875 --> 01:47:06,544
The swamp.
These were crimes of passion, not profit.

1099
01:47:08,798 --> 01:47:12,509
He feels a little chill.
Can I bring him this blanket?

1100
01:47:12,593 --> 01:47:14,552
- Oh, sure.
- All right.

1101
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:28,316
(NORMAN AS MRS. BATES) Thank you.

1102
01:47:35,950 --> 01:47:39,202
MRS. BATES: It's sad when a mother
<i>has to speak the words</i>

1103
01:47:39,286 --> 01:47:41,287
<i>that condemn her own son,</i>

1104
01:47:41,372 --> 01:47:45,208
<i>but I couldn't allow them to believe</i>
<i>that I would commit murder.</i>

1105
01:47:45,292 --> 01:47:49,129
<i>They'll put him away now,</i>
<i>as I should have years ago.</i>

1106
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,965
<i>He was always bad,</i>

1107
01:47:52,049 --> 01:47:57,095
<i>and in the end he intended to tell them</i>
<i>I killed those girls and that man,</i>

1108
01:47:57,179 --> 01:48:00,890
<i>as if I could do anything</i>
<i>exceptjust sit and stare,</i>

1109
01:48:00,975 --> 01:48:03,393
<i>like one of his stuffed birds.</i>

1110
01:48:04,145 --> 01:48:07,647
<i>They know I can't even move a finger,</i>
<i>and I won't.</i>

1111
01:48:07,731 --> 01:48:13,361
<i>I'll just sit here and be quiet,</i>
<i>just in case they do suspect me.</i>

1112
01:48:16,365 --> 01:48:19,617
<i>They're probably watching me.</i>
<i>Well, let them.</i>

1113
01:48:20,202 --> 01:48:23,037
<i>Let them see what kind of a person I am.</i>

1114
01:48:24,248 --> 01:48:26,666
<i>I'm not even gonna swat that fly.</i>

1115
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:29,502
<i>I hope they are watching. They'll see.</i>

1116
01:48:30,004 --> 01:48:31,671
<i>They'll see and they'll know,</i>

1117
01:48:31,755 --> 01:48:36,259
<i>and they'll say,</i>
<i>"Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly."</i>

1118
01:48:39,221 --> 01:48:41,431
