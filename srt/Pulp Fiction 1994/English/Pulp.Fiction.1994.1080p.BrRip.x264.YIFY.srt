1
00:00:31,061 --> 00:00:35,161
Forget it. It's too risky.
I'm through doing that shit.

2
00:00:35,232 --> 00:00:38,690
You always say that.
The same thing every time.

3
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:40,772
"l'm through, never again,
too dangerous."

4
00:00:40,773 --> 00:00:43,341
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right too.

5
00:00:43,342 --> 00:00:46,812
- You forget about it in a day or two.
- The days of me forgetting are over.

6
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,978
The days of me remembering
have just begun.

7
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:51,216
You know, when you go on like this,
what you sound like?

8
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,243
- I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
- You sound like a duck.

9
00:00:54,244 --> 00:00:57,857
- Quack, quack, quack.
- Take heart, 'cause you're never gonna have to hear it again.

10
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:01,427
Since I'm never gonna do it again,
you're never gonna have to hear me quack.

11
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:06,163
- After tonight?
- Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

12
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,066
- Can I get anyone more coffee?
- Oh, yes!

13
00:01:10,868 --> 00:01:13,430
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

14
00:01:13,504 --> 00:01:16,602
I mean, the way it is now,

15
00:01:16,675 --> 00:01:19,475
you're takin' the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

16
00:01:19,544 --> 00:01:21,605
Takin' more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

17
00:01:21,606 --> 00:01:24,784
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you
in any way during a robbery.

18
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:29,019
They're insured. Why should they give a fuck?
I don't even need a gun in a Federal bank.

19
00:01:29,086 --> 00:01:32,579
Heard about this one bloke, he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.

20
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,659
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says,

21
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,297
"We got this guy's little girl. If you don't
give him all your money, we're gonna kill her."

22
00:01:39,298 --> 00:01:42,168
- Did it work?
- Fuckin' right it worked. That's what I'm talkin' about.

23
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:48,008
Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone.
Not a pistol, not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.

24
00:01:48,072 --> 00:01:52,706
- Cleans the place out. They don't lift a fuckin' finger.
- Did they hurt the little girl?

25
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:56,550
There probably never was a little girl.
The point of the story isn't a little girl.

26
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:59,561
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.

27
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:02,587
- You want to rob banks?
- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

28
00:02:02,588 --> 00:02:05,157
I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be
easier than what we've been doing.

29
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:09,392
- No more liquor stores?
- What've we been talkin' about? Yeah, no more liquor stores.

30
00:02:09,393 --> 00:02:12,429
Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be.
There's too many foreigners own liquor stores.

31
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,430
Vietnamese, Koreans,
don't even speak fuckin' English.

32
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:16,869
You tell 'em empty out the register,
they don't know what you're talkin' about.

33
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,802
They make it too personal.

34
00:02:18,803 --> 00:02:23,175
- We keep on, one of these gook fuckers gonna
make us kill him. - I'm not gonna kill anybody.

35
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:27,477
I don't want to either. But they'll probably
put us in a situation where it's us or them.

36
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:29,478
And if it's not the gooks,

37
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:32,251
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned
the store for 15 fucking generations.

38
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:36,687
You got Grandpa lrving sitting behind the
counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.

39
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:38,758
Try walkin' into one of those places
with nothing but a phone.

40
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,693
See how far that gets you.
Forget it.

41
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,697
- We're out of it.
- Well, what then, day jobs?

42
00:02:43,762 --> 00:02:45,789
- Not in this life.
- What then?

43
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:50,163
Garcon, coffee!

44
00:02:50,235 --> 00:02:52,536
This place.

45
00:02:54,005 --> 00:02:57,102
Garcon means boy.

46
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:03,010
This place?
A coffee shop?

47
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:06,053
What's wrong with that?

48
00:03:06,117 --> 00:03:09,784
Nobody ever robs restaurants.
Why not?

49
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:13,191
Bars, liquor stores,

50
00:03:13,258 --> 00:03:16,993
gas stations; you get your head
blown off stickin' up one of them.

51
00:03:17,062 --> 00:03:20,729
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.

52
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:24,499
They're not expectin' to get robbed.
Not as expectin' anyway.

53
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:29,067
- I bet you could cut down on the hero
factor in a place like this. - Correct.

54
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,408
Same as banks,
these places are insured.

55
00:03:32,477 --> 00:03:34,843
Manager.
He don't give a fuck.

56
00:03:34,844 --> 00:03:37,817
They're just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin' the diners.

57
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:41,779
Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it. No way
they're takin' a bullet for the register.

58
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:44,791
Busboys. Some wetback gettin'
paid $1.50 an hour...

59
00:03:44,856 --> 00:03:47,446
really give a fuck
you're stealin' from the owner?

60
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:50,631
Customers sittin' there with food in their
mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.

61
00:03:50,632 --> 00:03:55,323
One minute, they're havin' a Denver omelet, the
next, someone is stickin' a gun in their face.

62
00:03:55,366 --> 00:04:00,434
See, I got the idea the last
liquor store we stuck up, remember?

63
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:03,204
- All the customers kept comin' in.
- Yeah.

64
00:04:03,274 --> 00:04:07,112
You got the idea of takin' their wallets.
Now, that was a good idea.

65
00:04:07,178 --> 00:04:10,611
- Thank you.
- Made more from the wallets than we did from the register.

66
00:04:10,612 --> 00:04:13,019
- Yes, we did.
- A lot of people come to restaurants.

67
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,684
- A lot of wallets.
- Pretty smart, huh?

68
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,783
Pretty smart.

69
00:04:20,325 --> 00:04:23,354
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.

70
00:04:23,428 --> 00:04:27,927
- Come on.
- All right. Same as last time, remember?

71
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:30,766
You're crowd control.
I'll handle the employees.

72
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,117
- I love you, Pumpkin.
- I love you, Honey Bunny.

73
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,814
Everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!

74
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,760
Any of you fucking pricks move,

75
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,730
and I'll execute
every motherfuckin' last one of you.

76
00:04:49,731 --> 00:04:50,130
And I'll execute
every motherfuckin' last one of you.

77
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:43,474
<i>- Jungle boogie</i>
<i>- Get down with the boogie</i>

78
00:06:43,545 --> 00:06:45,708
<i>- Jungle boogie</i>
<i>- Get it on</i>

79
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,977
<i>- Jungle boogie</i>
<i>- Get down with the boogie</i>

80
00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:50,281
<i>- Jungle boogie</i>
<i>- Get it on</i>

81
00:06:50,351 --> 00:06:52,618
<i>- Jungle boogie</i>
<i>- Get up with the boogie</i>

82
00:06:52,687 --> 00:06:54,748
<i>- Jungle boogie</i>
<i>- Get up with the get down</i>

83
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:57,122
<i>- Jungle boogie</i>
<i>- Get down and boogie</i>

84
00:06:57,191 --> 00:07:00,357
<i>- Jungle boogie</i>
<i>- Shake it around</i>

85
00:07:07,118 --> 00:07:11,217
- Okay, so tell me again about the hash bars.
- Okay, what you want to know?

86
00:07:11,218 --> 00:07:14,193
- Hash is legal there, right?
- It's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.

87
00:07:14,194 --> 00:07:18,825
You just can't walk into a restaurant,
roll a joint and start puffin' away.

88
00:07:18,826 --> 00:07:22,301
I mean, they want you to smoke in
your home or certain designated places.

89
00:07:22,302 --> 00:07:24,965
- Those are hash bars?
- Yeah. It breaks down like this.

90
00:07:25,036 --> 00:07:27,370
It's legal to buy it.
It's legal to own it.

91
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:30,639
And if you're the proprietor
of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.

92
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:35,116
It's illegal to carry it, but-but that
doesn't matter, 'cause get a load of this.

93
00:07:35,179 --> 00:07:39,644
If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam,
it's illegal for them to search you.

94
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:43,658
- I mean, that's a right the cops in
Amsterdam don't have. - Oh, man! I'm goin'.

95
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:46,249
That's all there is to it.
I'm fuckin' goin'.

96
00:07:46,324 --> 00:07:49,259
I know, baby.
You'd dig it the most.

97
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,131
- But you know what the funniest thing
about Europe is? - What?

98
00:07:52,132 --> 00:07:56,136
It's the little differences. I mean, they got
the same shit over there that they got here,

99
00:07:56,137 --> 00:07:59,699
- but it's just there,
it's a little different. - Example.

100
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:02,903
You can walk into a movie theater
in Amsterdam and buy a beer.

101
00:08:02,975 --> 00:08:06,608
And I don't mean just like no paper cup.
I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.

102
00:08:06,678 --> 00:08:10,516
And in Paris, you can buy a beer in
McDonald's. You know what they call...

103
00:08:10,582 --> 00:08:14,074
a Quarter-Pounder
with Cheese in Paris?

104
00:08:14,075 --> 00:08:16,420
They don't call it
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese?

105
00:08:16,421 --> 00:08:19,292
They got the metric system. They wouldn't
know what the fuck a Quarter-Pounder is.

106
00:08:19,293 --> 00:08:23,195
- What do they call it?
- They call it a Royale with Cheese.

107
00:08:23,196 --> 00:08:24,796
- Royale with Cheese.
- That's right.

108
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:26,733
What do they call a Big Mac?

109
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:30,101
Big Mac's a Big Mac,
but they call it Le Big Mac.

110
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:33,300
Le Big Mac.

111
00:08:33,371 --> 00:08:37,539
- What do they call a Whopper?
- I don't know. I didn't go into Burger King.

112
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:41,115
- You know what they put on French fries
in Holland instead of ketchup? - What?

113
00:08:41,116 --> 00:08:44,108
- Mayonnaise.
- Goddamn!

114
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:48,487
- I seen 'em do it, man. They fuckin'
drown 'em in that shit. - Yuck.

115
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:54,458
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.

116
00:08:57,428 --> 00:09:00,195
- How many up there?
- Three or four.

117
00:09:00,265 --> 00:09:03,860
- That's countin' our guy?
- Not sure.

118
00:09:03,861 --> 00:09:07,408
- So that means that it could be
up to five guys up there? - It's possible.

119
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:09,774
We should have fuckin' shotguns.

120
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:12,506
- What's her name?
- Mia.

121
00:09:12,578 --> 00:09:16,780
- Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?
- I don't know.

122
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:20,447
However people meet people.
She used to be a actress.

123
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,012
Oh, really?
She do anything I'd have seen?

124
00:09:23,088 --> 00:09:27,530
- I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.
- Pilot? What's a pilot?

125
00:09:27,593 --> 00:09:31,123
- Well, you know the shows on TV?
- I don't watch TV.

126
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,829
Yeah, but you are aware that there
is an invention called television,

127
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,997
- and on this invention
they show shows, right? - Yeah.

128
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,477
The way they pick TV shows is they make
one show. That show's called a pilot.

129
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:45,476
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...

130
00:09:45,477 --> 00:09:48,550
and on the strength of that one show,
they decide if they wanna make more shows.

131
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:53,080
Some get chosen and become television
programs. Some don't, become nothin'.

132
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,351
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.

133
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:59,188
You remember Antwan Rockamora?

134
00:09:59,258 --> 00:10:03,095
Half-black, half-Samoan.
Used to call him "Tony Rocky Horror."

135
00:10:03,096 --> 00:10:06,634
- Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?
- I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat.

136
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:09,537
I mean, he got a weight problem.
What's a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.

137
00:10:09,538 --> 00:10:13,977
- I think I know who you mean. What about
him? - Marsellus fucked him up good.

138
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:18,275
Word 'round the campfire is it was on
account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.

139
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:30,449
- So what he'd do? Fuck her?
- No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.

140
00:10:30,523 --> 00:10:34,223
- Well, then what then?
- He gave her a foot massage.

141
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:38,728
A foot massage?

142
00:10:38,798 --> 00:10:40,859
- That's it?
- Mm-hmm.

143
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,868
Then what'd Marsellus do?

144
00:10:42,869 --> 00:10:46,174
Sent a couple cats over to his place.
They took him out on his patio.

145
00:10:46,175 --> 00:10:50,111
Threw his ass over the balcony.
Nigger fell four stories.

146
00:10:50,175 --> 00:10:54,240
He had a little garden down at the bottom
enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.

147
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:56,580
Nigger fell through that.

148
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:59,587
Since then, he kind of
developed a speech impediment.

149
00:11:01,053 --> 00:11:03,786
- That's a damn shame.
- Hmm.

150
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:12,297
- But still, you play with matches,
you get burned. - What do you mean?

151
00:11:12,364 --> 00:11:16,533
You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's
new bride a foot massage.

152
00:11:16,603 --> 00:11:19,073
You don't think he overreacted?

153
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:24,011
Antwan didn't expect Marsellus to react the
way he did, but he had to expect a reaction.

154
00:11:24,077 --> 00:11:28,245
It was a foot massage. A foot massage is
nothin'. I give my mother a foot massage.

155
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,844
It's laying your hands in a familiar way
on Marsellus's new wife.

156
00:11:31,918 --> 00:11:36,824
I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy
out? No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark.

157
00:11:36,825 --> 00:11:39,057
Whoa, stop right there.
Eatin' the bitch out...

158
00:11:39,058 --> 00:11:41,730
and givin' the bitch a foot massage
ain't even the same fucking thing.

159
00:11:41,731 --> 00:11:45,668
- It's not. It's the same ballpark.
- Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.

160
00:11:45,732 --> 00:11:48,684
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine.

161
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:52,574
But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking
your tongue in the holiest of holies...

162
00:11:52,575 --> 00:11:56,911
ain't the same fuckin' ballpark; it ain't the
same league; it ain't the same fuckin' sport.

163
00:11:56,912 --> 00:12:00,781
- Foot massages don't mean shit!
- Have you ever given a foot massage?

164
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:03,944
Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.

165
00:12:04,017 --> 00:12:06,730
- I'm the foot fuckin' master.
- You given a lot of them?

166
00:12:06,753 --> 00:12:10,989
Shit, yeah! Got my technique down and
everything. I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.

167
00:12:11,057 --> 00:12:13,722
Would you give a guy
a foot massage?

168
00:12:15,128 --> 00:12:17,827
- Fuck you.

169
00:12:17,897 --> 00:12:20,991
- You give 'em a lot?
- Fuck you.

170
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:24,405
- You know, I'm kind of tired. I could
use a foot massage. - Yo, yo, yo, man.

171
00:12:24,406 --> 00:12:27,605
You best back off.
I'm gettin' a little pissed here.

172
00:12:28,675 --> 00:12:31,237
- This is the door.
- Yeah, it is.

173
00:12:34,013 --> 00:12:36,644
What time you got?

174
00:12:36,716 --> 00:12:38,845
7:22 in the a.m.

175
00:12:38,918 --> 00:12:42,482
No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.

176
00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:53,832
Look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man
a foot massage don't make it right...

177
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:57,171
for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a
building into a glass motherfuckin' house,

178
00:12:57,172 --> 00:12:59,973
fuckin' up the way the nigger talks;
that shit ain't right.

179
00:12:59,974 --> 00:13:04,279
Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better
paralyze my ass, 'cause I kill the motherfucker.

180
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,242
I ain't sayin' it's right, but you sayin' a
massage don't mean nothin'. I'm sayin' it does.

181
00:13:09,315 --> 00:13:14,010
Now, look, I've given a million ladies a million
foot massages, and they all meant somethin'.

182
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,814
We act like they don't, but they do.
That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.

183
00:13:17,824 --> 00:13:19,919
There's a sensuous thing goin' on...

184
00:13:19,992 --> 00:13:23,226
where you don't talk about it,
but you know it and she knows it.

185
00:13:23,296 --> 00:13:28,364
Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan
should've fuckin' better known better.

186
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:32,842
That's his fuckin' wife, man. This ain't a
man with a sense of humor about this shit.

187
00:13:32,905 --> 00:13:35,706
You know what I'm sayin'?

188
00:13:35,776 --> 00:13:37,712
It's an interestin' point.

189
00:13:37,778 --> 00:13:39,714
Come on.
Let's get into character.

190
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:48,657
- What's her name again?
- Mia.

191
00:13:48,722 --> 00:13:51,751
- Mia.
- Why you so interested in big man's wife?

192
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:57,063
He's goin' out of town, Florida. And he asked
me if I'd take care of her while he's gone.

193
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:01,093
- Take care of her?
- No, man. Just take her out.

194
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:04,538
Show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get lonely.

195
00:14:04,605 --> 00:14:07,132
You're gonna be takin'
Mia Wallace out on a date?

196
00:14:07,206 --> 00:14:09,837
It is not a date.

197
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,010
It's just like if you were gonna take
your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.

198
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,611
- It's just good company, that's all.

199
00:14:21,622 --> 00:14:26,390
- It's not a date.
It's definitely not a date. -

200
00:14:32,726 --> 00:14:36,598
Hey, kids.
How you boys doin'?

201
00:14:36,663 --> 00:14:39,327
Hey, keep chillin'.

202
00:14:45,504 --> 00:14:48,305
You know who we are?

203
00:14:48,374 --> 00:14:52,337
We're associates of your
business partner, Marsellus Wallace.

204
00:14:52,411 --> 00:14:55,440
You do remember
your business partner, don't you?

205
00:14:58,151 --> 00:15:01,089
Now, let me take
a wild guess here.

206
00:15:03,123 --> 00:15:06,152
- You're Brett, right?
- Yeah.

207
00:15:06,226 --> 00:15:10,565
I thought so. You remember
your business partner Marsellus Wallace,

208
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,462
don't ya, Brett?

209
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:14,194
Yeah, I remember.

210
00:15:14,267 --> 00:15:18,606
Good. Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.

211
00:15:18,672 --> 00:15:21,302
Sorry about that.
Whatcha havin'?

212
00:15:21,374 --> 00:15:23,344
Hamburgers.

213
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:27,511
Hamburgers! The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast.

214
00:15:28,882 --> 00:15:31,180
What kind of hamburgers?

215
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:33,054
- Uh, ch-cheeseburgers.
- No, no, no.

216
00:15:33,055 --> 00:15:36,225
Where'd you get 'em?
McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box?

217
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:39,024
- Where?
- Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.

218
00:15:39,092 --> 00:15:42,223
Big Kahuna Burger!
That's that Hawaiian burger joint.

219
00:15:42,295 --> 00:15:46,235
I hear they got some tasty burgers.
I ain't never had one myself. How are they?

220
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:48,998
They're-They're good.

221
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:51,700
You mind if I try one of yours?

222
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:54,207
- This is yours here, right?
- Yeah.

223
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:04,316
Mmmm.

224
00:16:04,384 --> 00:16:07,516
This is a tasty burger!
Vincent!

225
00:16:07,588 --> 00:16:10,115
You ever had
a Big Kahuna burger?

226
00:16:11,124 --> 00:16:13,652
Want a bite?
They're real tasty.

227
00:16:13,727 --> 00:16:17,166
- I ain't hungry.
- Well, if you like burgers, give 'em a try sometime.

228
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:21,068
Me, I can't usually get 'em
'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,

229
00:16:21,134 --> 00:16:24,265
which pretty much makes me
a vegetarian.

230
00:16:24,337 --> 00:16:27,503
But I do love the taste
of a good burger. Mmmm.

231
00:16:27,575 --> 00:16:32,107
You know what they call
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese in France?

232
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:34,240
- No.
- Tell 'em, Vincent.

233
00:16:34,314 --> 00:16:38,345
- A Royale with Cheese.
- A Royale with Cheese.

234
00:16:38,418 --> 00:16:41,880
You know why they call it that?

235
00:16:41,955 --> 00:16:45,018
Uh, because of
the metric system?

236
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:49,394
Check out the big brain
on Brett!

237
00:16:49,462 --> 00:16:52,799
You're a smart motherfucker.
That's right. The metric system.

238
00:16:55,135 --> 00:16:57,264
- What's in this?
- Sprite.

239
00:16:57,337 --> 00:16:59,273
Sprite. Good.

240
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:03,211
You mind if I have some of your
tasty beverage to wash this down with?

241
00:17:03,276 --> 00:17:06,146
Go right ahead.

242
00:17:17,592 --> 00:17:20,427
That hit the spot.

243
00:17:20,493 --> 00:17:24,555
You. Flock of Seagulls.
You know why we're here?

244
00:17:24,556 --> 00:17:28,238
- Why don't you tell my man Vince here
where you got the shit hid. - It's over-

245
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:31,834
I don't remember askin' you
a goddamned thing!

246
00:17:35,543 --> 00:17:37,341
You were sayin'?

247
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,471
It's in the cupboard.

248
00:17:42,249 --> 00:17:45,221
N-No, the one
by your kn-knees.

249
00:18:06,107 --> 00:18:08,407
We happy?

250
00:18:08,475 --> 00:18:11,345
Vincent?

251
00:18:11,411 --> 00:18:14,110
- We happy?
- Yeah, we happy.

252
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:20,487
Look, I'm sorry, uh, l-
I didn't get your name.

253
00:18:20,554 --> 00:18:23,754
I got yours. Vincent. Right?
B-But I never got yours.

254
00:18:23,824 --> 00:18:29,165
- My name's Pitt, and your ass ain't talkin'
your way outta this shit. - No, no, no.

255
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:33,569
I just want you
to know how-

256
00:18:36,203 --> 00:18:39,699
I just want you to know how sorry we are
th-that things got so fucked up...

257
00:18:39,774 --> 00:18:41,971
with us and Mr. Wallace.

258
00:18:42,043 --> 00:18:46,542
W-We got into this thing with
the best intentions. Really. I never-

259
00:18:46,614 --> 00:18:50,018
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I break your concentration?

260
00:18:50,084 --> 00:18:52,681
- I didn't mean to do that. Please.

261
00:18:52,753 --> 00:18:57,923
Continue. You were saying something
about "best intentions."

262
00:18:59,327 --> 00:19:03,233
What's the matter?
Oh, you were finished!

263
00:19:03,297 --> 00:19:06,030
Oh, well, allow me to retort.

264
00:19:09,571 --> 00:19:12,566
What does Marsellus Wallace
look like?

265
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:14,838
What?

266
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:18,177
- What country you from?
- What?

267
00:19:18,245 --> 00:19:22,516
- "What" ain't no country I ever heard of.
They speak English in What? 
- W-What? 

268
00:19:22,584 --> 00:19:25,281
- English, motherfucker! 
Do you speak it? 
- Yes!

269
00:19:25,282 --> 00:19:27,122
- Then you know what I'm sayin'!
- Yes.

270
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:30,561
Describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!

271
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,255
- What? l-
- Say "what" again!

272
00:19:33,327 --> 00:19:37,267
Say "what" again! I dare ya!
I double dare you, motherfucker!

273
00:19:37,331 --> 00:19:41,237
- Say "what" one more goddamn time!
- H-H-He's black.

274
00:19:41,302 --> 00:19:43,637
- Go on!
- He's bald!

275
00:19:43,705 --> 00:19:46,437
- Does he look like a bitch?
- What?

276
00:19:48,175 --> 00:19:52,206
Does he look... Iike a bitch?

277
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:55,514
- No!
- Then why you tryin' to fuck him like a bitch?

278
00:19:55,584 --> 00:19:59,216
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett!

279
00:19:59,286 --> 00:20:01,449
- You tried to fuck him.
-  No, no.

280
00:20:01,523 --> 00:20:06,795
But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be
fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

281
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:09,925
- You read the Bible, Brett?
- Yes!

282
00:20:09,997 --> 00:20:14,564
Well, there's this passage I got memorized.
Sort of fits this occasion.

283
00:20:14,636 --> 00:20:16,970
Ezekiel 25:17.

284
00:20:17,037 --> 00:20:20,339
<i>"The path of the righteous man...</i>

285
00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:24,348
<i>is beset on all sides</i>
<i>by the inequities of the selfish...</i>

286
00:20:24,412 --> 00:20:27,350
<i>and the tyranny of evil men.</i>

287
00:20:27,415 --> 00:20:32,357
<i>Blessed is he who,</i>
<i>in the name of charity and goodwill,</i>

288
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,587
<i>shepherds the weak</i>
<i>through the valley of darkness,</i>

289
00:20:35,657 --> 00:20:38,321
<i>for he is truly</i>
<i>his brother's keeper...</i>

290
00:20:38,392 --> 00:20:41,957
<i>and the finder of lost children.</i>

291
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,834
<i>And I will strike down upon thee</i>
<i>with great vengeance...</i>

292
00:20:45,901 --> 00:20:47,871
<i>and furious anger...</i>

293
00:20:47,936 --> 00:20:52,605
<i>those who attempt to poison</i>
<i>and destroy My brothers!</i>

294
00:20:52,674 --> 00:20:56,512
<i>And you will know</i>
<i>My name is the Lord...</i>

295
00:20:56,578 --> 00:20:59,982
<i>when I lay My vengeance</i>
<i>upon thee!"</i>

296
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,865
I think you gonna find...

297
00:21:20,936 --> 00:21:23,601
when all this shit
is over and done-

298
00:21:25,273 --> 00:21:29,647
I think you're gonna find yourself
one smilin' motherfucker.

299
00:21:31,213 --> 00:21:34,014
The thing is, Butch,

300
00:21:34,082 --> 00:21:37,111
right now...
you got ability.

301
00:21:38,787 --> 00:21:41,223
But painful as it may be,

302
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:44,455
ability... don't last.

303
00:21:46,428 --> 00:21:50,529
And your days are just about over.

304
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:55,006
Now, that's a hard
motherfuckin' fact of life.

305
00:21:55,070 --> 00:22:00,103
But that's a fact of life your ass
is gonna have to get realistic about.

306
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:07,476
You see, this business is filled to
the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.

307
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:11,513
Motherfuckers who thought
their ass would age like wine.

308
00:22:13,221 --> 00:22:16,956
If you mean it turns
to vinegar... it does.

309
00:22:18,193 --> 00:22:22,463
If you mean it gets better
with age... it don't.

310
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:26,102
Besides, Butch,

311
00:22:27,836 --> 00:22:31,468
how many fights you think
you got in you anyway?

312
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,738
Hmm?

313
00:22:33,808 --> 00:22:35,778
Two?

314
00:22:36,878 --> 00:22:40,282
Boxers don't have
an old-timers' day.

315
00:22:41,383 --> 00:22:45,380
You came close,
but you never made it.

316
00:22:45,453 --> 00:22:49,656
And if you were gonna make it,
you would have made it before now.

317
00:23:06,374 --> 00:23:08,641
You my nigger?

318
00:23:13,315 --> 00:23:15,718
Certainly appears so.

319
00:23:22,157 --> 00:23:26,097
The night of the fight,
you may feel a slight sting.

320
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:32,601
That's pride fuckin' with you.

321
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:36,265
Fuck pride!

322
00:23:38,007 --> 00:23:41,036
Pride only hurts.

323
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,046
It never helps.

324
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:46,506
You fight through that shit.

325
00:23:48,017 --> 00:23:52,925
'Cause a year from now,
when you kickin' it in the Caribbean,

326
00:23:52,989 --> 00:23:57,938
you gonna say to yourself,
"Marsellus Wallace was right."

327
00:23:59,902 --> 00:24:04,172
I got no problem
with that, Mr. Wallace.

328
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:08,043
In the fifth,
your ass goes down.

329
00:24:12,114 --> 00:24:14,050
Say it.

330
00:24:16,318 --> 00:24:19,758
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

331
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,217
Yo, Vincent Vega.
Our man in Amsterdam.

332
00:24:24,293 --> 00:24:28,758
Jules Winfield, our man in lnglewood.
Get your asses on in here.

333
00:24:28,831 --> 00:24:32,685
- Goddamn, nigger, what's up with them
clothes? - You don't even want to know.

334
00:24:32,735 --> 00:24:36,000
Where's the big man?

335
00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:39,075
The big man's right over there
takin' care of some business.

336
00:24:39,076 --> 00:24:43,539
Why don't you hang back a second or two.
You see the white boy leave, go on over.

337
00:24:46,248 --> 00:24:48,515
How ya been?

338
00:24:48,584 --> 00:24:52,524
- I been doin' pretty good.
How 'bout yourself? - All right.

339
00:24:54,123 --> 00:24:56,993
So I hear you're
takin' Mia out tomorrow.

340
00:25:00,129 --> 00:25:02,326
At Marsellus's request.

341
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:06,161
- Have you met Mia?
- Not yet.

342
00:25:06,235 --> 00:25:09,435
- What's so fuckin' funny?

343
00:25:09,505 --> 00:25:12,102
- Not a goddamn thing.
- I got to piss.

344
00:25:12,174 --> 00:25:16,443
Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot,
all right? It's the big man's wife.

345
00:25:16,444 --> 00:25:19,249
I'm gonna sit across from her,
chew my food with my mouth closed,

346
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,284
Iaugh at her fuckin' jokes,
and that's it.

347
00:25:21,285 --> 00:25:24,414
Hey, my name's Paul,
and this shit's between y'all.

348
00:25:24,486 --> 00:25:27,550
Then what'd you fuckin'
ask me about it for?

349
00:25:27,624 --> 00:25:30,117
Asshole.

350
00:25:36,365 --> 00:25:38,563
- Gimme a pack of Red Apples.
- Filters?

351
00:25:38,635 --> 00:25:40,571
No.

352
00:25:43,405 --> 00:25:47,311
- You lookin' at somethin', friend?
- You ain't my friend, palooka.

353
00:25:49,411 --> 00:25:52,907
- What was that?
- I think you heard me just fine, punchy.

354
00:25:52,981 --> 00:25:55,578
Vincent Vega's in the house?

355
00:25:55,652 --> 00:25:58,954
My nigger,
get your ass over here.

356
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:09,329
- What's up?
- Man, I'm really sorry.

357
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:11,562
You shouldn't worry about it.

358
00:26:11,634 --> 00:26:14,606
Pack of Red Apples. $1.40.

359
00:26:17,106 --> 00:26:19,440
And some matches.

360
00:26:22,545 --> 00:26:24,480
Thanks.

361
00:26:26,348 --> 00:26:30,687
It's as if it turns every part
of your body into the tip of a penis.

362
00:26:30,754 --> 00:26:34,660
- Whoa.
- I'll lend it to you. It's a great book on piercing.

363
00:26:34,724 --> 00:26:39,131
That gun to pierce your ears, they don't
use that to pierce your nipples, do they?

364
00:26:39,194 --> 00:26:43,066
Forget that gun. That guns goes against
the entire idea behind piercing.

365
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:48,007
All my piercing, 18 places on my body,
every one of 'em done with a needle.

366
00:26:48,071 --> 00:26:51,567
Five in each ear, one through
the nipple of my left breast,

367
00:26:51,641 --> 00:26:54,772
two in my right nostril,
one in my left eyebrow,

368
00:26:54,844 --> 00:26:57,714
one in my belly,
one in my lip, one in my clit,

369
00:26:57,781 --> 00:27:01,242
- and I wear a stud in my tongue.
- Excuse me.

370
00:27:01,316 --> 00:27:03,252
I was just curious,

371
00:27:03,318 --> 00:27:07,190
but, um... why would you wear
a stud in your tongue?

372
00:27:07,257 --> 00:27:10,753
Sex thing.
Helps fellatio.

373
00:27:10,827 --> 00:27:14,790
Vincenzo.
Step in my office.

374
00:27:21,571 --> 00:27:24,634
This is Panda from Mexico.
Very good stuff.

375
00:27:24,707 --> 00:27:28,146
Now, that's Bava.
Different, but equally good.

376
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:31,149
And that is Choco
from the Harz Mountains of Germany.

377
00:27:31,214 --> 00:27:35,656
Now, the first two are the same.
300 a gram. Those are friend prices.

378
00:27:35,718 --> 00:27:38,690
But this one
is a little more expensive.

379
00:27:38,755 --> 00:27:41,157
This is 500 a gram.

380
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:44,629
But, when you shoot it, you will know
where that extra money went.

381
00:27:44,694 --> 00:27:48,794
There's nothing wrong with these two.
This is real, real, real good shit.

382
00:27:48,865 --> 00:27:52,532
But this one
is a fuckin' madman.

383
00:27:52,602 --> 00:27:55,368
Remember, I just got back
from Amsterdam.

384
00:27:55,438 --> 00:27:58,467
Am I a nigger?
Are we in lnglewood? No.

385
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:01,707
You're in my home. Now, white people
who know the difference...

386
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:04,849
between good shit and bad shit,
this is the house they come to.

387
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,285
Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi
Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...

388
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:11,587
- any old day of the fuckin' week.
- That's a bold statement.

389
00:28:11,654 --> 00:28:15,526
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.
This is a seller's market.

390
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:19,590
Coke is fuckin' dead
as... dead.

391
00:28:19,663 --> 00:28:23,535
Heroin, it's comin' back
in a big fuckin' way.

392
00:28:24,801 --> 00:28:28,259
- All right.
Gimme three grams of madman. - Okay.

393
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,843
Now, if it's as good as you say it is,
I'll come back and buy another thousand.

394
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:34,608
I just hope that I still
have some left for ya,

395
00:28:34,678 --> 00:28:38,880
but I'm givin' you some
out of my own private stash.

396
00:28:38,948 --> 00:28:42,114
That is what a nice guy I am.

397
00:28:42,185 --> 00:28:46,285
- I'm outta balloons.
Is a baggie all right? - Yeah, that's cool.

398
00:28:46,356 --> 00:28:48,349
All right.
I'll just get one for ya.

399
00:28:48,424 --> 00:28:53,366
Honey, will you get me some baggies
and, uh, twistix from the kitchen?

400
00:28:53,429 --> 00:28:55,399
Okay.

401
00:28:55,465 --> 00:28:58,996
Hey, uh, what do you think about Trudi?
She ain't got a boyfriend.

402
00:28:59,068 --> 00:29:02,370
- You wanna hang out and get high?
- Which one's Trudi?

403
00:29:02,438 --> 00:29:06,607
- The one with all the shit in her face?
- No, that's Jody.

404
00:29:06,677 --> 00:29:09,113
That's my wife.

405
00:29:09,178 --> 00:29:13,779
-  I'm sorry, man.
- Thank you.

406
00:29:13,851 --> 00:29:17,723
- No, I can't. I gotta be someplace.
- All right, no problemo.

407
00:29:17,788 --> 00:29:20,521
- I'll take a rain check.

408
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:23,927
- Oh.
- Thank you, Jody.

409
00:29:23,994 --> 00:29:27,296
Still got your Malibu?

410
00:29:27,363 --> 00:29:30,460
Oh, man, you know what some fucker
did the other day?

411
00:29:30,534 --> 00:29:32,469
- What?
- Fuckin' keyed it.

412
00:29:32,536 --> 00:29:36,134
- Oh, man, that's fucked up.
- Tell me about it.

413
00:29:36,205 --> 00:29:38,904
I had it in storage
for three years.

414
00:29:38,976 --> 00:29:43,314
It was out five days, and some
dickless piece of shit fucked with it.

415
00:29:43,379 --> 00:29:47,821
They should be fuckin' killed, man. No
trial, no jury, straight to execution.

416
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:52,623
I wish I could've caught him doin' it. I'd
have given anything to catch that asshole.

417
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:57,425
- It'd been worth him doin' it just so I
could've caught him. - What a fucker!

418
00:29:57,426 --> 00:30:00,364
What's more chicken-shit
than fuckin' with a man's automobile?

419
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:03,267
- Don't fuck with another man's vehicle.
- You don't do it.

420
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,736
- It's just against the rules.
- Thank you.

421
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:07,966
Thank you.

422
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:10,839
- Mind if I shoot up here?
- Hey, mi casa es su casa.

423
00:30:10,908 --> 00:30:14,210
Muchas gracias.

424
00:31:57,145 --> 00:32:01,245
Hi, Vincent.
I'm getting dressed. The door's open.

425
00:32:01,316 --> 00:32:05,519
Come inside and make yourself
a drink. Mia.

426
00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:16,399
Hello?

427
00:32:16,465 --> 00:32:20,964
Billy Raye was a preacher's son and when
his daddy would visit he'd come along

428
00:32:21,036 --> 00:32:23,165
Vincent.

429
00:32:25,407 --> 00:32:27,742
Vincent.

430
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,746
I'm on the intercom.

431
00:32:29,812 --> 00:32:32,442
Where is-
Where is the intercom?

432
00:32:32,515 --> 00:32:35,851
It's on the wall
by the two African fellows.

433
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,014
To your right.

434
00:32:41,156 --> 00:32:43,251
Warm.

435
00:32:43,325 --> 00:32:45,420
Warmer.

436
00:32:45,494 --> 00:32:47,487
Disco.

437
00:32:47,563 --> 00:32:50,159
Hello?

438
00:32:50,232 --> 00:32:53,569
Push the button
if you want to talk.

439
00:32:53,636 --> 00:32:55,697
Hello?

440
00:32:55,772 --> 00:32:59,610
Go make yourself a drink, and I'll
be down in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

441
00:32:59,676 --> 00:33:03,080
The bar's by the fireplace.

442
00:33:04,948 --> 00:33:07,009
Okay.

443
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:09,520
<i>When he started</i>
<i>sweet talkin' to me</i>

444
00:33:09,585 --> 00:33:12,351
<i>He come and tell me</i>
<i>everything is all right</i>

445
00:33:12,421 --> 00:33:15,086
<i>He'd kiss me and tell me</i>
<i>everything is all right</i>

446
00:33:15,158 --> 00:33:17,094
<i>Can I get away again tonight</i>

447
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,757
<i>The only one who could</i>
<i>ever reach me</i>

448
00:33:19,829 --> 00:33:22,459
<i>Was the son of a preacher man</i>

449
00:33:22,532 --> 00:33:25,595
<i>The only boy</i>
<i>who could ever teach me</i>

450
00:33:25,668 --> 00:33:28,640
<i>Was the son of a preacher man</i>
<i>Yes, he was</i>

451
00:33:28,705 --> 00:33:31,005
<i>He was</i>

452
00:33:31,074 --> 00:33:33,705
<i>Lord he knows he was</i>
<i>Yes he was</i>

453
00:33:36,346 --> 00:33:38,783
<i>How will I remember</i>

454
00:33:38,848 --> 00:33:41,581
<i>The look was in his eyes</i>

455
00:33:41,651 --> 00:33:44,144
<i>Stealing kisses from me</i>
<i>on the sly</i>

456
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,817
<i>Taking time to make time</i>

457
00:33:46,889 --> 00:33:49,382
<i>Telling me that he's all mine</i>

458
00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:52,397
<i>Learning from each other's knowin'</i>

459
00:33:52,462 --> 00:33:54,558
<i>Looking to see</i>
<i>how much we've grown</i>

460
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,100
<i>And the only one</i>
<i>who could ever reach me</i>

461
00:33:57,166 --> 00:33:59,432
<i>Was the son of a preacher man</i>

462
00:33:59,502 --> 00:34:02,474
<i>The only boy</i>
<i>who could ever teach me</i>

463
00:34:02,538 --> 00:34:04,906
<i>Was the son of a preacher man</i>
<i>Yes, he was</i>

464
00:34:04,974 --> 00:34:07,775
<i>- Was, was</i>
<i>- He was</i>

465
00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:10,543
<i>- Oh, yes he was</i>

466
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:12,445
Let's go.

467
00:34:18,087 --> 00:34:20,057
What the fuck is this place?

468
00:34:20,123 --> 00:34:23,619
This is Jackrabbit Slim's.

469
00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:26,027
- An Elvis man should love it.

470
00:34:26,095 --> 00:34:30,297
- Come on, Mia. Let's go get a steak.
- You can get a steak here, daddy-o.

471
00:34:30,366 --> 00:34:33,167
Don't be a-

472
00:34:33,236 --> 00:34:36,676
Oh, after you, kitty-cat.

473
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:59,895
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Now, how may I help you?

474
00:34:59,962 --> 00:35:02,798
- There's a reservation under Wallace.
- Wallace?

475
00:35:02,865 --> 00:35:05,769
- We reserved a car.

476
00:35:05,836 --> 00:35:11,370
Oh, a car. Why don't you seat 'em
over there in the Chrysler.

477
00:35:11,441 --> 00:35:14,812
<i>School get out, baby</i>
<i>Gonna tell you some news</i>

All right

482
00:35:35,364 --> 00:35:37,631
I've been waitin' in school
all day long

483
00:35:37,701 --> 00:35:39,813
Waiting on the bell to ring
so I can go home

484
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,362
Throw my books on the table
Pick up the telephone

485
00:35:42,363 --> 00:35:44,607
<i>- Come on, baby</i>
- Coffee, please? Decaf.

486
00:35:44,608 --> 00:35:46,978
- Just a minute.
<i>- Heading down to the drugstore to get a soda pop</i>

487
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:49,413
<i>Throw a nickel in the jukebox</i>
<i>Then we start to rock</i>

<i>Just wait and see</i>

494
00:36:10,634 --> 00:36:14,364
Ricky, Ricky, Ricky!

495
00:36:14,365 --> 00:36:19,142
Let's hear it for Ricky Nelson!

496
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:22,548
- Fantastic job, Rick.
Thank you very much. - Vincent!

497
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:29,886
Just to let you all know, Ricky
will be back in the second half of our show,

498
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:34,453
so we hope you enjoy your meals
here at Jackrabbit Slim's.

499
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,893
Thank you.

500
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,421
Call for...

501
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:45,097
- Phil-lip Mor-ris.
- What do you think?

502
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:49,873
I think it's like
a wax museum with a pulse.

503
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,778
Hi, I'm Buddy.
What can I get you?

504
00:36:56,313 --> 00:37:00,652
Let's see, steak, steak, steak. Oh,
yeah, I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

505
00:37:00,717 --> 00:37:03,518
- I'll have that.
- How do you want that cooked?

506
00:37:03,587 --> 00:37:06,889
- Burned to a crisp or bloody as hell?
- Bloody as hell, and-

507
00:37:06,957 --> 00:37:09,690
Oh, yeah, look at this-
vanilla Coke.

508
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,730
What about you, Peggy Sue?

509
00:37:11,795 --> 00:37:15,131
I'll have the...

510
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:19,538
Durward Kirby burger, bloody.

511
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:23,505
And... a five-dollar shake.

512
00:37:23,506 --> 00:37:26,377
How do you want that shake,
Martin and Lewis, or Amos 'n Andy?

513
00:37:26,378 --> 00:37:30,511
- Martin and Lewis.
- Did you just order a five-dollar shake?

514
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,643
Mm-hmm.

515
00:37:32,716 --> 00:37:35,882
That's a shake?
That's milk and ice cream?

516
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:40,360
- Last I heard.
- That's five dollars? You don't put bourbon in it or nothin'?

517
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,793
- No.
- Just checking.

518
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:45,558
I'll be right back
with your drinks.

519
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,566
To Lonesome Town

520
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:51,595
To cry my troubles away

521
00:37:53,203 --> 00:37:57,268
Could you, um...
roll me one of those, cowboy?

522
00:37:57,341 --> 00:38:00,211
You can have this one, cowgirl.

523
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:02,213
- Thanks.

524
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:04,682
The streets are filled
with regret

525
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,977
Think nothin' of it.

526
00:38:09,052 --> 00:38:12,890
Lay me down in Lonesome Town

527
00:38:12,956 --> 00:38:16,486
- I can learn to forget
- So...

528
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:19,658
Marsellus said
you just got back from Amsterdam.

529
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,862
- Sure did.
- How long were you there?

530
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:25,461
Just over three years.

531
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,841
I go there about once a year
to chill out for a month.

532
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:34,643
No kiddin'?
I didn't know that.

533
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:37,650
Why would you?

534
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:44,255
I heard you did a pilot.

535
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:49,223
- That was my 15 minutes.
- What was it?

536
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:53,997
It was a show about a team of female
secret agents called Fox Force Five.

537
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,798
- What?
- Fox Force Five.

538
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:59,134
Fox, as in were a bunch
of foxy chicks.

539
00:38:59,202 --> 00:39:01,673
Force, as in we're a force
to be reckoned with.

540
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:04,572
And five, as in there's
one-two-three-four-five of us.

541
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:08,275
There was a blond one,
Sommerset O'Neal. She was the leader.

542
00:39:08,345 --> 00:39:11,476
The Japanese fox
was a kung fu master.

543
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:15,614
The black girl
was a demolition expert.

544
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,557
French fox's speciality was sex.

545
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:22,996
- What was your speciality?
- Knives.

546
00:39:23,126 --> 00:39:25,096
The character I played,
Raven McCoy,

547
00:39:25,161 --> 00:39:29,033
her background was she grew up
raised by circus performers.

548
00:39:29,098 --> 00:39:33,368
According to the show, she was the
deadliest woman in the world with a knife.

549
00:39:33,435 --> 00:39:36,202
And she knew
a zillion old jokes.

550
00:39:36,272 --> 00:39:40,401
Her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her.

551
00:39:40,402 --> 00:39:43,848
And if we would have got picked up,
they would've worked in a gimmick...

552
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:47,718
where every show
I would've told another joke.

553
00:39:48,918 --> 00:39:51,685
You know any of them old jokes?

554
00:39:51,754 --> 00:39:55,488
Well, I only got the chance to say one
'cause we only did one show.

555
00:39:55,558 --> 00:39:58,120
- Tell me.
- It's corny.

556
00:39:59,028 --> 00:40:01,123
Don't be that way.
Tell me.

557
00:40:01,197 --> 00:40:04,898
- No, you wouldn't like it,
and I'd be embarrassed. - You'd be embarr-

558
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:08,907
You told 50 million people,
and you can't tell me?

559
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:12,843
- I promise I won't laugh.
- That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.

560
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:15,243
That's not what I meant.
You know it.

561
00:40:15,244 --> 00:40:18,818
Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you
'cause it's been built up too much.

562
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:21,411
What a gyp.

563
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,954
Martin and Lewis.

564
00:40:28,024 --> 00:40:30,426
Vanilla Coke.

565
00:40:34,764 --> 00:40:38,100
Mmm. Yummy.

566
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:41,139
You think I could
have a sip of that?

567
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,836
Be my guest.

568
00:40:44,907 --> 00:40:48,938
I gotta know what
a five-dollar shake tastes like.

569
00:40:49,011 --> 00:40:52,472
- You can use my straw. I don't have
cooties. 
- Yeah, but maybe I do. 

570
00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:55,418
Cooties I can handle.

571
00:40:55,485 --> 00:40:57,455
All right.

572
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:07,328
Goddamn, that's a pretty
fuckin' good milkshake!

573
00:41:07,396 --> 00:41:11,461
- Told ya.
- I don't know if it was worth $5, but it's pretty fuckin' good.

574
00:41:46,402 --> 00:41:49,933
- Don't you hate that?
- Hate what?

575
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,341
Uncomfortable silences.

576
00:41:54,343 --> 00:41:58,876
Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about
bullshit in order to be comfortable?

577
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:02,889
I don't know.
That's a good question.

578
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:07,691
That's when you know
you found somebody really special.

579
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:12,461
When you can just shut the fuck up for
a minute and comfortably share silence.

580
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:16,683
Well, I don't think we're quite there yet,
but don't feel bad. We just met each other.

581
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:21,266
I'll tell you what.

582
00:42:21,337 --> 00:42:24,606
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and powder my nose.

583
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:27,875
You sit here...
and think of something to say.

584
00:42:29,112 --> 00:42:31,048
I'll do that.

585
00:42:33,382 --> 00:42:35,318
Okay.

586
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:02,774
I said goddamn!

587
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:06,012
Goddamn!
Goddamn.

588
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:11,215
I need some hair spray.

589
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,051
Mmmm.

590
00:43:19,052 --> 00:43:23,536
Don't you just love it when you come back from
the bathroom to find your food waiting for you?

591
00:43:23,537 --> 00:43:25,936
We're lucky
we got anything at all.

592
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:29,134
I don't think Buddy Holly's
much of a waiter.

593
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:32,337
Maybe we should've sat
in Marilyn Monroe's section.

594
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:35,472
- Which one? There's two Monroes.
- No, there's not.

595
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:37,880
That is Marilyn Monroe.

596
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,681
That is Mamie Van Doren.

597
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:45,693
I don't see Jayne Mansfield,
so she must have the night off.

598
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:49,195
- Pretty smart.
- Yeah. I got my moments.

599
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:53,633
- So did you think of somethin' to say?
- Actually, I did.

600
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:57,235
However...

601
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:01,965
you seem like
a really nice person, and l-

602
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:04,875
- I don't want to offend you.
- Oooh.

603
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:10,146
This doesn't sound like the usual, mindless,
boring, gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.

604
00:44:10,213 --> 00:44:13,208
This sounds like you
actually have somethin' to say.

605
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:16,119
Well, well, I do. I do.

606
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:20,251
-  But you have
to promise not to be offended. - No, no.

607
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:24,561
You can't promise somethin' like that.
I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.

608
00:44:24,629 --> 00:44:29,497
You can ask me what you're gonna ask me, and
my natural response could be to get offended.

609
00:44:29,498 --> 00:44:32,004
Then, through no fault of my own,
I would have broken my promise.

610
00:44:32,005 --> 00:44:34,701
- Let's just forget it.
- That's an impossibility.

611
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:38,866
Trying to forget anything as intriguing
as this would be an exercise in futility.

612
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,107
- Is that a fact?
- And besides,

613
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:46,211
- isn't it more, uh, exciting when you don't
have permission? - All right, all right.

614
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:49,084
Well, here goes.

615
00:44:49,152 --> 00:44:52,181
What did you think about
what happened to Antwan?

616
00:44:52,255 --> 00:44:55,695
- Who's Antwan?
- Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.

617
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,994
- He fell out of a window.
- Hmm. Hmm.

618
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:03,767
Well, that is one way to say it. Another way
to say it would be that he was thrown out.

619
00:45:03,835 --> 00:45:07,001
Another way would be
he was thrown out by Marsellus.

620
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:12,207
Yet even another way is to say he was thrown
out of a window by Marsellus because of you.

621
00:45:12,275 --> 00:45:14,710
- Is that a fact?
- No.

622
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:17,984
No, it's not a fact. It's just what
I heard. That's just what I heard.

623
00:45:17,985 --> 00:45:20,886
- Who told you?
- They.

624
00:45:20,952 --> 00:45:23,422
"They" talk a lot, don't they?

625
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:28,254
They certainly do.
They certainly do.

626
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:32,733
- Don't be shy, Vincent. What else
did "they" say? - I'm-I'm not shy.

627
00:45:32,797 --> 00:45:35,324
- Um-
- Did it involve the "F" word?

628
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:39,396
No, no, no, no, no. They just said
that Antwan had given you a foot massage.

629
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:43,569
- And?
- And-And nothin'.

630
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:46,511
That's it.

631
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,638
You heard Marsellus...

632
00:45:48,713 --> 00:45:53,086
threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a fourth-
story window for giving me a foot massage?

633
00:45:53,151 --> 00:45:55,087
- Mm-hmm.
- And you believe that?

634
00:45:55,153 --> 00:45:59,686
Well, at the time
I was told it sounded reasonable.

635
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,854
Marsellus throwing Tony out
of a fourth-story window...

636
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,990
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?

637
00:46:06,064 --> 00:46:09,525
No, it seemed excessive,
but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

638
00:46:09,526 --> 00:46:12,337
I understand that Marsellus
is very protective of you.

639
00:46:12,338 --> 00:46:16,966
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

640
00:46:16,967 --> 00:46:20,848
A husband almost killing another man for
touching his wife's feet is something else.

641
00:46:20,849 --> 00:46:23,441
But did it happen?

642
00:46:23,515 --> 00:46:29,356
Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was
my hand when he shook it... at my wedding.

643
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,823
Really?

644
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:35,225
Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus
threw Tony out that window...

645
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:37,229
except Marsellus and Tony.

646
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:41,292
When you little scamps get together,
you're worse than a sewing circle.

647
00:46:41,432 --> 00:46:45,304
Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

648
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:50,402
The world-famous
Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.

649
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:57,148
Now, this is where
one lucky couple...

650
00:46:57,215 --> 00:47:01,680
will win this handsome trophy
that Marilyn here is holding.

651
00:47:01,753 --> 00:47:05,317
Now, who will be
our first contestants?

652
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:07,656
- Right here!
-  All right!

653
00:47:07,726 --> 00:47:10,755
- I wanna dance.
- No, no, no, no, no.

654
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:15,567
No, no, no, no, no. I do believe
Marsellus, my husband, your boss,

655
00:47:15,634 --> 00:47:19,073
told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.

656
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:22,835
Now I wanna dance;
I wanna win; I want that trophy.

657
00:47:22,836 --> 00:47:24,115
- So dance good.
- All right. You asked for it.

658
00:47:24,116 --> 00:47:25,518
- So dance good.
- All right. You asked for it.

659
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:28,490
Let's hear it
for our first contestants.

660
00:47:33,092 --> 00:47:38,364
Now let's meet our first contestants here
this evening. Young lady, what is your name?

661
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:40,423
Mrs. Mia Wallace.

662
00:47:40,499 --> 00:47:43,130
And how 'bout your fella here?

663
00:47:43,202 --> 00:47:45,035
Vincent Vega.

664
00:47:45,104 --> 00:47:48,544
All right, let's see what you can do.
Take it away!

665
00:47:48,608 --> 00:47:51,546
-  Go for it.
-  Come on!

666
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:13,793
It was a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well

667
00:48:15,802 --> 00:48:19,765
You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle

668
00:48:21,842 --> 00:48:25,942
And now the young monsieur
and madame have rung the chapel bell

669
00:48:27,914 --> 00:48:32,218
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

670
00:48:34,087 --> 00:48:38,255
They furnished off an apartment
with a two-room Roebucks sale

671
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,430
The 'coolerador was crammed
with TV dinners and ginger ale

672
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:50,205
But when Pierre found work
the little money comin' worked out well

673
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:56,576
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

674
00:48:58,278 --> 00:49:02,652
They had a hi-fi phono
and boy did they let it blast

675
00:49:04,684 --> 00:49:08,954
Seven hundred little records
all rock, rhythm and jazz

676
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:14,790
But when the sun went down
the rapid tempo of the music fell

677
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:21,763
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

678
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:51,496
They had a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well

679
00:49:53,534 --> 00:49:57,496
You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle

680
00:50:32,707 --> 00:50:35,907
Is that what you call
an uncomfortable silence?

681
00:50:35,976 --> 00:50:39,346
I don't know what you call that.

682
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:42,043
- Drinks! Music!

683
00:50:43,049 --> 00:50:45,281
I'm gonna take a piss.

684
00:50:45,352 --> 00:50:50,317
That's a little bit more information
than I needed, but go right ahead.

685
00:51:03,403 --> 00:51:05,305
<i>Girl</i>

686
00:51:05,372 --> 00:51:07,239
<i>Bomp, bomp, bom</i>

687
00:51:07,307 --> 00:51:10,803
<i>You'll be a woman soon</i>

688
00:51:13,981 --> 00:51:16,451
<i>I love you so much</i>
<i>Can't count all the ways</i>

689
00:51:16,517 --> 00:51:19,512
<i>I'd die for you, girl</i>
<i>and all they can say is</i>

690
00:51:19,587 --> 00:51:22,787
<i>He's not your kind</i>

691
00:51:22,857 --> 00:51:28,095
<i>You never get tired of putting me down</i>
<i>and I never know when I come around</i>

692
00:51:28,162 --> 00:51:30,531
<i>What I'm gonna find</i>

693
00:51:30,598 --> 00:51:34,698
<i>Don't let them make up your mind</i>

694
00:51:34,769 --> 00:51:37,639
<i>Don't you know, girl</i>

695
00:51:39,006 --> 00:51:42,639
<i>You'll be a woman soon</i>

696
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:45,807
One drink, and that's it.

697
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,718
Don't be rude.
Drink your drink, but do it quickly.

698
00:51:51,285 --> 00:51:53,756
Say good night...
and go home.

699
00:51:56,157 --> 00:52:00,291
<i>You'll be a woman soon</i>

700
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:03,556
<i>Soon</i>

701
00:52:04,799 --> 00:52:08,101
<i>You'll be a woman</i>

702
00:52:09,837 --> 00:52:12,569
<i>I've been misunderstood</i>
<i>for all of my life</i>

703
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:15,043
<i>But what they're sayin', girl</i>
<i>it cuts like a knife</i>

704
00:52:15,044 --> 00:52:17,410
<i>The boy's no good</i>

705
00:52:17,478 --> 00:52:20,191
<i>Well, I've finally have found</i>
<i>what I been lookin' for</i>

706
00:52:20,247 --> 00:52:24,654
<i>But if they get a chance</i>
<i>they'll end it for sure Sure they would</i>

707
00:52:24,718 --> 00:52:27,416
<i>Baby, I've done all I could</i>

708
00:52:27,488 --> 00:52:32,157
You see, this is
a moral test of oneself.

709
00:52:32,226 --> 00:52:35,494
Whether or not
you can maintain loyalty.

710
00:52:35,564 --> 00:52:38,866
Because... being loyal
is very important.

711
00:52:38,933 --> 00:52:43,534
<i>You never get tired of putting me down</i>
<i>and I never know when I come around</i>

712
00:52:43,605 --> 00:52:46,235
<i>What I'm gonna find</i>

713
00:52:46,307 --> 00:52:50,270
<i>Don't let them make up your mind</i>

714
00:52:50,344 --> 00:52:53,180
<i>Don't you know, girl</i>

715
00:52:54,782 --> 00:52:58,620
<i>You'll be a woman soon</i>

716
00:53:00,154 --> 00:53:02,090
<i>Please</i>

717
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:06,456
<i>Come take my hand</i>

718
00:53:08,597 --> 00:53:10,533
<i>Girl</i>

719
00:53:11,866 --> 00:53:15,806
<i>You'll be a woman soon</i>

720
00:53:17,204 --> 00:53:19,140
<i>Please</i>

721
00:53:20,174 --> 00:53:23,374
<i>Come take my hand</i>

722
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:27,015
- Hello.
<i>- Girl</i>

723
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:32,523
So, you're gonna go out there
and you're gonna say, "Good night.

724
00:53:32,587 --> 00:53:35,114
I've had a very lovely evening."

725
00:53:35,189 --> 00:53:40,257
Walk out the door, get in the car, go home,
jerk off, and that's all you gonna do.

726
00:53:45,099 --> 00:53:48,037
<i>Now it's up to you, girl</i>

727
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:53,734
<i>You'll be a woman soon</i>

728
00:53:55,409 --> 00:53:58,313
<i>- Please</i>

729
00:53:58,379 --> 00:54:01,010
<i>Come take my hand</i>

730
00:54:03,585 --> 00:54:06,887
<i>- Girl</i>

731
00:54:06,955 --> 00:54:10,656
<i>You'll be a woman soon</i>

732
00:54:12,393 --> 00:54:14,329
<i>Soon</i>

733
00:54:15,396 --> 00:54:18,493
<i>You'll be a woman</i>

734
00:54:28,076 --> 00:54:30,376
All right, Mia.

735
00:54:30,444 --> 00:54:33,542
So listen, I gotta go,
all right?

736
00:54:36,685 --> 00:54:40,055
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

737
00:54:40,121 --> 00:54:42,854
You fu-
Oh, Jesus Christ!

738
00:54:42,924 --> 00:54:45,224
Oh, fuck me.
Fuck me!

739
00:54:45,293 --> 00:54:49,985
Oh-Come on, girl. We're gettin'
outta here. We gotta walk now.

740
00:54:59,757 --> 00:55:02,854
Don't fuckin' die on me, Mia!

741
00:55:02,926 --> 00:55:04,862
Fuck!

742
00:55:12,036 --> 00:55:13,970
Answer.

743
00:55:13,971 --> 00:55:16,542
<i>- Have you got the ring?</i>

744
00:55:16,543 --> 00:55:20,374
<i>- Why, certainly.</i>
<i>- Join hands, you two lovebirds.</i>

745
00:55:20,375 --> 00:55:22,948
<i>-  Please! Please!</i>

746
00:55:22,949 --> 00:55:25,611
<i>- Yes, yes.</i>
<i>- Hold hands, you lovebirds.</i>

747
00:55:31,855 --> 00:55:34,018
Fuck you, Lance!
Answer!

748
00:55:39,096 --> 00:55:41,032
<i>Now what do you say?</i>

749
00:55:41,098 --> 00:55:44,036
<i>I give up!</i>
<i>I'll marry you!</i>

750
00:55:44,101 --> 00:55:48,770
- Lance! The goddamn phone's ringing!

751
00:55:50,474 --> 00:55:52,408
I can hear it.

752
00:55:52,409 --> 00:55:55,982
I thought you told those fuckin'
assholes never to call here this late!

753
00:55:55,983 --> 00:55:57,915
Yeah, I told them.

754
00:55:57,981 --> 00:56:01,655
And that is exactly what I'm going
to tell this fucking asshole right now.

755
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:05,713
<i>Don't you dare strike me!</i> 
- Hello.

756
00:56:05,724 --> 00:56:07,990
Lance! Vincent.

757
00:56:08,058 --> 00:56:10,996
I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man.
I'm coming to your house.

758
00:56:11,061 --> 00:56:15,157
W-Whoa. Whoa. Hold your horses, man.
W-What's the problem?

759
00:56:15,158 --> 00:56:18,571
- I got this chick, she's fuckin' O.
D.in' on me! - Well, don't bring her here!

760
00:56:18,572 --> 00:56:22,908
I'm not even joking with you! Do not be
bringing some fucked-up pooh-bah to my house!

761
00:56:22,973 --> 00:56:25,034
- No choice.
- Wh- She's O.D'in'?

762
00:56:25,109 --> 00:56:28,309
- She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!
- Just dandy.

763
00:56:28,378 --> 00:56:32,580
Okay, then you bite the fuckin' bullet,
take her to a hospital and call a lawyer.

764
00:56:32,581 --> 00:56:35,154
- Negative!
- This is not my fuckin' problem, man!

765
00:56:35,155 --> 00:56:38,887
You fucked her up,
you fuckin' deal with this!

766
00:56:38,956 --> 00:56:41,792
Uh, are you talkin' to me
on a cellular phone?

767
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:44,296
I don't know you.
Who is this? Don't come here!

768
00:56:44,361 --> 00:56:47,698
I'm hanging up the phone!
Prank caller! Prank caller!

769
00:56:55,774 --> 00:56:58,712
-  What the hell was that?

770
00:57:00,678 --> 00:57:03,111
Have you lost your fucking mind?

771
00:57:03,112 --> 00:57:06,184
- You were talking about drug
shit on a cellular phone! - Lance, help me.

772
00:57:06,185 --> 00:57:09,187
- You crashed your car
into my fucking house! - Grab her feet.

773
00:57:09,188 --> 00:57:12,691
Are you deaf? You are not bringing
this fucked-up bitch into my house!

774
00:57:12,692 --> 00:57:15,628
This "fucked-up bitch"
is Marsellus Wallace's wife.

775
00:57:15,693 --> 00:57:18,129
- Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is?
- Yeah.

776
00:57:18,195 --> 00:57:21,133
If she croaks on me,
I am a fucking grease spot!

777
00:57:21,198 --> 00:57:25,799
I will be forced to tell him that you
did not help and let her die on your lawn.

778
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:28,808
Now, come on. Help me, help me.
Pick her up.

779
00:57:29,874 --> 00:57:31,810
- Shit.

780
00:57:33,878 --> 00:57:36,246
Lance!

781
00:57:36,313 --> 00:57:38,249
Shit.

782
00:57:38,315 --> 00:57:40,752
It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.

783
00:57:40,819 --> 00:57:44,155
What the fuck's going on out here?

784
00:57:44,222 --> 00:57:46,158
Who's she?

785
00:57:46,224 --> 00:57:49,162
Go to the fridge and get the thing
with the adrenalin shot.

786
00:57:49,227 --> 00:57:51,288
- What's wrong with her?
- She's O.D.ing!

787
00:57:51,289 --> 00:57:53,499
- Get her outta here!
-  Get the shot!

788
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:57,028
- Fuck you! Fuck you too!
- What a fuckin' bitch.

789
00:57:57,101 --> 00:57:59,037
Just keep talking to her,
all right?

790
00:57:59,038 --> 00:58:02,107
She's gettin' the shot. I'm going
to go get my little black medical book.

791
00:58:02,108 --> 00:58:04,176
What the fuck you need
a medical book for?

792
00:58:04,177 --> 00:58:06,178
I've never had to give
an adrenalin shot before!

793
00:58:06,179 --> 00:58:09,683
I don't go joy-poppin' with bubble-
gummers! My friends can handle their highs!

794
00:58:09,684 --> 00:58:12,117
- Get the shot!
- I am, if you'll let me!

795
00:58:12,118 --> 00:58:15,188
- I ain't stopping you!
- Stop talking to me. Start talking to her!

796
00:58:15,189 --> 00:58:17,122
- Get the shot!
- All right!

797
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:23,731
-  Hurry up. We're losing
her! - I'm looking as fast as I can!

798
00:58:23,795 --> 00:58:25,731
What's he looking for?

799
00:58:25,732 --> 00:58:28,801
-  I don't know. Some book.
- What are you looking for?

800
00:58:28,802 --> 00:58:31,738
- A little black medical book.
- What are you looking for?

801
00:58:31,803 --> 00:58:35,903
My little black medical book! It's
like a textbook they give to nurses.

802
00:58:35,974 --> 00:58:38,909
- I never saw no medical book.
- Trust me. I have one.

803
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:41,982
- If it's so important, why don't
you keep it with the shot? - I don't know!

804
00:58:41,983 --> 00:58:45,986
- Stop bothering me!
- While you're looking, that girl's gonna die on our carpet.

805
00:58:45,987 --> 00:58:47,987
You're never gonna find
anything in this mess!

806
00:58:47,988 --> 00:58:51,892
- I'm gonna fucking kill you
if you don't shut up! - Lance, get in here!

807
00:58:51,956 --> 00:58:56,192
- Right? Pig.
- Get the fuck outta my way.

808
00:58:56,261 --> 00:58:59,701
- Quit fuckin' around and give her
the shot. - While I'm doing this,

809
00:58:59,764 --> 00:59:03,097
you take off her shirt
and find her heart.

810
00:59:03,098 --> 00:59:06,806
- Does it gotta be exact?
- We're giving her a shot in the heart, so it's gotta be exact.

811
00:59:06,807 --> 00:59:09,808
I don't know exactly where her heart is.
I think it's right here.

812
00:59:09,809 --> 00:59:13,473
- That's it.
- All right, what I need is a big, fat magic marker.

813
00:59:13,545 --> 00:59:15,480
- You got it?
- What?

814
00:59:15,547 --> 00:59:18,245
A magic marker.
A felt pen!

815
00:59:18,316 --> 00:59:20,947
A fuckin' black magic marker!
Christ.

816
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:26,087
- Come on, man. Hurry up!
- Fuck! Okay, okay. Okay. I think it's ready.

817
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:31,754
- Hurry up, man.
- I'll tell you what to do.

818
00:59:31,755 --> 00:59:34,832
- You're gonna give her the shot.
- No, you're gonna give her the shot.

819
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:37,838
- I ain't giving her the shot. I never done this before.
- I never done this either!

820
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:40,907
I ain't starting now! You brought her here.
You give her the shot.

821
00:59:40,908 --> 00:59:44,310
The day I bring an O.D'ing bitch
to your house, then I give her the shot.

822
00:59:44,375 --> 00:59:46,311
Give it to me.
Give me that.

823
00:59:46,377 --> 00:59:49,312
All right, tell me what to do.

824
00:59:49,313 --> 00:59:52,449
Okay, you're giving her an injection
of adrenalin straight to her heart.

825
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:55,455
But she's got a breastplate.
You gotta pierce through that.

826
00:59:55,456 --> 00:59:58,391
You gotta bring the needle
down in a stabbing motion.

827
00:59:58,456 --> 01:00:01,895
- I gotta-I gotta stab her three times?
- No, just stab her once!

828
01:00:01,896 --> 01:00:05,465
But it's gotta be hard enough to get
through her.. breastplate into her heart.

829
01:00:05,466 --> 01:00:08,400
Once you do that,
you p-press down on the p-plunger.

830
01:00:08,401 --> 01:00:11,037
- Okay. Then what happens?
- Kinda curious about that myself.

831
01:00:11,038 --> 01:00:13,973
This ain't no fuckin' joke!
Am I gonna kill her?

832
01:00:13,974 --> 01:00:17,546
- She's supposed to come out of it like
that. It's... All right, count to three.

833
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:19,740
- All right. Ready?
- One.

834
01:00:25,017 --> 01:00:26,543
Two.

835
01:00:34,526 --> 01:00:36,495
Three!

836
01:00:51,076 --> 01:00:54,344
If you're all right,
then say something.

837
01:00:54,412 --> 01:00:57,441
Something.

838
01:00:57,516 --> 01:00:59,451
That was fuckin' trippy.

839
01:01:02,021 --> 01:01:05,357
- Ohh.
- Oh, man.

840
01:01:30,049 --> 01:01:31,985
Mia. Mia.

841
01:01:34,153 --> 01:01:36,590
What's-

842
01:01:36,655 --> 01:01:39,455
What's your thoughts on-on-

843
01:01:39,526 --> 01:01:41,553
on how to handle this?

844
01:01:41,627 --> 01:01:43,563
What's yours?

845
01:01:46,632 --> 01:01:50,538
Well, I'm of the opinion
that if Marsellus lived his whole life,

846
01:01:50,603 --> 01:01:54,605
he doesn't need to know
nothing about this incident.

847
01:01:54,734 --> 01:01:57,535
If Marsellus knew
about this incident,

848
01:01:57,604 --> 01:01:59,665
I'd be in as much trouble as you.

849
01:01:59,739 --> 01:02:02,233
I seriously doubt that.

850
01:02:02,308 --> 01:02:05,246
I can keep a secret if you can.

851
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,216
Shake on it?

852
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:16,721
Mum's the word?

853
01:02:16,789 --> 01:02:18,725
Cool.

854
01:02:18,791 --> 01:02:23,129
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going
to go home and have a heart attack.

855
01:02:25,865 --> 01:02:27,801
Vincent.

856
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:32,699
Do you wanna hear
my Fox Force Five joke?

857
01:02:33,774 --> 01:02:35,710
Sure.

858
01:02:35,776 --> 01:02:38,805
Except I think I'm still
a little too petrified to laugh.

859
01:02:38,879 --> 01:02:41,817
No, you won't laugh
'cause it's not funny.

860
01:02:41,882 --> 01:02:45,218
But if you still wanna hear it,
I'll tell it.

861
01:02:45,284 --> 01:02:47,481
- I can't wait.
- Okay.

862
01:02:47,554 --> 01:02:50,423
Three tomatoes
are walkin' down the street.

863
01:02:50,489 --> 01:02:52,926
Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato
and Baby Tomato.

864
01:02:52,992 --> 01:02:57,160
Baby Tomato starts lagging behind,
and Papa Tomato gets really angry.

865
01:02:57,229 --> 01:03:00,167
Goes back and squishes him
and says,

866
01:03:00,232 --> 01:03:02,327
"Ketchup."

867
01:03:05,171 --> 01:03:07,107
Ketchup.

868
01:03:11,243 --> 01:03:13,372
See you around.

869
01:03:34,433 --> 01:03:38,134
Oh, that Paddlefoot.
He funny, silly dog.

870
01:03:38,205 --> 01:03:41,143
He think totem pole alive!

871
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:43,941
He arctic tenderfoot!

872
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:47,673
That totem pole been here forever!

873
01:03:47,674 --> 01:03:49,751
-  Butch?

874
01:03:49,752 --> 01:03:52,643
One more thing, and we'll start for-

875
01:03:52,686 --> 01:03:55,624
- Butch, stop watching TV for a second.
- Yeah?

876
01:03:55,689 --> 01:03:59,321
- You've got a special visitor.
-  Stand up. Stand up.

877
01:04:02,095 --> 01:04:07,037
Now, do you remember when I told you
your daddy died in a P.O.W. camp?

878
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:10,835
Well, this here is Captain Koons.

879
01:04:10,904 --> 01:04:13,842
He was in the P.O.W. camp
with Daddy.

880
01:04:19,179 --> 01:04:21,115
Hello, little man.

881
01:04:21,181 --> 01:04:25,281
Boy, I sure heard
a bunch about you.

882
01:04:25,352 --> 01:04:28,587
See, I was a good friend
of your dad's.

883
01:04:28,655 --> 01:04:31,684
We were in that Hanoi
pit of hell together...

884
01:04:31,758 --> 01:04:34,228
over five years.

885
01:04:34,294 --> 01:04:36,230
Hopefully...

886
01:04:36,296 --> 01:04:39,234
you'll never have to
experience this yourself,

887
01:04:39,299 --> 01:04:42,739
but when two men are in a situation
like me and your dad were...

888
01:04:42,803 --> 01:04:45,604
for as long as we were,

889
01:04:45,672 --> 01:04:49,976
you take on certain responsibilities
of the other.

890
01:04:50,043 --> 01:04:51,979
If it'd been me who'd-

891
01:04:53,313 --> 01:04:55,249
not made it,

892
01:04:55,315 --> 01:04:59,586
Major Coolidge'd be talking right now
to my son Jim.

893
01:04:59,654 --> 01:05:03,320
But the way it turned out,
I'm talking to you.

894
01:05:04,724 --> 01:05:06,660
Butch...

895
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:10,131
I got something for ya.

896
01:05:16,637 --> 01:05:18,698
This watch I got here...

897
01:05:18,772 --> 01:05:23,578
was first purchased by your great-
grandfather during the first World War.

898
01:05:23,644 --> 01:05:28,312
It was bought in a little general store
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

899
01:05:28,381 --> 01:05:31,946
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

900
01:05:32,018 --> 01:05:34,956
Up 'til then, people just
carried pocket watches.

901
01:05:35,021 --> 01:05:38,187
It was bought
by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...

902
01:05:38,258 --> 01:05:41,196
on the day he set sail for Paris.

903
01:05:41,261 --> 01:05:43,698
This was your
great-grandfather's war watch,

904
01:05:43,764 --> 01:05:47,134
and he wore it every day
he was in that war, and...

905
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,765
when he'd done his duty,
he went home to your great-grandmother,

906
01:05:50,838 --> 01:05:55,279
took the watch off, put it in an old
coffee can, and in that can it stayed...

907
01:05:55,342 --> 01:05:59,784
until your granddad, Dane Coolidge,
was called upon by his country...

908
01:05:59,847 --> 01:06:03,582
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

909
01:06:03,651 --> 01:06:07,112
This time they called it
World War ll.

910
01:06:07,187 --> 01:06:12,186
Your great-grandfather gave this watch
to your granddad for good luck.

911
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:15,272
Unfortunately, Dane's luck
wasn't as good as his old man's.

912
01:06:15,328 --> 01:06:18,266
Dane was a Marine,
and he was killed...

913
01:06:18,331 --> 01:06:22,362
along with all the other Marines
at the battle of Wake lsland.

914
01:06:22,435 --> 01:06:25,373
Your granddad was facing death.

915
01:06:25,438 --> 01:06:27,374
He knew it.

916
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:31,380
None of those boys ever had any illusions
about leaving that island alive,

917
01:06:31,444 --> 01:06:34,645
so three days before the Japanese
took the island,

918
01:06:34,715 --> 01:06:39,953
your granddad asked a gunner on
an Air Force transport, name of Winocki-

919
01:06:40,021 --> 01:06:42,959
a man he'd never met before
in his life-

920
01:06:43,024 --> 01:06:45,996
to deliver to his infant son,

921
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:50,661
who he'd never seen in the flesh,
his gold watch.

922
01:06:50,731 --> 01:06:55,069
Three days later, your granddad
was dead, but Winocki kept his word.

923
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:59,406
After the war was over,
he paid a visit to your grandmother,

924
01:06:59,472 --> 01:07:03,709
delivering to your infant father
his dad's gold watch.

925
01:07:03,778 --> 01:07:05,714
This watch.

926
01:07:11,586 --> 01:07:17,029
This watch was on your daddy's wrist
when he was shot down over Hanoi.

927
01:07:17,091 --> 01:07:20,531
He was captured,
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

928
01:07:20,595 --> 01:07:24,660
He knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch,

929
01:07:24,732 --> 01:07:28,262
it'd be confiscated, taken away.

930
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:32,036
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

931
01:07:32,037 --> 01:07:36,112
He'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their
greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright,

932
01:07:36,113 --> 01:07:40,050
so he hid it in one place he knew
he could hide something - his ass.

933
01:07:40,114 --> 01:07:43,554
Five long years
he wore this watch - up his ass.

934
01:07:43,618 --> 01:07:47,820
Then he died of dysentery-
He give me the watch.

935
01:07:47,888 --> 01:07:51,760
I hid this uncomfortable
hunk of metal up my ass two years.

936
01:07:51,826 --> 01:07:53,762
Then...

937
01:07:53,828 --> 01:07:57,893
after seven years,
I was sent home to my family and...

938
01:07:57,965 --> 01:07:59,901
now...

939
01:08:02,336 --> 01:08:05,274
Iittle man,
I give the watch to you.

940
01:08:28,129 --> 01:08:30,065
It's time, Butch.

941
01:08:37,806 --> 01:08:40,744
ln the heavyweight division,

942
01:08:40,809 --> 01:08:43,975
- in the right corner
wearing the blue trunks, -

943
01:08:44,045 --> 01:08:47,313
weighing 210 pounds,

944
01:08:47,381 --> 01:08:50,513
Floyd Ray Wilson!

945
01:08:53,523 --> 01:08:55,589
It's official. It's official.

946
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:58,595
- Wilson is dead!
-  Well, Dan, that had to be the bloodiest,

947
01:08:58,596 --> 01:09:01,096
hands down, the most brutal fight
this city's ever seen.

948
01:09:01,097 --> 01:09:04,767
Coolidge was out of there faster than I've
ever seen a victorious boxer leave the ring.

949
01:09:04,768 --> 01:09:07,770
- Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?
- My guess would be yes.

950
01:09:07,771 --> 01:09:11,274
I could see the frenzy in his eyes give way
to the realization of what he was doing.

951
01:09:11,275 --> 01:09:14,777
- I think any man would've left the ring that fast.
- Do you feel this tragedy...

952
01:09:14,778 --> 01:09:16,712
is gonna affect
the world of boxing?

953
01:09:16,713 --> 01:09:20,784
A tragedy like this can't help but shake the
world of boxing to its very foundations.

954
01:09:20,785 --> 01:09:24,788
It's of paramount importance, during the sad
weeks ahead, the eyes of the W.B.A. remain-

955
01:09:59,554 --> 01:10:01,888
Man, you know I didn't-

956
01:10:01,957 --> 01:10:04,895
- Marsellus.
- No, it wasn't. I didn't do it.

957
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,896
I didn't do it.

958
01:10:06,962 --> 01:10:09,455
- How you doing?
- Great.

959
01:10:09,531 --> 01:10:11,967
I never thanked you for dinner.

960
01:10:13,869 --> 01:10:15,805
- What you got?
- He booked.

961
01:10:15,871 --> 01:10:18,967
- His trainer?
- Says he don't know nothin'. I believe him.

962
01:10:18,968 --> 01:10:22,546
- I think Butch surprised his ass same
as us. - No, we don't wanna "think."

963
01:10:22,547 --> 01:10:26,142
We wanna know. Take him to
the kennel, sic the dogs on his ass.

964
01:10:26,214 --> 01:10:29,653
We'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't.

965
01:10:29,654 --> 01:10:31,721
Butch's search-
How do you want it done?

966
01:10:31,722 --> 01:10:34,658
I'm prepared to scour the Earth
for that motherfucker.

967
01:10:34,723 --> 01:10:38,162
If Butch goes to lndochina, I want
a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...

968
01:10:38,226 --> 01:10:40,355
ready to pop a cap in his ass.

969
01:10:40,428 --> 01:10:42,568
I will take care of it.

970
01:10:52,308 --> 01:10:54,677
Mister.

971
01:10:57,581 --> 01:11:00,074
- Hey, mister.
- What?

972
01:11:00,149 --> 01:11:04,955
You were in that fight,
the fight on the radio.

973
01:11:05,021 --> 01:11:08,460
- You're the fighter?
- Whatever gave you that idea?

974
01:11:08,525 --> 01:11:11,291
No, come on.

975
01:11:11,361 --> 01:11:13,297
You're him.

976
01:11:13,363 --> 01:11:15,800
I know you're him.

977
01:11:17,534 --> 01:11:19,435
Tell me you're him.

978
01:11:19,502 --> 01:11:21,438
I'm him.

979
01:11:22,539 --> 01:11:24,975
You killed the other boxing man.

980
01:11:28,612 --> 01:11:30,707
He's dead?

981
01:11:30,781 --> 01:11:33,217
The radio said he was dead.

982
01:11:35,985 --> 01:11:38,217
Sorry about that, Floyd.

983
01:11:39,523 --> 01:11:42,016
What does it feel like?

984
01:11:42,091 --> 01:11:44,027
What does what feel like?

985
01:11:44,093 --> 01:11:46,029
Killing a man.

986
01:11:47,798 --> 01:11:51,863
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.

987
01:11:51,934 --> 01:11:53,870
What are you, a weirdo?

988
01:11:53,936 --> 01:11:55,872
No.

989
01:11:55,939 --> 01:11:59,378
It is a subject
I have much interest in.

990
01:12:00,944 --> 01:12:04,884
You are the first person
I have ever met who has killed somebody.

991
01:12:07,383 --> 01:12:09,820
So?

992
01:12:09,887 --> 01:12:13,155
- What does it feel like to kill a man?

993
01:12:14,257 --> 01:12:16,193
I'll tell you what.

994
01:12:16,259 --> 01:12:20,199
Give me one of them cigarettes you got up
there, and I'll tell you all about it.

995
01:12:37,915 --> 01:12:41,149
So, Esmarelda...

996
01:12:42,452 --> 01:12:45,857
Villa Lobos-
Is that Mexican?

997
01:12:45,923 --> 01:12:49,157
The name is Spanish,
but I am Colombian.

998
01:12:49,226 --> 01:12:52,529
- That's some handle
you got there, honey. - Thank you.

999
01:12:52,596 --> 01:12:54,532
And what is your name?

1000
01:12:54,598 --> 01:12:56,294
Butch.

1001
01:12:56,366 --> 01:12:58,837
Butch.

1002
01:12:58,902 --> 01:13:03,674
- What does it mean?
- I'm an American, honey. Our names don't mean shit.

1003
01:13:03,741 --> 01:13:06,405
So, moving right along,

1004
01:13:06,476 --> 01:13:08,412
Esmarelda,

1005
01:13:08,478 --> 01:13:10,745
what is it you want to know?

1006
01:13:10,814 --> 01:13:15,688
- I want to know what it feels like
to kill a man. - I couldn't tell ya.

1007
01:13:21,592 --> 01:13:26,033
Didn't know he was dead
'til you told me he was dead.

1008
01:13:26,096 --> 01:13:30,697
Now that I know he's dead,
you wanna know how I feel about it?

1009
01:13:34,438 --> 01:13:37,878
I don't feel
the least bit bad about it.

1010
01:13:48,852 --> 01:13:51,288
What the fuck'd I tell ya?
Huh?

1011
01:13:51,355 --> 01:13:55,295
As soon as the word got out the fix was
in, man, the odds went through the roof.

1012
01:13:55,359 --> 01:13:57,557
I know. I know.
Unbelievable.

1013
01:13:57,628 --> 01:14:01,067
Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was
a better boxer, he'd still be alive.

1014
01:14:01,131 --> 01:14:03,065
If he never laced up his gloves,

1015
01:14:03,066 --> 01:14:05,638
which he never shoulda done in the first
fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.

1016
01:14:07,639 --> 01:14:11,237
Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?
It's over now.

1017
01:14:11,308 --> 01:14:14,246
Yeah, well, enough about the poor,
unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

1018
01:14:14,311 --> 01:14:18,012
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr. Butch.

1019
01:14:18,081 --> 01:14:21,019
How many bookies did you
lay it around on?

1020
01:14:21,084 --> 01:14:23,521
All eight?
How long to collect?

1021
01:14:25,155 --> 01:14:28,093
So you'll have it all
by tomorrow night? No, I understand.

1022
01:14:28,158 --> 01:14:31,324
A few stragglers aside.
Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.

1023
01:14:31,395 --> 01:14:33,628
That is great news, man.

1024
01:14:33,698 --> 01:14:37,900
Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me and Fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.

1025
01:14:37,968 --> 01:14:41,236
It'll probably take us
a couple days to get down to Knoxville.

1026
01:14:41,305 --> 01:14:43,241
Okay, my brother.

1027
01:14:43,307 --> 01:14:45,277
You're right.

1028
01:14:45,342 --> 01:14:47,677
You're goddamn right.

1029
01:14:47,745 --> 01:14:51,240
All right, Scotty, next time I see you,
it'll be on Tennessee time.

1030
01:14:51,315 --> 01:14:53,650
Cool, brother.

1031
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,236
$45.60.

1032
01:15:14,806 --> 01:15:16,742
And, uh,

1033
01:15:16,808 --> 01:15:20,110
here's a little something
for the effort.

1034
01:15:20,177 --> 01:15:24,117
Now, if anybody asks you who your fare
was tonight, what are you gonna say?

1035
01:15:24,181 --> 01:15:26,117
The truth.

1036
01:15:26,183 --> 01:15:29,679
Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted Mexicans.

1037
01:15:31,589 --> 01:15:33,991
Bonsoir, Esmarelda Villa Lobos.

1038
01:15:34,058 --> 01:15:36,586
Buenas Noches, Butch.

1039
01:15:47,705 --> 01:15:49,641
Whew.

1040
01:15:51,009 --> 01:15:53,002
Keep the light off.

1041
01:15:53,077 --> 01:15:56,015
- Is that better, Sugar Pop?
- Oui.

1042
01:16:00,484 --> 01:16:02,420
Hard day at the office?

1043
01:16:02,486 --> 01:16:04,422
Pretty hard.

1044
01:16:04,488 --> 01:16:06,721
Got in a fight.

1045
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:08,954
Poor baby.

1046
01:16:09,027 --> 01:16:11,590
Can you make spoons?

1047
01:16:11,663 --> 01:16:14,601
You know what?
I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.

1048
01:16:14,666 --> 01:16:18,606
- I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.
- I like the way you stink.

1049
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:21,106
Let me take this jacket off.

1050
01:16:23,274 --> 01:16:26,805
- I was looking at myself in the mirror.
- Uh-huh.

1051
01:16:26,878 --> 01:16:28,814
I wish I had a pot.

1052
01:16:30,582 --> 01:16:34,522
You were looking at yourself in the
mirror, and you wish you had some pot?

1053
01:16:34,586 --> 01:16:37,524
A pot.
A pot belly.

1054
01:16:37,589 --> 01:16:39,752
Pot bellies are sexy.

1055
01:16:39,824 --> 01:16:42,124
Well, you should be happy,

1056
01:16:42,193 --> 01:16:44,129
'cause you have one.

1057
01:16:44,195 --> 01:16:47,657
Shut up, fatso.
I don't have a pot.

1058
01:16:47,732 --> 01:16:51,604
I have a bit of a tummy,
like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star."

1059
01:16:51,669 --> 01:16:53,605
It's not the same thing.

1060
01:16:53,671 --> 01:16:57,611
I didn't know there was such a difference
between a pot belly and a tummy.

1061
01:16:57,675 --> 01:16:59,611
The difference is huge.

1062
01:16:59,677 --> 01:17:03,116
Would you like it if I had a pot belly?

1063
01:17:03,181 --> 01:17:05,117
No.

1064
01:17:05,183 --> 01:17:09,625
Pot bellies make a man
look either oafish or like a gorilla.

1065
01:17:09,687 --> 01:17:12,784
But on a woman
a pot belly's very sexy.

1066
01:17:12,857 --> 01:17:18,300
The rest of you is normal-normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal ass-

1067
01:17:18,363 --> 01:17:22,428
but with a big,
perfectly round pot belly.

1068
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:25,438
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt
two sizes too small...

1069
01:17:25,503 --> 01:17:27,439
to accentuate it.

1070
01:17:27,505 --> 01:17:29,942
You think men
would find that attractive?

1071
01:17:30,008 --> 01:17:33,171
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.

1072
01:17:33,172 --> 01:17:36,784
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing
to the touch and pleasing to the eye...

1073
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:38,718
is seldom the same.

1074
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:45,719
If you had a pot belly,
I would punch you in it.

1075
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:48,729
- You'd punch me in the belly?
- Right in the belly.

1076
01:17:48,794 --> 01:17:50,730
Ohh! I'd smother you!

1077
01:17:50,796 --> 01:17:54,736
- I'd drop it right on your face
'til you couldn't breathe! -

1078
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,736
- You'd do that?
- Yeah.

1079
01:17:56,802 --> 01:17:58,772
- Promise?
- Yeah.

1080
01:18:02,273 --> 01:18:04,209
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1081
01:18:06,444 --> 01:18:08,881
Oh.

1082
01:18:12,316 --> 01:18:14,252
Did you get everything?

1083
01:18:14,318 --> 01:18:17,313
- Yes, I did.
- Good job, Sugar Pop.

1084
01:18:17,388 --> 01:18:19,324
Did everything go as planned?

1085
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:22,123
- You didn't listen to the-Ow!

1086
01:18:22,193 --> 01:18:24,129
You didn't listen to the radio?

1087
01:18:24,195 --> 01:18:27,497
I never listen to your fights.
Were you the winner?

1088
01:18:27,566 --> 01:18:29,866
I won, all right.

1089
01:18:29,935 --> 01:18:32,907
- Are you still retiring?
- Sure am.

1090
01:18:32,971 --> 01:18:35,339
So it all worked out
in the finish.

1091
01:18:36,775 --> 01:18:40,214
We're not at the finish yet, baby.

1092
01:18:48,153 --> 01:18:51,023
We're in a lot of danger,
aren't we?

1093
01:18:52,591 --> 01:18:55,529
If they find us,
they'll kill us, won't they?

1094
01:18:57,596 --> 01:19:00,534
But they won't find us,
will they?

1095
01:19:03,434 --> 01:19:06,372
Do you still want me
to go with you?

1096
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:11,607
I don't want to be a burden
or a nuisance. It's-

1097
01:19:18,217 --> 01:19:20,586
Say it.

1098
01:19:20,652 --> 01:19:23,248
- Fabienne,

1099
01:19:23,322 --> 01:19:26,453
I want you to be with me.

1100
01:19:26,525 --> 01:19:29,520
- Forever?
- Forever and ever.

1101
01:19:31,663 --> 01:19:33,633
Do you love me?

1102
01:19:33,699 --> 01:19:35,692
Very, very much.

1103
01:19:41,406 --> 01:19:43,969
- Butch.
- Yes?

1104
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:48,007
Will you give me oral pleasure?

1105
01:19:49,516 --> 01:19:51,451
Will you kiss it?

1106
01:19:53,385 --> 01:19:55,583
But you first.

1107
01:19:55,654 --> 01:19:58,489
- Okay.
- Okay.

1108
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:11,000
Butch.

1109
01:20:11,069 --> 01:20:14,508
Mon amour.
L'aventure commence.

1110
01:20:30,162 --> 01:20:32,599
I think I cracked a rib.

1111
01:20:32,666 --> 01:20:36,105
- Giving me oral pleasure?
- No, retard, from the fight.

1112
01:20:36,168 --> 01:20:39,608
- Don't call me "retard."
-  My name is Fabby.

1113
01:20:39,673 --> 01:20:42,166
- My name is Fabienne!
- Stop it.

1114
01:20:42,241 --> 01:20:44,177
- Stop it!
- My name is Fabi-

1115
01:20:44,243 --> 01:20:47,181
Shut up, fuckhead!
I hate that mongoloid voice.

1116
01:20:47,246 --> 01:20:50,343
Okay, okay.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1117
01:20:50,416 --> 01:20:53,354
-  I take it back.

1118
01:20:55,354 --> 01:20:58,292
Will you hand me a dry towel,
Miss Beautiful Tulip?

1119
01:20:58,357 --> 01:21:02,297
- Oh, I like that.
I like being called a tulip. -

1120
01:21:02,361 --> 01:21:04,798
"Tulip" is much better
than "mongoloid."

1121
01:21:04,864 --> 01:21:07,802
I didn't call you a mongoloid.
I called you a retard.

1122
01:21:07,867 --> 01:21:09,996
And I took it back.

1123
01:21:10,069 --> 01:21:12,164
- Butch?

1124
01:21:12,237 --> 01:21:14,173
Yes, Lemon Pie?

1125
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:17,679
- Where are we going to go?
- Well, I'm not sure yet.

1126
01:21:17,744 --> 01:21:19,873
Wherever you want.

1127
01:21:19,946 --> 01:21:22,884
We're gonna get a lot
of money from this,

1128
01:21:22,949 --> 01:21:25,887
but it ain't gonna be
the kind of money...

1129
01:21:25,952 --> 01:21:28,890
that we can live like hogs
in the fathouse forever.

1130
01:21:28,955 --> 01:21:32,895
I was thinking maybe we could go
down someplace in the South Pacific.

1131
01:21:32,959 --> 01:21:36,398
Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna
carry us a long way down there.

1132
01:21:36,462 --> 01:21:39,400
- If we wanted,
we could live in Bora Bora? - You betcha.

1133
01:21:39,465 --> 01:21:42,905
And if after a while you didn't
dig that, we could go someplace else.

1134
01:21:42,969 --> 01:21:44,905
Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.

1135
01:21:44,971 --> 01:21:46,907
But I do not speak Spanish.

1136
01:21:46,973 --> 01:21:49,945
Well, you do not speak
Bora-Boran either.

1137
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:51,980
Besides, Mexican's easy.

1138
01:21:52,045 --> 01:21:54,983
- ¿Donde esta el zapateria?
- What does that mean?

1139
01:21:55,048 --> 01:21:56,984
Where is the shoe store?

1140
01:21:57,050 --> 01:21:58,986
- ¿Donde esta-
- Spit, please.

1141
01:22:01,054 --> 01:22:04,322
- ¿Donde esta el zapateria?
- Excellent pronunciation.

1142
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:06,417
- Mmm.

1143
01:22:06,492 --> 01:22:09,795
You'll be my little mamacita
in no time.

1144
01:22:09,863 --> 01:22:12,390
- ¿Que hora es?
- ¿Que hora es?

1145
01:22:12,464 --> 01:22:14,628
- What time is it?
- What time is it?

1146
01:22:14,701 --> 01:22:17,331
Time for bed.

1147
01:22:17,403 --> 01:22:19,339
Sweet dreams, jellybean.

1148
01:22:27,047 --> 01:22:28,983
Butch?

1149
01:22:34,888 --> 01:22:36,824
Never mind.

1150
01:22:43,797 --> 01:22:46,427
Aah!

1151
01:22:46,498 --> 01:22:50,564
Merde! You startled me.
Did you have a bad dream?

1152
01:23:01,014 --> 01:23:05,284
- What is this you're watching?
- A motorcycle movie.

1153
01:23:05,351 --> 01:23:07,287
I'm not sure the name.

1154
01:23:09,189 --> 01:23:12,286
- Are you watching it?
- In a way.

1155
01:23:14,094 --> 01:23:18,194
It's a little early in the morning
for explosions and war.

1156
01:23:21,034 --> 01:23:25,475
- What was it about?
- How should I know? You were the one watching it.

1157
01:23:25,539 --> 01:23:29,536
- No, imbecile,
what was your dream about? - I don't know.

1158
01:23:29,610 --> 01:23:31,546
I don't remember.

1159
01:23:31,612 --> 01:23:34,550
It's really rare
that I remember my dreams.

1160
01:23:34,615 --> 01:23:37,587
Well, let's look
at the grumpy man in the morning.

1161
01:23:39,586 --> 01:23:42,658
Why don't you get up
and we'll get some breakfast.

1162
01:23:42,659 --> 01:23:45,286
One more kiss, and I'll get up.

1163
01:23:47,427 --> 01:23:50,662
- Satisfied?
-  Yep.

1164
01:23:50,731 --> 01:23:54,170
-  Get up, lazy bones!
- Ohh!

1165
01:23:54,234 --> 01:23:57,297
- Ohh. God.

1166
01:23:58,606 --> 01:24:02,136
- What time is it?
- Almost nine in the morning.

1167
01:24:02,208 --> 01:24:05,978
- What time does our train arrive?
- Eleven.

1168
01:24:06,045 --> 01:24:10,418
- You know what I'm gonna
have for breakfast? - What, Lemon Pie?

1169
01:24:10,483 --> 01:24:14,618
I'm gonna order a big plate
of blueberry pancakes...

1170
01:24:14,688 --> 01:24:16,624
with maple syrup,

1171
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:20,129
eggs over easy
and five sausages.

1172
01:24:20,193 --> 01:24:22,390
Anything to drink with that?

1173
01:24:22,462 --> 01:24:26,129
Wow, that looks nice.

1174
01:24:26,199 --> 01:24:29,536
To drink-A tall glass
of orange juice...

1175
01:24:29,603 --> 01:24:32,039
and a black cup of coffee.

1176
01:24:32,105 --> 01:24:36,672
- After that, I'm going to
have a slice of pie. - Pie for breakfast?

1177
01:24:36,744 --> 01:24:40,684
-  - Any time of the
day is a good time for pie.

1178
01:24:40,748 --> 01:24:43,686
Blueberry pie
to go with the pancakes.

1179
01:24:43,751 --> 01:24:46,746
And on top, a thin slice
of melted cheese.

1180
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:48,756
Where's my watch?

1181
01:24:53,226 --> 01:24:55,492
It's there.

1182
01:24:55,563 --> 01:24:58,159
- No, it's not.
- Have you looked?

1183
01:24:58,231 --> 01:25:02,501
Yes, I've fuckin' looked.
What the fuck do you think I'm doin'?

1184
01:25:02,570 --> 01:25:04,699
You sure you got it?

1185
01:25:04,772 --> 01:25:07,072
Yes.
Bedside table drawer.

1186
01:25:07,141 --> 01:25:10,307
- On the little kangaroo?
- Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.

1187
01:25:10,376 --> 01:25:13,543
Yeah, well, it's not here now.

1188
01:25:13,614 --> 01:25:16,483
- Well, it should be.

1189
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:20,584
Yes, it most definitely should be, but it's
not here now! So where the fuck is it?

1190
01:25:25,926 --> 01:25:29,365
Fabienne,
where's my father's fucking watch?

1191
01:25:31,031 --> 01:25:35,472
Do you have any idea what he had
to go through to get me that watch?

1192
01:25:35,536 --> 01:25:38,472
I don't have time to go into it,
but he went through a lot.

1193
01:25:38,473 --> 01:25:43,948
All this other shit you could've set on fire, but I
specifically reminded you not to forget the fucking watch.

1194
01:25:43,949 --> 01:25:45,276
Now think.

1195
01:25:45,346 --> 01:25:48,877
- Did you get it?
- I believe so.

1196
01:25:48,949 --> 01:25:52,863
"You believe so"? What the fuck does
that mean? You either did or didn't get it.

1197
01:25:53,621 --> 01:25:55,557
Then I did.

1198
01:25:56,924 --> 01:25:58,860
Are you sure?

1199
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,896
No.

1200
01:26:03,998 --> 01:26:05,934
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1201
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,368
Motherfucker!
Motherfuckin'-

1202
01:26:10,271 --> 01:26:13,072
Do you know how fucking stupid
you fucking are?

1203
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:15,076
No!

1204
01:26:17,711 --> 01:26:19,647
It's not your fault.

1205
01:26:24,451 --> 01:26:26,888
You left it at the apartment.

1206
01:26:32,459 --> 01:26:35,899
If you left it at the apartment,
it's not your fault.

1207
01:26:37,965 --> 01:26:41,096
I had you bring
a bunch of stuff.

1208
01:26:43,304 --> 01:26:45,240
I reminded you about it,

1209
01:26:45,306 --> 01:26:50,078
but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me.

1210
01:26:50,144 --> 01:26:54,175
If all I gave a fuck about was
the watch, I shoulda told you that.

1211
01:26:54,248 --> 01:26:56,685
You're not a mind reader.

1212
01:26:56,751 --> 01:26:58,687
Are you?

1213
01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:10,766
I- I'm sorry.

1214
01:27:10,832 --> 01:27:14,430
Don't be. Just means
I can't have breakfast with you.

1215
01:27:14,501 --> 01:27:17,200
Why does it mean that?

1216
01:27:19,774 --> 01:27:23,110
Because I gotta go back to my apartment
and get my watch.

1217
01:27:24,311 --> 01:27:26,839
Won't the gangsters
be looking for you there?

1218
01:27:26,915 --> 01:27:31,185
Well, that's what
I'm gonna find out.

1219
01:27:31,251 --> 01:27:34,485
If they are, and I don't think
I can handle it,

1220
01:27:34,556 --> 01:27:36,491
then I'll split.

1221
01:27:36,558 --> 01:27:40,862
I saw your watch. I thought
I brought it. I'm so sorry.

1222
01:27:46,133 --> 01:27:49,196
Here's some money.
Go out and get those pancakes.

1223
01:27:49,269 --> 01:27:51,136
Have a nice breakfast.

1224
01:27:51,205 --> 01:27:54,645
I'll take your Honda. I'll be back
before you can say "blueberry pie."

1225
01:27:54,709 --> 01:27:57,145
Blueberry pie.

1226
01:27:57,211 --> 01:27:59,374
Maybe not that fast.

1227
01:27:59,446 --> 01:28:02,647
- But pretty fast. Okay?
- Okay.

1228
01:28:02,717 --> 01:28:05,051
- Bye.
- Bye.

1229
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,073
Shit! Of all the fuckin' things
she could fuckin' forget,

1230
01:28:08,123 --> 01:28:10,059
she forgets my father's watch!

1231
01:28:10,125 --> 01:28:12,061
I specifically reminded her-

1232
01:28:12,127 --> 01:28:14,256
bedside table, on the kangaroo.

1233
01:28:14,328 --> 01:28:17,597
I said the words:
"Don't forget my father's watch."

1234
01:28:33,081 --> 01:28:36,521
Visit the Jackrabbit Slim's nearest you...

1235
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:56,436

glad to help. That guy was a drunken maniac.

1255
01:35:14,128 --> 01:35:17,066
He hit you, then he
crashed into that car.

1256

- Him.

Well, bring out the Gimp.

1341
01:45:43,458 --> 01:45:45,691
You want that gun,
don't ya, Zed?

1342
01:45:47,362 --> 01:45:49,298
Huh?

1343
01:45:50,298 --> 01:45:52,234
Go ahead and pick it up.

1344
01:45:54,637 --> 01:45:56,971
Go ahead. Pick it up.

1345
01:45:59,241 --> 01:46:01,735
Come on-
Thatta boy!

1346
01:46:03,311 --> 01:46:07,411
I want you to pick it up, Zed.

1347
01:46:11,654 --> 01:46:14,717
- Step aside, Butch.

1348
01:46:26,969 --> 01:46:29,998
Fuck!

1349
01:46:32,608 --> 01:46:35,546
- You okay?

1350
01:46:36,913 --> 01:46:39,076
No, man.

1351
01:46:39,148 --> 01:46:42,086
I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay.

1352
01:46:53,262 --> 01:46:56,200
- What now?

1353
01:46:58,534 --> 01:47:00,469
"What now"?

1354
01:47:01,838 --> 01:47:05,277
- Let me tell you what now.

1355
01:47:05,341 --> 01:47:08,279
I'm gonna call a couple of hard,
pipe-hittin' niggers...

1356
01:47:08,344 --> 01:47:11,282
to go to work
on the homes here...

1357
01:47:11,347 --> 01:47:14,285
with a pair of pliers
and a blowtorch.

1358
01:47:16,252 --> 01:47:18,951
You hear me talkin',
hillbilly boy?

1359
01:47:20,223 --> 01:47:22,786
I ain't through with you
by a damn sight!

1360
01:47:22,859 --> 01:47:25,797
I'm gonna get medieval
on your ass.

1361
01:47:29,065 --> 01:47:32,003
I meant what now
between me and you.

1362
01:47:37,073 --> 01:47:39,475
Oh, that "what now."

1363
01:47:40,910 --> 01:47:44,850
- I tell you what now
between me and you. -

1364
01:47:46,415 --> 01:47:49,353
There is no me and you.

1365
01:47:50,786 --> 01:47:52,722
Not no more.

1366
01:47:55,791 --> 01:47:57,727
So, are we cool?

1367
01:47:59,095 --> 01:48:01,395
Yeah, we cool.

1368
01:48:01,464 --> 01:48:03,594
- Two things.

1369
01:48:05,368 --> 01:48:08,306
Don't tell nobody about this.

1370
01:48:09,773 --> 01:48:13,405
This shit is between me, you...

1371
01:48:13,476 --> 01:48:17,941
and Mr. "Soon-To-Be-Livin' The-Rest-
Of-His-Short-Ass-Life-ln-Agonizing-Pain"...

1372
01:48:18,014 --> 01:48:19,950
rapist here.

1373
01:48:21,250 --> 01:48:24,017
It ain't nobody else's business.

1374
01:48:24,086 --> 01:48:26,022
Two:

1375
01:48:26,088 --> 01:48:29,584
You leave town tonight.
Right now.

1376
01:48:30,827 --> 01:48:32,763
And when you gone,

1377
01:48:32,829 --> 01:48:34,765
you stay gone,

1378
01:48:34,831 --> 01:48:37,769
- or you be gone.

1379
01:48:37,834 --> 01:48:40,772
You lost all your L.A. privileges.
Deal?

1380
01:48:42,606 --> 01:48:44,542
Deal.

1381
01:48:45,776 --> 01:48:47,712
Get your ass outta here.

1382
01:49:14,170 --> 01:49:16,422
Oh, shit.

1383
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:51,857
Fabienne!

1384
01:49:52,924 --> 01:49:55,862
Fabienne!

1385
01:49:57,095 --> 01:49:59,190
Fabienne!
Come on, baby.

1386
01:49:59,264 --> 01:50:02,700
- Come on. Get your shit.
We gotta go right now. - I was so worried.

1387
01:50:02,701 --> 01:50:06,273
- What about our bags?
- Fuck the bags; if we don't split right now, we'll miss the train.

1388
01:50:06,274 --> 01:50:08,274
- I'll be downstairs.
- Is everything well?

1389
01:50:08,275 --> 01:50:12,213
- Just come on! No talking now!
- Are we in danger?

1390
01:50:15,714 --> 01:50:17,650
Come on, honey!

1391
01:50:19,718 --> 01:50:22,188
Where did you get
this motorcycle?

1392
01:50:22,254 --> 01:50:26,787
- It's not a motorcycle, baby. It's a chopper.
Let's go. - What happened to my Honda?

1393
01:50:26,858 --> 01:50:30,628
I'm sorry, baby, I had to crash that Honda.
Will you come on now, please?

1394
01:50:30,695 --> 01:50:33,097
Come on. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

1395
01:50:37,669 --> 01:50:41,108
- You're hurt?
- No, no, I might've broken my nose. It's no biggie.

1396
01:50:41,173 --> 01:50:44,111
Come on. Hop on.
Baby, please, we-

1397
01:50:44,176 --> 01:50:47,114
Honey, we gotta hit
the fuckin' road! Get on!

1398
01:50:48,780 --> 01:50:52,219
- Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
Come here, come here. -

1399
01:50:52,284 --> 01:50:54,220
I'm sorry. Mmm.

1400
01:50:54,286 --> 01:50:58,226
- I'm so sorry.
- You were gone so long, I started to think dreadful thoughts.

1401
01:50:58,290 --> 01:51:01,228
I didn't mean to worry you.
Everything's fine.

1402
01:51:01,293 --> 01:51:03,229
- How was your breakfast?
- It was good.

1403
01:51:03,295 --> 01:51:05,231
Did you get
the blueberry pancakes?

1404
01:51:05,297 --> 01:51:09,237
They didn't have blueberry; I had to get
buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay?

1405
01:51:09,301 --> 01:51:12,238
Since I left you,
this has been, without a doubt,

1406
01:51:12,239 --> 01:51:15,610
the single weirdest fuckin' day
of my life-I'll tell you all about it.

1407
01:51:15,611 --> 01:51:17,474
Gotta go. Come on.

1408
01:51:17,543 --> 01:51:20,309
Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

1409
01:51:20,378 --> 01:51:22,975
- It's a chopper, baby.
- Whose chopper is this?

1410
01:51:23,048 --> 01:51:24,984
- Zed's.
- Who's Zed?

1411
01:51:25,050 --> 01:51:27,613
Zed's dead, baby.
Zed's dead.

1412
01:51:43,803 --> 01:51:46,103
Yes, you did, Brett!

1413
01:51:46,171 --> 01:51:49,702
You tried to fuck him, and Marsellus
Wallace don't liked to be fucked...

1414
01:51:49,775 --> 01:51:52,211
by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

1415
01:51:52,277 --> 01:51:55,410
- Oh, God, please. I don't wanna die.
- You read the Bible, Brett?

1416
01:51:55,447 --> 01:51:58,887
-  Yes!
- Well, there's this passage I got memorized.

1417
01:51:58,951 --> 01:52:01,114
Sorta fits the occasion.

1418
01:52:01,186 --> 01:52:04,488
Ezekiel 25:17.

1419
01:52:04,557 --> 01:52:08,861
<i>"The path of the righteous man</i>
<i>is beset on all sides...</i>

1420
01:52:08,928 --> 01:52:10,864
<i>by the inequities</i>
<i>of the selfish...</i>

1421
01:52:10,930 --> 01:52:14,369
<i>- and the tyranny of evil men.</i>

1422
01:52:14,432 --> 01:52:19,101
<i>Blessed is he who, in the name</i>
<i>of charity and good will,</i>

1423
01:52:19,170 --> 01:52:22,199
<i>shepherds the weak</i>
<i>through the valley of darkness,</i>

1424
01:52:22,274 --> 01:52:24,802
<i>for he is truly</i>
<i>his brother's keeper...</i>

1425
01:52:24,877 --> 01:52:27,610
<i>and the finder of lost children.</i>

1426
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:31,950
<i>And I will strike down upon thee</i>
<i>with great vengeance...</i>

1427
01:52:32,018 --> 01:52:34,181
<i>and furious anger...</i>

1428
01:52:34,252 --> 01:52:38,660
<i>those who attempt to poison</i>
<i>and destroy My brothers.</i>

1429
01:52:38,724 --> 01:52:42,596
<i>And you will know</i>
<i>My name is the Lord...</i>

1430
01:52:42,662 --> 01:52:46,066
<i>when I lay My vengeance</i>
<i>upon thee."</i>

1431
01:52:54,140 --> 01:52:56,577
I'm fucked.
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1432
01:52:56,642 --> 01:52:59,580
-  ls he a friend of yours?
- Oh, goddamn. Goddamn.

1433
01:52:59,645 --> 01:53:02,580
Hmm? Oh.
Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.

1434
01:53:02,581 --> 01:53:05,653
- Better tell him to shut up. He's gettin'
on my nerves. - Fuck.

1435
01:53:05,654 --> 01:53:08,851
Marvin. Marvin!
I'd knock that shit off if I was you.

1436
01:53:08,921 --> 01:53:13,089
- Die, you motherfuckers! Die!

1437
01:53:41,253 --> 01:53:44,693
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
somebody was in the bathroom?

1438
01:53:44,757 --> 01:53:47,627
Slip your mind? Did you forget
that someone was in there...

1439
01:53:47,693 --> 01:53:49,629
with a goddamn hand cannon?

1440
01:53:49,695 --> 01:53:53,635
You see the size of that gun he fired
at us? It was bigger than him.

1441
01:53:58,404 --> 01:54:01,103
We should be fuckin' dead, man.

1442
01:54:01,173 --> 01:54:03,109
I know.
We was lucky.

1443
01:54:03,175 --> 01:54:06,306
No, no, no, no.
That shit wasn't luck.

1444
01:54:06,379 --> 01:54:10,582
- Yeah, maybe.
- This was divine intervention.

1445
01:54:10,650 --> 01:54:12,642
You know what
divine intervention is?

1446
01:54:18,457 --> 01:54:20,393
I think so.

1447
01:54:20,459 --> 01:54:23,899
That means that God came down
from Heaven and stopped the bullets.

1448
01:54:23,963 --> 01:54:26,399
That's right.
That's exactly what it means.

1449
01:54:26,465 --> 01:54:29,899
God came down from Heaven
and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.

1450
01:54:30,670 --> 01:54:32,663
I think it's time for us
to leave, Jules.

1451
01:54:32,739 --> 01:54:35,175
Don't do that.
Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!

1452
01:54:35,241 --> 01:54:39,181
- What just happened here was a fuckin'
miracle! - Chill. This shit happens.

1453
01:54:39,245 --> 01:54:42,012
Wrong! Wrong.
This shit doesn't "just happen."

1454
01:54:42,081 --> 01:54:45,521
Do you want to continue
this theological discussion in a car...

1455
01:54:45,585 --> 01:54:48,021
or in a jailhouse with the cops?

1456
01:54:48,087 --> 01:54:50,718
We should be fuckin' dead,
my friend!

1457
01:54:50,791 --> 01:54:55,027
What happened here was a miracle, and I
want you to fucking acknowledge it!

1458
01:54:55,094 --> 01:54:59,798
All right, it was a miracle.
Can we go now?

1459
01:55:06,807 --> 01:55:10,173
Let's go, nigger!
Come on! Shit.

1460
01:55:10,174 --> 01:55:13,921
You ever seen that show Cops?

1461
01:55:13,922 --> 01:55:16,859
I was watching it one time,
and there was this cop on,

1462
01:55:16,860 --> 01:55:20,931
and he was talkin' about this gunfight
he had in the hallway with this guy, right?

1463
01:55:20,932 --> 01:55:24,468
He just unloaded on this guy and nothin'
happened. He didn't hit nothin'.

1464
01:55:24,469 --> 01:55:27,403
Okay? It was just
him and this guy.

1465
01:55:27,468 --> 01:55:30,805
I mean, you know, it's,
it's freaky, but it happens.

1466
01:55:30,872 --> 01:55:35,814
You wanna play blind man, go walk with the
shepherd, but me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.

1467
01:55:35,877 --> 01:55:38,815
- What the fuck does that mean?
- It means that's it for me.

1468
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:41,579
From here on in, you can
consider my ass retired.

1469
01:55:41,650 --> 01:55:43,882
- Jesus Christ. Goddamn it.
- Don't blaspheme.

1470
01:55:43,883 --> 01:55:47,023
- I said, don't do that!
- Hey, why are you fuckin' freakin' out on us?

1471
01:55:47,024 --> 01:55:50,084
Look, I'm tellin' Marsellus today-
I'm through.

1472
01:55:50,085 --> 01:55:53,162
- Why don't you tell him at the same
time why? - Don't worry, I will.

1473
01:55:53,163 --> 01:55:57,158
- And I bet you $10,000 he laughs his ass off.
- I don't give a damn if he does.

1474
01:55:57,232 --> 01:56:00,329
Marvin, what do you make of all this?

1475
01:56:00,401 --> 01:56:02,838
Man, I don't even
have an opinion.

1476
01:56:02,904 --> 01:56:07,139
You gotta have an opinion. You think
God came down from Heaven and stopped-

1477
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:09,278
- What the fuck's happenin'?

1478
01:56:09,279 --> 01:56:11,211
- Aw, shit, man!
- Aw, man!

1479
01:56:11,212 --> 01:56:14,283
- Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.
- Why the fuck'd you do that?

1480
01:56:14,284 --> 01:56:16,218
I didn't mean it.
It was an accident.

1481
01:56:16,219 --> 01:56:19,288
- Man, I seen some crazy-ass
shit in my time, but this... Chill out, man!

1482
01:56:19,289 --> 01:56:22,291
It was an accident. We probably
went over a bump or somethin'.

1483
01:56:22,292 --> 01:56:24,293
The car ain't hit
no motherfuckin' bump.

1484
01:56:24,294 --> 01:56:27,628
I didn't mean to shoot
the son of a bitch. The gun went off.

1485
01:56:27,629 --> 01:56:31,200
Look at this fuckin' mess! We're on
a city street in broad daylight here!

1486
01:56:31,201 --> 01:56:34,203
- I don't believe it!
- Well, believe it now, motherfucker!

1487
01:56:34,204 --> 01:56:37,738
We gotta get this car off the road. Cops
notice shit like a car drenched in blood.

1488
01:56:37,739 --> 01:56:40,744
- Just take it to a friendly place,
that's all! - This is the Valley, Vincent.

1489
01:56:40,745 --> 01:56:43,246
Marsellus ain't got
no friendly places in the Valley.

1490
01:56:43,247 --> 01:56:46,183
- Well, Jules, this ain't
my fuckin' town, man! - Shit!

1491
01:56:46,248 --> 01:56:49,186
- What you doing?
- I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.

1492
01:56:49,251 --> 01:56:52,781
- Where's Toluca Lake?
- Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.

1493
01:56:52,782 --> 01:56:55,858
If Jimmie's ass ain't home,
I don't know what the fuck we gonna do,

1494
01:56:55,859 --> 01:56:58,795
'cause I ain't got
no other partners in 818.

1495
01:56:58,860 --> 01:57:01,813
Jimmie, how you doin', man?
It's Jules. Just listen up, man.

1496
01:57:01,863 --> 01:57:05,803
Me and my homeboy are in a car, and we
gotta get it off the road, pronto.

1497
01:57:05,867 --> 01:57:08,064
I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.

1498
01:57:08,065 --> 01:57:12,574
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie situation.

1499
01:57:12,575 --> 01:57:16,203
He's one remark away
from kickin' our asses out the door.

1500
01:57:16,204 --> 01:57:19,283
- If he does, what do we do?
- We ain't leavin' 'til we make a couple calls,

1501
01:57:19,284 --> 01:57:22,218
but I don't want it to reach
that pitch-Jimmie's a friend.

1502
01:57:22,219 --> 01:57:25,288
You don't come into your friend's house
and start tellin' him what's what.

1503
01:57:25,289 --> 01:57:27,221
Just tell him not to be abusive.

1504
01:57:27,222 --> 01:57:29,292
He kinda freaked out back there
when he saw Marvin.

1505
01:57:29,293 --> 01:57:32,529
Put yourself in his position-
It's 8:00 in the morning, he just woke up.

1506
01:57:32,530 --> 01:57:34,463
He wasn't expectin' this shit.

1507
01:57:34,530 --> 01:57:37,466
We gotta remember here
who's doin' who a favor.

1508
01:57:37,467 --> 01:57:41,539
If that favor means I gotta take shit, he
can stick that favor straight up his ass.

1509
01:57:41,540 --> 01:57:45,543
- Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd you just do
to his towel, man? - I was dryin' my hands!

1510
01:57:45,544 --> 01:57:48,545
- You're supposed to wash 'em first!
- You watched me wash 'em.

1511
01:57:48,546 --> 01:57:52,107
- I watched you get 'em wet.
- I was washin' 'em. This shit's hard to get off.

1512
01:57:52,108 --> 01:57:54,183
Maybe if he'd had Lava
I coulda done a better job.

1513
01:57:54,184 --> 01:57:56,118
I used the same
fuckin' soap you did,

1514
01:57:56,119 --> 01:57:59,188
and when I finished, the towel
didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad!

1515
01:57:59,189 --> 01:58:02,125
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this?

1516
01:58:02,190 --> 01:58:06,290
It's shit like this that's gonna bring
this situation to a head, man!

1517
01:58:06,361 --> 01:58:09,801
Look, I ain't threatenin' you
or nothin', all right?

1518
01:58:09,866 --> 01:58:14,330
You know I respect you and all. But just
don't put me in this position, all right?

1519
01:58:14,402 --> 01:58:17,101
All right.
Fine. Fine.

1520
01:58:17,172 --> 01:58:20,110
Ask me nice like that,
no problem.

1521
01:58:20,175 --> 01:58:23,113
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.

1522
01:58:24,847 --> 01:58:27,717
Mmm! Goddamn, Jimmie!

1523
01:58:27,784 --> 01:58:29,879
This some serious gourmet shit.

1524
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:31,955
Me and Vincent
would've been satisfied...

1525
01:58:31,956 --> 01:58:33,991
with some freeze-dried
Taster's Choice.

1526
01:58:33,992 --> 01:58:35,926
Right?

1527
01:58:35,992 --> 01:58:38,929
And he springs this
serious gourmet shit on us.

1528
01:58:38,930 --> 01:58:41,131
- What flavor is this?
- Knock it off, Julie.

1529
01:58:41,132 --> 01:58:45,161
- What?
- I don't need you to tell me how fuckin' good my coffee is.

1530
01:58:45,234 --> 01:58:47,727
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

1531
01:58:47,728 --> 01:58:49,807
When Bonnie goes shopping,
she buys shit.

1532
01:58:49,808 --> 01:58:53,479
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.

1533
01:58:53,508 --> 01:58:57,448
But you know what's on my mind right
now? It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.

1534
01:58:57,513 --> 01:58:59,676
It's the dead nigger
in my garage.

1535
01:58:59,677 --> 01:59:03,253
- Jimmie, don't even worry- - Don't tell me
about anything. I wanna ask you a question.

1536
01:59:03,254 --> 01:59:05,188
When you came pulling in here,

1537
01:59:05,189 --> 01:59:08,526
did you notice the sign on the front of my
house that said, "Dead Nigger Storage"?

1538
01:59:08,527 --> 01:59:12,029
- You know I ain't seen no- - Did you
notice the sign on the front of my house...

1539
01:59:12,030 --> 01:59:13,964
that said,
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

1540
01:59:14,030 --> 01:59:16,763
No. I didn't.

1541
01:59:16,833 --> 01:59:19,770
- You know why you didn't
see that sign? -  Why?

1542
01:59:19,771 --> 01:59:24,442
'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing dead
niggers ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!

1543
01:59:24,443 --> 01:59:27,444
- We're not gonna store the motherfucker...
Don't you fuckin' realize...

1544
01:59:27,445 --> 01:59:31,883
that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead
body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced?

1545
01:59:31,884 --> 01:59:35,253
No marriage counselor. No trial separation.
I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.

1546
01:59:35,254 --> 01:59:38,622
Okay? And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced!

1547
01:59:38,688 --> 01:59:43,685
Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you,
but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.

1548
01:59:43,686 --> 01:59:45,929
Jimmie, Jimmie,
she ain't gonna leave you.

1549
01:59:45,930 --> 01:59:49,868
Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules!
Okay? Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me.

1550
01:59:49,932 --> 01:59:54,206
There's nothin' you're gonna say that's gonna
make me forget I love my wife. Is there?

1551
01:59:57,039 --> 02:00:01,708
Now, look, you know, she comes home
from work in about an hour and a half.

1552
02:00:01,777 --> 02:00:04,840
The graveyard shift
at the hospital.

1553
02:00:04,914 --> 02:00:07,987
You gotta make some phone calls?
You gotta call some people?

1554
02:00:08,050 --> 02:00:11,990
Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck
out of my house before she gets here.

1555
02:00:12,054 --> 02:00:14,992
That's Kool and the Gang.
We don't wanna fuck your shit up.

1556
02:00:15,057 --> 02:00:18,029
All I wanna do is call my people
and get 'em to bring us in.

1557
02:00:18,094 --> 02:00:21,032
You're fucking my shit up
right now!

1558
02:00:21,097 --> 02:00:24,193
You're gonna fuck my shit up
big time if Bonnie comes home.

1559
02:00:24,194 --> 02:00:27,840
Do me that favor, all right? The phone
is in my bedroom. I suggest you get going.

1560
02:00:27,841 --> 02:00:30,775
Well, say she comes home.

1561
02:00:30,841 --> 02:00:33,277
What do you think she'll do?

1562
02:00:34,778 --> 02:00:37,214
Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.

1563
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:39,477
That ain't no kinda answer.

1564
02:00:39,549 --> 02:00:42,612
I mean, you know, I don't.
How much? A lot or a little?

1565
02:00:42,686 --> 02:00:45,556
You got to appreciate
what an explosive element...

1566
02:00:45,622 --> 02:00:47,558
this Bonnie situation is.

1567
02:00:47,624 --> 02:00:51,598
She comes home from a hard day's work, finds
a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen...

1568
02:00:51,628 --> 02:00:53,564
doing a bunch of gangster shit,

1569
02:00:53,630 --> 02:00:56,693
there ain't no tellin'
what she's liable to do.

1570
02:00:58,869 --> 02:01:00,805
Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.

1571
02:01:00,871 --> 02:01:03,467
All I'm doing is
contemplating the ifs.

1572
02:01:03,540 --> 02:01:06,476
I don't wanna hear about
no motherfuckin' ifs!

1573
02:01:06,477 --> 02:01:10,549
All I want to hear from your ass is, "You ain't
got no problem, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker.

1574
02:01:10,550 --> 02:01:14,715
Chill them niggers out and wait for the
cavalry, which should be coming directly."

1575
02:01:14,784 --> 02:01:17,951
You ain't got no problem, Jules.

1576
02:01:18,021 --> 02:01:20,150
I'm on the motherfucker.

1577
02:01:20,222 --> 02:01:25,290
Chill them niggers out and wait for
the Wolf, who should be coming directly.

1578
02:01:25,361 --> 02:01:27,799
You sendin' the Wolf?

1579
02:01:27,864 --> 02:01:30,061
Oh, you feel better,
motherfucker?

1580
02:01:30,133 --> 02:01:32,399
Shit, yeah, negro!

1581
02:01:32,468 --> 02:01:35,600
That's all you had to say!

1582
02:01:35,672 --> 02:01:38,872
-  She the hysterical type?

1583
02:01:38,942 --> 02:01:41,880
- When is she due?

1584
02:01:41,945 --> 02:01:44,040
Mm-hmm.

1585
02:01:44,114 --> 02:01:46,050
Give me
the principals' names again.

1586
02:01:46,116 --> 02:01:48,052
Place your bets.

1587
02:01:49,119 --> 02:01:52,786
- Jules. Mm-hmm.
- Cards, please.

1588
02:01:52,856 --> 02:01:54,792
Vincent.

1589
02:01:59,529 --> 02:02:01,464
Jimmie.

1590
02:02:02,699 --> 02:02:04,828
Bonnie. Mm-hmm.

1591
02:02:10,240 --> 02:02:13,340
It's thirty minutes away.
I'll be there in ten.

1592
02:02:30,154 --> 02:02:33,092
You're... Jimmie, right?
This is your house?

1593
02:02:33,157 --> 02:02:36,790
- It sure is.
- I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.

1594
02:02:36,861 --> 02:02:39,799
- Good. We got one.
- So I heard. May I come in?

1595
02:02:39,864 --> 02:02:41,800
Uh, yeah. Please do.

1596
02:02:41,866 --> 02:02:45,533
You must be Jules.
Which would make you... Vincent.

1597
02:02:45,603 --> 02:02:48,039
Let's get down
to brass tacks, gentlemen.

1598
02:02:48,040 --> 02:02:51,110
If I was informed correctly, the clock
is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie?

1599
02:02:51,111 --> 02:02:53,044
Uh, one hundred percent.

1600
02:02:53,110 --> 02:02:57,050
- Your wife Bonnie comes home
at 9:30 in the a.m., correct? - Uh-huh.

1601
02:02:57,114 --> 02:03:01,613
I was led to believe if she comes home and finds
us here, she wouldn't appreciate it much.

1602
02:03:01,685 --> 02:03:05,989
- She wouldn't at that.
- That gives us 40 minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge,

1603
02:03:06,057 --> 02:03:09,496
which, if you do what I say,
when I say it, should be plenty.

1604
02:03:09,561 --> 02:03:13,899
Now, you got a corpse in a car,
minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it.

1605
02:03:21,640 --> 02:03:23,576
- Jimmie.
- Uh-huh.

1606
02:03:23,642 --> 02:03:27,081
Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee back there.

1607
02:03:27,144 --> 02:03:30,584
- Would you make me a cup?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

1608
02:03:32,049 --> 02:03:34,987
Oh, uh, um, how do you take it?

1609
02:03:35,052 --> 02:03:37,615
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

1610
02:03:39,691 --> 02:03:43,130
About the car, is there anything
I need to know? Does it stall?

1611
02:03:43,194 --> 02:03:46,634
Does it smoke? Does it make
a lot of noise? ls there gas in it?

1612
02:03:46,698 --> 02:03:50,137
- Aside from how it looks,
the car's cool. - Positive?

1613
02:03:50,201 --> 02:03:53,641
Don't get me on the road and I find out
the brake lights don't work.

1614
02:03:53,705 --> 02:03:57,770
- As far as I know,
the motherfucker's tip-top. - Good enough.

1615
02:03:57,843 --> 02:03:59,870
Let's go back to the kitchen.

1616
02:04:05,517 --> 02:04:08,454
- Here you go, Mr. Wolf.
- Thank you, Jimmie.

1617
02:04:13,290 --> 02:04:15,226
Mmm.

1618
02:04:16,293 --> 02:04:18,422
Okay, first thing.
You two.

1619
02:04:18,496 --> 02:04:21,434
Take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

1620
02:04:21,499 --> 02:04:24,232
This looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

1621
02:04:24,301 --> 02:04:28,241
- That would lead me to believe you got
cleansers and shit. - Yeah. Under the sink.

1622
02:04:28,305 --> 02:04:31,745
Good. What I need you two fellas to do
is take those cleaning products...

1623
02:04:31,810 --> 02:04:35,841
and clean the inside of the car-
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

1624
02:04:35,914 --> 02:04:39,854
Go in the back seat, scoop up all
those little pieces of brain and skull.

1625
02:04:39,918 --> 02:04:42,855
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

1626
02:04:42,856 --> 02:04:45,925
It don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.

1627
02:04:45,926 --> 02:04:50,297
Just give it a good once-over. What you need
to take care of are the really messy parts.

1628
02:04:50,361 --> 02:04:54,461
The pools of blood that have collected,
you gotta soak that shit up.

1629
02:04:54,533 --> 02:04:56,969
We need to raid
your linen closet.

1630
02:04:57,035 --> 02:04:59,973
I need blankets,
I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.

1631
02:05:00,038 --> 02:05:03,671
The thicker the better, the darker the
better. No whites. Can't use 'em.

1632
02:05:03,742 --> 02:05:09,049
We'll need to camouflage the front seat
and back seat and floorboards...

1633
02:05:09,114 --> 02:05:11,050
with quilts and blankets,

1634
02:05:11,116 --> 02:05:15,090
so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout
in the car, the subterfuge won't last,

1635
02:05:15,120 --> 02:05:17,990
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.

1636
02:05:18,056 --> 02:05:20,117
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

1637
02:05:20,192 --> 02:05:21,957
"Please" would be nice.

1638
02:05:23,428 --> 02:05:26,366
- Come again?
- I said, a "please" would be nice.

1639
02:05:28,266 --> 02:05:32,240
Get it straight, buster. I'm not here to say
please. I'm here to tell you what to do.

1640
02:05:33,905 --> 02:05:36,843
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess,

1641
02:05:36,908 --> 02:05:39,344
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.

1642
02:05:39,411 --> 02:05:43,316
I'm here to help. If my help's
not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1643
02:05:43,317 --> 02:05:46,787
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;
your help is definitely appreciated.

1644
02:05:46,788 --> 02:05:49,789
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't
mean disrespect, okay? I respect you.

1645
02:05:49,790 --> 02:05:52,589
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me.

1646
02:05:52,657 --> 02:05:55,720
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

1647
02:05:55,794 --> 02:06:00,428
I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys
to act fast if you wanna get out of this.

1648
02:06:00,498 --> 02:06:03,938
So pretty please, with sugar on top,
clean the fuckin' car.

1649
02:06:08,440 --> 02:06:12,107
Don't be lookin' at me like that,
all right? I can feel your look.

1650
02:06:14,813 --> 02:06:17,512
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

1651
02:06:19,585 --> 02:06:21,521
Green.

1652
02:06:23,121 --> 02:06:26,059
Nothin' except for
the mess inside.

1653
02:06:28,260 --> 02:06:30,697
Mmm, about 20 minutes.

1654
02:06:32,197 --> 02:06:34,133
Nobody who'll be missed.

1655
02:06:36,201 --> 02:06:39,139
You're a good man, Joe.
Thanks a bunch.

1656
02:06:40,238 --> 02:06:42,174
- How we comin', Jimmie?
- Pretty good.

1657
02:06:42,240 --> 02:06:45,403
- I got it all here, but, uh,

1658
02:06:45,404 --> 02:06:48,983
- Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something.
- Winston, Jimmie, Winston.

1659
02:06:48,984 --> 02:06:52,511
Okay. You gotta
understand something, uh, Winston.

1660
02:06:52,585 --> 02:06:54,521
Uh-Uh, no,
thank you.

1661
02:06:54,587 --> 02:06:57,718
Uh, this is our best linen here,

1662
02:06:57,790 --> 02:07:00,728
and it's, uh-
it was a wedding present...

1663
02:07:00,793 --> 02:07:03,229
from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny.

1664
02:07:03,295 --> 02:07:07,737
- They're not with us anymore.
I wanna help... Let me ask you a question.

1665
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:10,738
- If you don't mind.
- No, no, please. Go ahead.

1666
02:07:12,304 --> 02:07:17,212
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny,
were they millionaires?

1667
02:07:18,343 --> 02:07:20,279
No.

1668
02:07:20,345 --> 02:07:22,782
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.

1669
02:07:22,848 --> 02:07:26,309
And I'm positive that if
Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

1670
02:07:26,384 --> 02:07:28,821
- Ginny.
- Ginny were here,

1671
02:07:28,888 --> 02:07:33,158
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set,

1672
02:07:33,224 --> 02:07:36,355
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

1673
02:07:40,332 --> 02:07:44,272
I like oak myself.
That's what I have in my bedroom.

1674
02:07:45,403 --> 02:07:47,339
How about you, Jimmie?

1675
02:07:48,574 --> 02:07:50,509
You an oak man?

1676
02:07:51,610 --> 02:07:53,546
Oak's nice.

1677
02:07:59,384 --> 02:08:03,256
Oh, man, I will never
forgive your ass for this shit.

1678
02:08:03,321 --> 02:08:05,758
This is some fucked-up,
repugnant shit.

1679
02:08:05,759 --> 02:08:09,329
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits he is wrong...

1680
02:08:09,330 --> 02:08:12,266
that he is immediately forgiven
for all wrongdoings?

1681
02:08:12,331 --> 02:08:15,266
Get the fuck out my face
with that shit!

1682
02:08:15,267 --> 02:08:18,272
The motherfucker that said that shit never
had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull...

1683
02:08:18,273 --> 02:08:22,110
- on account of your dumb ass.
- I got a threshold, Jules, for the abuse that I will take.

1684
02:08:22,111 --> 02:08:25,706
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,
and you got me in the red.

1685
02:08:25,707 --> 02:08:29,283
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous
to have a race car in the fuckin' red.

1686
02:08:29,284 --> 02:08:31,217
That's all.
I could blow.

1687
02:08:31,283 --> 02:08:33,219
- Oh, you ready to blow?
- Yeah.

1688
02:08:33,220 --> 02:08:36,289
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'
motherfucker, motherfucker.

1689
02:08:36,290 --> 02:08:39,226
Every time my fingers touch brain,
I'm Superfly T.N.T.

1690
02:08:39,291 --> 02:08:41,227
I'm the Guns of the Navarone.

1691
02:08:41,293 --> 02:08:44,230
In fact, what the fuck
am I doin' in the back?

1692
02:08:44,231 --> 02:08:47,602
You're the motherfucker should be on
brain detail! We're fuckin' switchin'.

1693
02:08:47,603 --> 02:08:50,913
I'm washin' windows, and you're
pickin' up this nigger's skull!

1694
02:08:59,812 --> 02:09:01,748
Fine job, gentlemen.

1695
02:09:03,082 --> 02:09:05,519
You may get out of this yet.

1696
02:09:05,585 --> 02:09:08,021
I can't believe
this is the same car.

1697
02:09:08,087 --> 02:09:11,526
Well, let's not start suckin'
each other's dicks quite yet.

1698
02:09:11,527 --> 02:09:15,097
Phase one is complete-Clean the car-
which moves us right along to Phase two:

1699
02:09:15,098 --> 02:09:17,030
Clean you two.

1700
02:09:18,598 --> 02:09:20,464
Strip.

1701
02:09:20,534 --> 02:09:24,303
- All the way?
-  To your bare ass.

1702
02:09:24,370 --> 02:09:27,466
Quickly, gentlemen.
We got about 15 minutes...

1703
02:09:27,467 --> 02:09:30,545
before Jimmie's better half
comes pulling into the driveway.

1704
02:09:30,546 --> 02:09:33,036
Goddamn, this morning air
is some chilly shit.

1705
02:09:33,037 --> 02:09:35,200
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?

1706
02:09:35,201 --> 02:09:37,570
- You know what you two look like?
-  What?

1707
02:09:37,571 --> 02:09:41,008
Like a couple of guys
who just blew off somebody's head.

1708
02:09:41,071 --> 02:09:44,441
Strippin' off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

1709
02:09:48,747 --> 02:09:51,217
Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.

1710
02:09:51,281 --> 02:09:55,723
Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this
shit out front for the garbageman to pick up.

1711
02:09:55,787 --> 02:10:00,023
Don't worry, we're taking it with us.
Jim, the soap.

1712
02:10:01,458 --> 02:10:03,394
- Vincent.
-  Okay, gentlemen.

1713
02:10:03,460 --> 02:10:06,956
You both been to County before,
I'm sure. Here it comes.

1714
02:10:07,030 --> 02:10:09,968
- Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!
- Yo! Yo! Yo!

1715
02:10:10,033 --> 02:10:13,264
Better you than me, gentlemen.

1716
02:10:13,265 --> 02:10:16,341
- Don't be afraid of the soap.
Spread it around. -

1717
02:10:16,342 --> 02:10:19,277
- Get 'em there a little bit.
Vincent's hair. - Hey, get out of my hair!

1718
02:10:19,278 --> 02:10:22,180
- Come on. Do it, goddamn it! Do it!
- Uh, um-

1719
02:10:23,247 --> 02:10:25,183
Towel.

1720
02:10:35,693 --> 02:10:38,859
You're dry enough.
Toss 'em their clothes.

1721
02:10:38,930 --> 02:10:42,198
Perfect.

1722
02:10:42,266 --> 02:10:45,728
Perfect. We couldn't have
planned this better.

1723
02:10:45,804 --> 02:10:47,740
You guys look like-

1724
02:10:47,806 --> 02:10:50,242
What do they look like, Jimmie?

1725
02:10:50,307 --> 02:10:53,906
- Dorks. They look like
a couple of dorks. -

1726
02:10:53,978 --> 02:10:57,472
-  - Ha-ha-ha.
They're your clothes, motherfucker.

1727
02:10:57,473 --> 02:11:00,352
Come on, gentlemen.
We're laughing our way right into prison.

1728
02:11:00,353 --> 02:11:02,286
Don't make me beg.

1729
02:11:05,355 --> 02:11:08,795
Okay, gentlemen, let's get
our rules of the road straight.

1730
02:11:08,860 --> 02:11:12,423
We're going to a place
called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

1731
02:11:12,424 --> 02:11:15,500
Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

1732
02:11:15,501 --> 02:11:17,401
The place is North Hollywood,

1733
02:11:17,467 --> 02:11:21,464
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.

1734
02:11:21,539 --> 02:11:24,875
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

1735
02:11:26,277 --> 02:11:28,213
Vincent, you follow in my Acura.

1736
02:11:28,279 --> 02:11:32,219
Now, if we come across the path
of any John Q. Laws,

1737
02:11:32,283 --> 02:11:35,380
- nobody does a fuckin' thing
'til I do something. - Right.

1738
02:11:35,453 --> 02:11:38,391
- What did I say?
- Don't do shit unless.

1739
02:11:38,456 --> 02:11:40,723
- Unless what?
- Unless you do it first.

1740
02:11:40,792 --> 02:11:43,226
Spoken like a true prodigy.

1741
02:11:43,227 --> 02:11:46,801
How about you, Lash LaRue? Can you
keep your spurs from jingling and jangling?

1742
02:11:46,802 --> 02:11:50,898
The gun went off. I don't know why.
I'm cool. I promise you.

1743
02:11:50,969 --> 02:11:53,907
Fair enough. Now, I drive real
fuckin' fast, so keep up.

1744
02:11:53,972 --> 02:11:56,465
If get my car back
any different than I gave it,

1745
02:11:56,542 --> 02:11:59,479
Monster Joe's gonna be
disposing of two bodies.

1746
02:12:03,314 --> 02:12:05,011
Outta my way, Rex.

1747
02:12:06,585 --> 02:12:09,021
- We cool?
- Like it never happened.

1748
02:12:09,087 --> 02:12:12,857
-  All right.
- Boys, this is Raquel.

1749
02:12:12,924 --> 02:12:15,555
Someday all this will be hers.

1750
02:12:15,628 --> 02:12:18,497
Hi. So, what's
with the outfits?

1751
02:12:18,564 --> 02:12:22,003
- You guys going to a volleyball
game or something? -

1752
02:12:22,066 --> 02:12:24,502
I'm takin' milady
out for breakfast.

1753
02:12:24,570 --> 02:12:27,336
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?

1754
02:12:27,405 --> 02:12:28,772
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.

1755
02:12:28,840 --> 02:12:32,279
It's-
It's your future. I-

1756
02:12:32,343 --> 02:12:35,110
I see a-
a cab ride.

1757
02:12:35,179 --> 02:12:38,151
Move outta the sticks, fellas.
Say good night, Raquel.

1758
02:12:38,216 --> 02:12:41,154
- Good night, Raquel.
- I'll see you guys around.

1759
02:12:41,219 --> 02:12:43,656
Stay outta trouble,
you crazy kids.

1760
02:12:43,722 --> 02:12:47,662
Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was
a real pleasure watching you work.

1761
02:12:47,726 --> 02:12:50,664
Yeah, really.
And thank you very much, Mr. Wolf.

1762
02:12:50,729 --> 02:12:52,665
Call me Winston.

1763
02:12:54,232 --> 02:12:57,185
- You see that, young lady? Respect.

1764
02:12:57,235 --> 02:13:01,437
- Respect for one's elders
shows character. - I have character.

1765
02:13:01,506 --> 02:13:05,541
- Because you are a character doesn't mean
that you have character. -

1766
02:13:12,116 --> 02:13:15,054
- Wanna share a cab?

1767
02:13:15,119 --> 02:13:19,389
- I'd go for some breakfast. Feel like havin'
breakfast with me? -

1768
02:13:19,457 --> 02:13:22,258
Cool.

1769
02:13:26,297 --> 02:13:29,430
I don't know why, I just thought
he'd be European or something.

1770
02:13:29,467 --> 02:13:32,961
- Yeah, he's about as European
as fuckin' English Bob. - I know that now.

1771
02:13:32,972 --> 02:13:35,408
- But was he cool or what?
- Thank you.

1772
02:13:35,473 --> 02:13:37,910
Totally fuckin' cool,
in control.

1773
02:13:37,977 --> 02:13:42,042
Didn't even really get pissed when you
were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.

1774
02:13:42,114 --> 02:13:44,711
- Want some bacon?

1775
02:13:44,783 --> 02:13:46,717
No, man, I don't eat pork.

1776
02:13:46,718 --> 02:13:50,291
- Are you Jewish?
- I ain't Jewish; I just don't dig on swine, that's all.

1777
02:13:50,292 --> 02:13:53,226
- Why not?
- Pigs are filthy animals.

1778
02:13:53,291 --> 02:13:55,227
I don't eat filthy animals.

1779
02:13:55,293 --> 02:13:58,733
Yeah, but bacon tastes good.
Pork chops taste good.

1780
02:13:58,797 --> 02:14:01,735
Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie,
but I'd never know...

1781
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:04,738
'cause I wouldn't eat
the filthy motherfuckers.

1782
02:14:04,803 --> 02:14:07,741
Pigs sleep and root in shit.
That's a filthy animal.

1783
02:14:07,806 --> 02:14:11,746
I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got
sense enough to disregard its own feces.

1784
02:14:11,810 --> 02:14:16,148
- What about a dog? Dog eats its own
feces. - I don't eat dog either.

1785
02:14:16,215 --> 02:14:19,552
Yeah, but do you consider
a dog to be a filthy animal?

1786
02:14:19,618 --> 02:14:22,556
I wouldn't go so far
as to call a dog filthy,

1787
02:14:22,621 --> 02:14:24,555
but they're definitely dirty.

1788
02:14:24,556 --> 02:14:28,829
- But a dog's got personality. Personality goes a long way.
- Ah, so, by that rationale,

1789
02:14:28,830 --> 02:14:32,391
if a pig had a better personality,
he would cease to be a filthy animal.

1790
02:14:32,463 --> 02:14:36,403
- Is that true?
- We'd have to be talkin' about one charming motherfuckin' pig.

1791
02:14:36,467 --> 02:14:40,498
I mean, he'd have to be ten times more
charming than that Arnold on Green Acres.

1792
02:14:46,111 --> 02:14:48,240
Oh, man, that's good.

1793
02:14:48,313 --> 02:14:51,912
That's good, man.
You're startin' to lighten up.

1794
02:14:51,984 --> 02:14:54,978
You've been sittin' there,
all serious and shit.

1795
02:14:54,979 --> 02:14:57,558
- I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.
- About what?

1796
02:14:57,559 --> 02:15:00,494
- About the miracle we witnessed.
- Miracle you witnessed.

1797
02:15:00,560 --> 02:15:03,828
- I witnessed a freak occurrence.
- What is a miracle, Vincent?

1798
02:15:05,731 --> 02:15:08,931
- Act of God.
- And what's an act of God?

1799
02:15:12,404 --> 02:15:16,242
When, um, God makes
the impossible possible.

1800
02:15:17,276 --> 02:15:19,212
But this morning...

1801
02:15:19,278 --> 02:15:22,011
- I don't think qualifies.
- Hey, Vincent.

1802
02:15:22,081 --> 02:15:25,782
See, that shit don't matter.
You're judging this shit the wrong way.

1803
02:15:25,851 --> 02:15:30,793
It could be God stopped the bullets,
changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys.

1804
02:15:30,856 --> 02:15:33,851
You don't judge shit like this
based on merit.

1805
02:15:33,926 --> 02:15:36,362
Now, whether or not
what we experienced...

1806
02:15:36,428 --> 02:15:39,595
was an according-to-Hoyle miracle
is insignificant.

1807
02:15:39,666 --> 02:15:43,435
But what is significant is,
I felt the touch of God.

1808
02:15:43,502 --> 02:15:45,438
God got involved.

1809
02:15:45,504 --> 02:15:47,235
But why?

1810
02:15:47,306 --> 02:15:50,335
Well, that's what's fuckin' with me:
I don't know why.

1811
02:15:50,409 --> 02:15:53,380
- But I can't go back to sleep.
- You're serious.

1812
02:15:53,381 --> 02:15:55,448
You're really thinkin'
about quittin'.

1813
02:15:55,449 --> 02:15:58,112
- For life? Most definitely.
- Yeah.

1814
02:15:58,183 --> 02:16:01,554
Fuck.
What you gonna do then?

1815
02:16:02,856 --> 02:16:07,092
Well, that's what I been
sitting here contemplating.

1816
02:16:07,159 --> 02:16:10,758
First I'm gonna deliver
this case to Marsellus.

1817
02:16:10,830 --> 02:16:13,927
Then, basically, I'm just
gonna walk the Earth.

1818
02:16:13,999 --> 02:16:17,438
- What you mean, "walk the Earth"?
- Like Caine in Kung Fu.

1819
02:16:17,503 --> 02:16:20,475
Walk from place to place,
meet people, get in adventures.

1820
02:16:20,540 --> 02:16:22,806
And how long do you intend
to walk the Earth?

1821
02:16:22,876 --> 02:16:26,178
- 'Til God puts me where He wants me to be.
- What if He don't do that?

1822
02:16:26,245 --> 02:16:31,187
- If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever.
- So you decided to be a bum.

1823
02:16:31,250 --> 02:16:34,917
I'll just be Jules, Vincent.
No more, no less.

1824
02:16:34,988 --> 02:16:36,958
No, Jules,
you decided to be a bum,

1825
02:16:37,023 --> 02:16:40,325
just like all those pieces of shit
out there who beg for change,

1826
02:16:40,392 --> 02:16:43,330
who sleep in garbage bins,
eat what I throw away.

1827
02:16:43,395 --> 02:16:46,366
They got a name for that, Jules.
It's called a bum.

1828
02:16:46,367 --> 02:16:50,171
And without a job, a residence or legal
tender, that's what you're gonna be, man.

1829
02:16:50,172 --> 02:16:52,106
You're gonna be a fuckin' bum.

1830
02:16:52,172 --> 02:16:55,110
Look, my friend,
this is just where you and I differ.

1831
02:16:55,175 --> 02:16:58,011
Garcon! Coffee!

1832
02:16:58,077 --> 02:17:02,576
Jules, look, what happened this morning,
man, I agree it was peculiar.

1833
02:17:02,649 --> 02:17:05,779
- But water into wine, l-
- All shapes and sizes, Vincent.

1834
02:17:05,780 --> 02:17:09,023
- Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man.
- If my answers frighten you,

1835
02:17:09,024 --> 02:17:11,619
then you should cease
asking scary questions.

1836
02:17:14,493 --> 02:17:16,429
I'm gonna take a shit.

1837
02:17:19,299 --> 02:17:23,048
Let me ask you something.

1838
02:17:23,049 --> 02:17:25,385
When did you make this decision? When you
were sittin' there eatin' that muffin?

1839
02:17:25,386 --> 02:17:29,323
Yeah. I was sittin' here
eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee,

1840
02:17:29,388 --> 02:17:31,324
replayin' the incident
in my head,

1841
02:17:31,390 --> 02:17:35,194
when I had what alcoholics refer to
as a moment of clarity.

1842
02:17:35,260 --> 02:17:38,391
Fuck. To be continued.

1843
02:17:50,409 --> 02:17:53,347
- I love you, Pumpkin.
- I love you, Honey Bunny.

1844
02:17:53,348 --> 02:17:57,949
- Everybody be cool! This is a robbery!

1845
02:17:57,950 --> 02:18:02,947
Any one of you fucking pricks move, and I'll
execute every one of you motherfuckers!

1846
02:18:02,948 --> 02:18:06,494
- You got that? You just be quiet
over there! - Waitresses on the floor!

1847
02:18:06,495 --> 02:18:09,556
Get on the fuckin'-
Get the fuck down!

1848
02:18:09,628 --> 02:18:14,365
You're in a blind spot. Take your dames
over to that booth, on the count of ten!

1849
02:18:14,433 --> 02:18:19,000
- Mexicans, out of the fucking kitchen!
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8-

1850
02:18:19,071 --> 02:18:22,168
What the fuck are you doing,
you fucking yuppie? Get down!

1851
02:18:22,241 --> 02:18:24,712
- Get down!
- Throw those bags!

1852
02:18:24,777 --> 02:18:27,268
- Fucking move! Move!

1853
02:18:27,269 --> 02:18:29,683
- Move! Get the fuck-

1854
02:18:29,684 --> 02:18:32,711
Get down on the fucking floor!

1855
02:18:32,785 --> 02:18:34,721
Grandpa! Down!

1856
02:18:34,787 --> 02:18:38,157
I'm the manager here, and there's
no problem. No problem at all.

1857
02:18:38,223 --> 02:18:41,161
- You gonna give me a problem?
- No, sir, I'm not.

1858
02:18:41,226 --> 02:18:45,257
Thought you said you were gonna
give me a fucking problem!

1859
02:18:45,330 --> 02:18:50,034
- I think we got a hero here, Honey Bunny.
- Well, just execute him!

1860
02:18:50,102 --> 02:18:52,038
- I am not a hero.

1861
02:18:52,104 --> 02:18:55,133
- I'm just a coffee shop manager.
- Get the fuck down!

1862
02:18:55,207 --> 02:18:56,972
The restaurant's ours!

1863
02:18:57,042 --> 02:18:59,980
- Just take whatever you want.

1864
02:19:00,045 --> 02:19:01,981
- You talk to the customers.
- Yeah.

1865
02:19:02,047 --> 02:19:05,178
You tell them to be fucking cool
and everything will be over.

1866
02:19:05,250 --> 02:19:07,220
- You understand me?
- Yes!

1867
02:19:09,522 --> 02:19:11,320
Listen, everybody.

1868
02:19:11,390 --> 02:19:13,417
Be calm, cooperate,

1869
02:19:13,492 --> 02:19:16,430
and this'll all be over
in a minute!

1870
02:19:16,495 --> 02:19:18,465
Get the fuck down!
Well done.

1871
02:19:30,810 --> 02:19:34,303
All right, now, people, gonna
come around and collect your wallets!

1872
02:19:34,313 --> 02:19:37,775
You don't fucking talk. You just
throw 'em in the bag! Are we clear?

1873
02:19:37,851 --> 02:19:40,083
I said, are we fucking clear?

1874
02:19:40,152 --> 02:19:43,090
Good!
Now, wallets out!

1875
02:19:43,155 --> 02:19:46,753
That's it.
Get the fuck down. In the bag.

1876
02:19:46,754 --> 02:19:49,831
- In the fucking bag!
-  I don't have nothin' on me, man.

1877
02:19:49,832 --> 02:19:51,696
In the bag.

1878
02:19:51,764 --> 02:19:54,702
What am I waiting for?
In the fucking bag.

1879
02:19:54,767 --> 02:19:57,705
Laura. Laura. Tips.
In the bag.

1880
02:19:57,770 --> 02:20:00,002
- Is that a cellular phone?
- Yeah.

1881
02:20:00,073 --> 02:20:02,009
In the fucking bag.

1882
02:20:03,576 --> 02:20:07,037
Tidy up, tidy up, that's it.
Now get the fuck down on the floor.

1883
02:20:07,113 --> 02:20:09,550
In the bag.
In the bag.

1884
02:20:21,728 --> 02:20:23,664
In the bag.

1885
02:20:38,778 --> 02:20:41,715
- What's in the case?
- My boss's dirty laundry.

1886
02:20:41,716 --> 02:20:44,385
- Your boss makes you do his laundry?
- When he wants it clean.

1887
02:20:44,386 --> 02:20:47,155
- Sounds like a shit job.
- Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.

1888
02:20:47,156 --> 02:20:50,091
- Open it.
- 'Fraid I can't do that.

1889
02:20:52,125 --> 02:20:54,493
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes, you did.

1890
02:20:55,561 --> 02:20:57,895
What's going on?

1891
02:20:57,964 --> 02:21:01,424
- Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst.
- Shoot him in the face!

1892
02:21:01,425 --> 02:21:05,304
I hate to shatter your ego, but this ain't
the first time I've had a gun pointed at me.

1893
02:21:05,305 --> 02:21:08,776
- If you don't take your hand off that case,
it'll be your last. - Stop causing problems!

1894
02:21:08,777 --> 02:21:11,646
You'll get us all killed! Give 'em
what you got and get 'em outta here!

1895
02:21:11,647 --> 02:21:15,880
Shut the fuck up, fat man! This ain't
none of your goddamn business!

1896
02:21:15,949 --> 02:21:18,181
Be cool, Honey Bunny, be cool.

1897
02:21:18,251 --> 02:21:20,346
No problem.
I got it under control.

1898
02:21:21,921 --> 02:21:23,914
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

1899
02:21:25,526 --> 02:21:29,465
If you don't open that case,
I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.

1900
02:21:33,866 --> 02:21:35,802
We clear?

1901
02:21:38,938 --> 02:21:40,874
One.

1902
02:21:42,710 --> 02:21:45,237
Two.

1903
02:21:45,311 --> 02:21:47,372
- Three.
- Okay, Ringo.

1904
02:21:47,447 --> 02:21:49,508
You win.

1905
02:21:49,583 --> 02:21:51,519
It's yours.

1906
02:21:55,556 --> 02:21:58,288
- Open it.

1907
02:22:02,161 --> 02:22:04,393
Hey, what is it?

1908
02:22:04,464 --> 02:22:06,799
What is it?

1909
02:22:06,867 --> 02:22:09,463
Is that what I think it is?

1910
02:22:09,536 --> 02:22:12,234
Mm-hmm.

1911
02:22:13,807 --> 02:22:15,936
It's beautiful.

1912
02:22:16,009 --> 02:22:18,572
Goddamn it, what is it?

1913
02:22:20,046 --> 02:22:22,982
You let him go!
You let him go!

1914
02:22:22,983 --> 02:22:26,087
- Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!
- Tell that bitch to be cool.

1915
02:22:26,088 --> 02:22:29,089
- Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
Say, "Bitch, be cool!" - Be cool! Be cool!

1916
02:22:29,090 --> 02:22:31,893
- Tell that bitch to chill!
- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!

1917
02:22:31,894 --> 02:22:34,795
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

1918
02:22:34,796 --> 02:22:36,731
- Let go of him!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

1919
02:22:36,732 --> 02:22:39,667
- Now, promise her
it's gonna be all right! - I promise!

1920
02:22:39,668 --> 02:22:41,703
- Tell her to chill!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

1921
02:22:41,704 --> 02:22:43,638
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

1922
02:22:43,704 --> 02:22:47,197
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not
gonna do anything stupid, are we?

1923
02:22:47,206 --> 02:22:50,144
- Don't you hurt him!
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!

1924
02:22:50,145 --> 02:22:53,784
We're all gonna be like three little
Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like?

1925
02:22:53,785 --> 02:22:57,447
- Come on, Yolanda!
What's Fonzie like? - He's cool.

1926
02:22:57,518 --> 02:22:59,453
- What?
- Cool.

1927
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:02,355
Correctamundo.
And that's what we're gonna be.

1928
02:23:02,422 --> 02:23:04,358
We're gonna be cool.

1929
02:23:04,424 --> 02:23:09,332
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

1930
02:23:09,395 --> 02:23:11,490
And when I count three,

1931
02:23:11,565 --> 02:23:14,502
I want you to
let go of your gun,

1932
02:23:14,568 --> 02:23:18,029
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.

1933
02:23:19,106 --> 02:23:21,167
And when you do it,

1934
02:23:21,241 --> 02:23:23,302
you do it cool.

1935
02:23:23,376 --> 02:23:25,711
You ready?

1936
02:23:25,779 --> 02:23:27,874
One,

1937
02:23:27,948 --> 02:23:30,145
two,

1938
02:23:30,217 --> 02:23:32,153
three.

1939
02:23:39,126 --> 02:23:42,256
-  Okay, now you let him go!
- Yolanda!

1940
02:23:42,257 --> 02:23:46,001
I thought you were gonna be cool. Now,
when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.

1941
02:23:46,002 --> 02:23:48,094
When I get nervous,
I get scared.

1942
02:23:48,168 --> 02:23:52,382
When motherfuckers get scared, that's
when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.

1943
02:23:53,640 --> 02:23:57,272
Just know, you hurt him, you die.

1944
02:23:57,344 --> 02:24:00,749
Well, that seems to be
the situation.

1945
02:24:00,814 --> 02:24:02,750
But I don't want that.

1946
02:24:02,816 --> 02:24:04,752
And you don't want that.

1947
02:24:04,818 --> 02:24:07,551
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

1948
02:24:07,621 --> 02:24:09,716
So let's see what we can do.

1949
02:24:12,126 --> 02:24:15,360
Now... here's the situation.

1950
02:24:15,429 --> 02:24:19,300
Normally both your asses would be
dead as fuckin' fried chicken,

1951
02:24:19,301 --> 02:24:22,872
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period,

1952
02:24:22,873 --> 02:24:25,808
and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.

1953
02:24:25,873 --> 02:24:29,812
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

1954
02:24:29,813 --> 02:24:32,882
Besides, I been through too much shit
over this case this morning...

1955
02:24:32,883 --> 02:24:35,818
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

1956
02:24:35,883 --> 02:24:37,750
- Vincent!

1957
02:24:37,818 --> 02:24:40,756
- Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
- Get back!

1958
02:24:40,821 --> 02:24:43,520
It's cool!
We still just talkin'.

1959
02:24:43,591 --> 02:24:47,759
- Come on. Point the gun at me. Point the gun
at me. There you go. -

1960
02:24:47,828 --> 02:24:49,889
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...

1961
02:24:49,963 --> 02:24:51,899
and don't do a goddamn thing.

1962
02:24:51,965 --> 02:24:53,901
Tell her it's still cool.

1963
02:24:53,967 --> 02:24:56,905
- It's still cool, Honey Bunny.
- How we doin', baby?

1964
02:24:58,305 --> 02:25:00,970
I- I gotta go pee.

1965
02:25:01,041 --> 02:25:02,977
I wanna go home.

1966
02:25:03,043 --> 02:25:06,642
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.

1967
02:25:06,714 --> 02:25:09,652
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.

1968
02:25:09,717 --> 02:25:13,087
- I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.
- I love you.

1969
02:25:13,153 --> 02:25:16,319
- I love you too, Honey Bunny.
- Now,

1970
02:25:16,390 --> 02:25:20,330
I want you to go in that bag
and find my wallet.

1971
02:25:22,864 --> 02:25:26,804
- Which one is it?
- It's the one that says "Bad Motherfucker."

1972
02:25:41,061 --> 02:25:43,624
That's it.
That's my bad motherfucker.

1973
02:25:43,697 --> 02:25:46,794
Open it up.
Take out the money.

1974
02:25:51,838 --> 02:25:54,001
Count it.

1975
02:26:00,312 --> 02:26:02,840
How much is there?

1976
02:26:04,751 --> 02:26:06,687
About 1,500 dollars.

1977
02:26:06,753 --> 02:26:09,953
Okay, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

1978
02:26:10,023 --> 02:26:13,222
Now, with the rest
of those wallets and the register,

1979
02:26:13,223 --> 02:26:15,462
that makes this a pretty successful
little score, huh?

1980
02:26:15,463 --> 02:26:19,434
Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod 1,500
dollars, and I'll shoot him on general principle.

1981
02:26:19,435 --> 02:26:22,938
No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna
do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!

1982
02:26:22,939 --> 02:26:25,031
Vince, shut the fuck up!

1983
02:26:25,105 --> 02:26:28,977
- Shut up!
- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.

1984
02:26:29,042 --> 02:26:31,980
Now, I ain't givin' it
to him, Vincent.

1985
02:26:32,045 --> 02:26:33,981
I'm buyin' something
for my money.

1986
02:26:35,215 --> 02:26:38,415
- Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?
- What?

1987
02:26:38,484 --> 02:26:43,222
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.

1988
02:26:43,290 --> 02:26:45,989
You read the Bible, Ringo?

1989
02:26:47,060 --> 02:26:48,996
Not regularly, no.

1990
02:26:49,062 --> 02:26:51,498
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

1991
02:26:51,565 --> 02:26:55,095
Ezekiel 25:17.

1992
02:26:55,168 --> 02:26:58,004
<i>"The path of the righteous man</i>
<i>is beset on all sides...</i>

1993
02:26:58,071 --> 02:27:00,007
<i>by the inequities</i>
<i>of the selfish...</i>

1994
02:27:00,073 --> 02:27:02,009
<i>and the tyranny of evil men.</i>

1995
02:27:02,075 --> 02:27:05,444
<i>Blessed is he who,</i>
<i>in the name of charity and good will,</i>

1996
02:27:05,445 --> 02:27:08,015
<i>shepherds the weak</i>
<i>through the valley of darkness,</i>

1997
02:27:08,016 --> 02:27:12,114
<i>for he is truly his brother's keeper</i>
<i>and the finder of lost children.</i>

1998
02:27:12,185 --> 02:27:16,489
<i>And I will strike down upon thee with</i>
<i>great vengeance and furious anger...</i>

1999
02:27:16,557 --> 02:27:19,620
<i>those who attempt to poison</i>
<i>and destroy My brothers.</i>

2000
02:27:19,693 --> 02:27:22,722
<i>And you will know</i>
<i>I am the Lord...</i>

2001
02:27:22,796 --> 02:27:26,360
<i>when I lay My vengeance</i>
<i>upon you."</i>

2002
02:27:27,434 --> 02:27:29,871
I been sayin' that shit for years,

2003
02:27:29,936 --> 02:27:33,102
and if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

2004
02:27:33,173 --> 02:27:36,108
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2005
02:27:36,109 --> 02:27:39,181
I just thought it was some coldblooded
shit to say to a motherfucker...

2006
02:27:39,182 --> 02:27:41,616
before I popped a cap
in his ass.

2007
02:27:41,682 --> 02:27:45,121
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

2008
02:27:45,185 --> 02:27:48,123
See, now I'm thinkin'
maybe it means...

2009
02:27:48,188 --> 02:27:53,062
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man,

2010
02:27:53,126 --> 02:27:56,064
and Mr. 9-millimeter here,
he's the shepherd...

2011
02:27:56,129 --> 02:27:59,694
protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness.

2012
02:27:59,767 --> 02:28:01,703
Or it could mean...

2013
02:28:01,769 --> 02:28:05,208
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd,

2014
02:28:05,272 --> 02:28:09,212
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2015
02:28:09,276 --> 02:28:11,543
Now, I'd like that.

2016
02:28:11,612 --> 02:28:14,516
But that shit ain't the truth.

2017
02:28:14,582 --> 02:28:16,448
The truth is,

2018
02:28:17,518 --> 02:28:19,453
you're the weak...

2019
02:28:20,855 --> 02:28:24,259
and I'm the tyranny of evil men.

2020
02:28:25,660 --> 02:28:27,596
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2021
02:28:28,863 --> 02:28:31,801
I'm tryin' real hard...

2022
02:28:31,866 --> 02:28:34,132
to be the shepherd.

2023
02:28:49,449 --> 02:28:51,385
Go.

2024
02:29:09,070 --> 02:29:11,506
I think we should be
leaving now.

2025
02:29:11,572 --> 02:29:14,509
- Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

2026
02:29:19,509 --> 02:29:24,509
