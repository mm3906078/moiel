1
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,151
Men, are you over 40?

2
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:34,946
When you wake up in the morning,
do you feel tired and rundown?

3
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,391
Do you have that listless feeling?

4
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:16,339
Jefferies.

5
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,548
<i>Congratulations, Jeff.</i>

6
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:18,633
For what?

7
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,384
<i>For getting rid of that cast.</i>

8
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,428
Who said I was getting rid of it?

9
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,971
<i>This is Wednesday.</i>

10
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:27,850
<i>Seven weeks from the day you
broke your leg. Yes or no?</i>

11
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:33,564
Gunnison, how did you ever get to be such
a big editor with such a small memory?

12
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,608
<i>Thrift, industry and hard work.</i>

13
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,778
<i>And catching the publisher
with his secretary.</i>

14
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:39,862
<i>Did I get the wrong day?</i>

15
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,614
No.

16
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,449
No, wrong week.

17
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:48,162
Next Wednesday I emerge
from this plaster cocoon.

18
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,289
<i>That's too bad, Jeff.</i>

19
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:53,167
<i>Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day.</i>

20
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,585
<i>Forget I called.</i>

21
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,964
Yeah, I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison.

22
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:01,676
Must be rough on you thinking of me
wearing this cast for another whole week.

23
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,637
<i>That one week is gonna cost
me my best photographer</i>

24
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,973
<i>and you a big assignment.</i>

25
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,057
Where?

26
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,850
<i>There's no point in even talking about it.</i>

27
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,519
Oh, come on, come on. Where?

28
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,145
<i>Kashmir.</i>

29
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,856
<i>Got a code tip from the
bureau chief this morning.</i>

30
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,692
<i>The place is about to go up in smoke.</i>

31
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,576
What did I tell you? Didn't I tell
you that's the next place to watch?

32
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:21,612
<i>You did.</i>

33
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:24,031
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? Hour?

34
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,325
<i>With that cast on? You don't.</i>

35
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,661
Oh, stop sounding stuffy.

36
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,623
I can take pictures from a jeep
or a water buffalo, if necessary.

37
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,835
<i>You're too valuable to the magazine
for us to play around with.</i>

38
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,753
<i>I'll send Morgan or Lambert.</i>

39
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,755
Morgan or Lambert. That's fine.

40
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,967
I get myself half-killed for you,

41
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,594
and you reward me by
stealing my assignments.

42
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,348
<i>I didn't ask you to stand in the
middle of that automobile racetrack.</i>

43
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:53,978
You asked for something
dramatically different. You got it.

44
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,480
<i>So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.</i>

45
00:05:56,565 --> 00:06:00,026
Now wait a minute, Gunnison.
You've got to get me out of here.

46
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,570
Six weeks sitting in a two-room apartment

47
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,864
with nothing to do but look out
the window at the neighbors.

48
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:05,948
<i>Bye, Jeff.</i>

49
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,366
No, Gunnison, I...

50
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:10,244
If you don't pull me out
of this swamp of boredom,

51
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,163
I'm gonna do something drastic.

52
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,247
<i>Like what?</i>

53
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,373
"Like what"? I'm gonna get married.

54
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,709
And then I'll never be able to go anywhere.

55
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,169
<i>It's about time you got married,</i>

56
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:21,547
<i>before you turn into a
lonesome and bitter old man.</i>

57
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,051
Yeah, can't you just see me?

58
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,095
Rushing home to a hot apartment

59
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,141
to listen to the automatic laundry
and the electric dishwasher

60
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:36,937
and the garbage disposal
and the nagging wife.

61
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:40,566
<i>Jeff, wives don't nag
anymore, they discuss.</i>

62
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,235
Is that so? Is that so?

63
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,905
Well, maybe in the high-rent
district they discuss.

64
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,157
In my neighborhood, they still nag.

65
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,661
<i>Yeah? Well, you know best.
I'll call you later, Jeff.</i>

66
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,748
Yeah, have some good
news the next time, huh?

67
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,846
Good morning. I said, "Good morning"!

68
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,722
Oh, good morning.

69
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,535
Say, I wouldn't dig
so deep if I were you.

70
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,330
You're giving them
far too much water.

71
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,584
Why don't you shut up?

72
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,088
Well!

73
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,425
I do declare.

74
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,345
New York State sentence for a Peeping
Tom is six months in the workhouse.

75
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,972
Oh, hello, Stella.

76
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,683
And they got no windows in the workhouse.

77
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,770
You know, in the old days, they used to
put your eyes out with a red-hot poker.

78
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:46,775
Any of those bikini bombshells you're
always watching worth a red-hot poker?

79
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,905
Oh, dear. We've become a
race of Peeping Toms.

80
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,868
What people ought to do is get outside
their own house and look in for a change.

81
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,286
Yes, sir.

82
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,496
How's that for a bit
of homespun philosophy?

83
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,999
Reader's Digest, April, 1939.

84
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,251
- Well, I only quote from the best.
- Yeah.

85
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,545
You don't have to take my
temperature this morning.

86
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,381
Quiet. See if you can break 100.

87
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,884
You know, I should have
been a gypsy fortune-teller

88
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,053
instead of an
insurance-company nurse.

89
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:18,432
I got a nose for trouble.
Can smell it ten miles away.

90
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:22,895
You heard of that market crash in '29?
I predicted that.

91
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,105
Just how did you do that, Stella?

92
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,482
Oh, simple.

93
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,069
I was nursing a director
of General Motors.

94
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:34,281
"Kidney ailment," they said.
"Nerves," I said.

95
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:38,535
Then I asked myself, "What's General
Motors got to be nervous about?"

96
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,790
"Overproduction", I says. "Collapse".

97
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:46,460
When General Motors has to go
to the bathroom 10 times a day,

98
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,088
the whole country's
ready to let go.

99
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,424
You know, Stella, in economics,

100
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,219
a kidney ailment has no
relationship to the stock market.

101
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,470
None whatsoever.

102
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,597
Crashed, didn't it?

103
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,725
I can smell trouble right
here in this apartment.

104
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:06,397
First you smash your leg, then you
get to looking out the window,

105
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,149
see things you shouldn't see.
Trouble.

106
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,403
I can see you in court now,

107
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,948
surrounded by a bunch of lawyers
in double-breasted suits.

108
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:21,245
You're pleading. You say, "Judge, it
was only a little bit of innocent fun."

109
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,331
"I love my neighbors,
like a father."

110
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,458
And the judge says,
"Well, congratulations."

111
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,878
"You've just given birth
to three years in Dannemora."

112
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,631
Right now I'd welcome
trouble, you know.

113
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,258
You've got a hormone deficiency.

114
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,051
How can you tell
from a thermometer?

115
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,053
Those bathing beauties
you've been watching

116
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,598
haven't raised your temperature
one degree in a month.

117
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:45,811
Here we go.

118
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,360
One more week.

119
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,242
No, I think you're right. I think there
is gonna be trouble around here.

120
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,744
I knew it.

121
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,120
Ooh!

122
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,414
Do you ever heat that stuff?

123
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,249
Gives your circulation
something to fight.

124
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,334
Oh, I see.

125
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,960
What kind of trouble?

126
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,795
Lisa Fremont.

127
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,088
You kidding?

128
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:17,843
She's a beautiful young girl, and
you're a reasonably healthy young man.

129
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,219
She expects me to marry her.

130
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,346
That's normal.

131
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,638
I don't want to.

132
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:22,723
That's abnormal.

133
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,434
I just... I'm not
ready for marriage.

134
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,687
Every man's ready for marriage
when the right girl comes along.

135
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,690
And Lisa Fremont is the right girl
for any man with half a brain

136
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,192
who can get one eye open.

137
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,860
She's all right.

138
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,862
- What'd you do, have a fight?
- No.

139
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,530
Father loading up the shotgun?

140
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:39,656
What?

141
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:40,908
Please, Stella.

142
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,534
It's happened before, you know.

143
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,161
Some of the world's
happiest marriages

144
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,748
have started "under the
gun", as you might say.

145
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,193
No, she's just not
the girl for me.

146
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,417
Yeah, she's only perfect.

147
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:55,506
She's too perfect. She's too talented. She's
too beautiful. She's too sophisticated.

148
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,633
She's too everything
but what I want.

149
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,095
Is what you want something
you can discuss?

150
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,597
What? It's very
simple, Stella.

151
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:07,768
She belongs to that rarefied
atmosphere of Park Avenue, you know.

152
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,021
Expensive restaurants and
literary cocktail parties.

153
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,148
People with sense belong
wherever they're put.

154
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,151
Can you imagine her traveling
around the world with a camera bum

155
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,320
who never has more than a
week's salary in the bank?

156
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,073
If she was only ordinary.

157
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,450
You never gonna get married?

158
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,994
I'll probably get married
one of these days,

159
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,539
but when I do, it's gonna be
to someone who thinks of life

160
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:33,293
not just as a new dress
and a lobster dinner

161
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,421
or latest scandal.

162
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,507
I need a woman who's
willing to... Hold it.

163
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:42,469
Who's willing to go anywhere
and do anything and love it.

164
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,140
So the honest thing for me to do
is just call the whole thing off.

165
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,225
Let her find somebody else.

166
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,227
Yeah, I can hear you now.

167
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,563
"Get out of my life, you
perfectly wonderful woman."

168
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,314
"You're too
good for me."

169
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,775
Look, Mr. Jefferies, I'm
not an educated woman,

170
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,610
but I can tell you one thing.

171
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:02,030
When a man and a woman see each
other and like each other,

172
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:06,452
they ought to come together, wham,
like a couple of taxis on Broadway,

173
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:10,747
and not sit around analyzing each
other like two specimens in a bottle.

174
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,959
There's an intelligent way
to approach marriage.

175
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,169
Intelligence.

176
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:19,214
Nothing has caused the human race
so much trouble as intelligence.

177
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,009
Modern marriage.

178
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,636
No, we've progressed
emotionally.

179
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,096
Baloney.

180
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:29,516
Once it was, "See somebody,
get excited, get married."

181
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,396
Now it's, "Read a lot of books, fence
with a lot of four-syllable words",

182
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,231
"psychoanalyze each other"

183
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,900
"until you can't tell
the difference between"

184
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:41,987
"a petting party and
a civil service exam."

185
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,531
People have different
emotional levels...

186
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:48,494
When I married Myles, we were both
a couple of maladjusted misfits.

187
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:53,999
We are still maladjusted misfits, and
we have loved every minute of it.

188
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,123
Well, that's fine, Stella.

189
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,169
Now, would you fix me
a sandwich, please?

190
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,462
Yes, I will.

191
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,423
And I'll spread a little
common sense on the bread.

192
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,343
Lisa's loaded to her
fingertips with love for you.

193
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,471
I got two words of advice for you.
Marry her.

194
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,805
She pay you much?

195
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:09,932
Oh!

196
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,325
There.

197
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,498
- Here's the key.
- Thank you.

198
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,175
Well, if you want
anything, just ring.

199
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,315
Honey. Come on.

200
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,492
Got to carry you
over the threshold.

201
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,100
Window shopper.

202
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,110
How's your leg?

203
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,570
It hurts a little.

204
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,656
And your stomach?

205
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,240
Empty as a football.

206
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,828
And your love life?

207
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,538
Not too active.

208
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,250
Anything else bothering you?

209
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:43,877
Mmm-hmm.

210
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,129
Who are you?

211
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:52,636
Reading from top to bottom, Lisa

212
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,474
Carol

213
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,105
Fremont.

214
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:08,151
Is this the Lisa Fremont who never
wears the same dress twice?

215
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,696
Only because it's
expected of her.

216
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,533
It's right off the Paris plane.
Do you think it'll sell?

217
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,202
That depends on the quote,
you know. Let's see now.

218
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:22,040
There's the airplane ticket over and import
duties, hidden taxes, profit markup...

219
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,084
A steal at $1100.

220
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,503
1100?

221
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,047
They ought to list that dress
on the stock exchange.

222
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:32,175
Why, we sell a dozen a
day in this price range.

223
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,719
Who buys them, tax collectors?

224
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:37,264
Even if I had to pay, it would be worth it.
Just for the occasion.

225
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,474
Why, is something big
going on somewhere?

226
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,352
It's going on right here. It's a big night.

227
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:47,774
It's just an old run-on-the-mill Wednesday.
The calendar's full of them.

228
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:52,904
It's opening night of the last depressing
week of L.B. Jefferies in a cast.

229
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:56,575
Well, I haven't noticed a big
demand for tickets or anything.

230
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,453
That's because I
bought out the house.

231
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:02,330
You know, this cigarette
box has seen better days.

232
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:06,960
I picked that up in Shanghai,
which has also seen better days.

233
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:11,339
It's cracked and you never use it.
It's too ornate.

234
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:15,302
I'm sending up a plain, flat, silver
one with just your initials engraved.

235
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:18,054
That's no way to spend
your hard-earned money.

236
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,556
Well, I wanted to.

237
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,391
Oh!

238
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:26,396
What would you think of
starting off with dinner at 21?

239
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:29,024
You have, perhaps, an
ambulance downstairs?

240
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,694
No, better than that. 21.

241
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,702
Thank you for waiting, Carl. The
kitchen's right there on the left.

242
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,537
Oh, I'll take the wine.

243
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,042
- Good evening, Mr. Jefferies.
- Carl.

244
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,753
Just put everything in
the oven, Carl, on low.

245
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,463
- Yes, madam.
- Let's open the wine now.

246
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,923
All right.

247
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,133
It's a Montrachet.

248
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:58,386
A great big glassful. There's
a corkscrew right over there.

249
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,848
Here, I'll do it.

250
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:04,601
Big enough?

251
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,144
Yeah, they're fine.

252
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:10,065
I can't think of anything more boring or
tiresome than what you've been through,

253
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,942
- and the last week must be the hardest.
- Let me, sir.

254
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,610
All right.

255
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,780
Yeah, I want to get this
thing off and get moving.

256
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:20,408
Well, I'm going to make this
a week you'll never forget.

257
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,913
Fine, thanks.

258
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,290
Just a minute, Carl.

259
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,334
This will take care
of the taxi as well.

260
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,627
Thank you, Miss Fremont.

261
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,212
Have a pleasant dinner, Mr.
Jefferies.

262
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,589
All right. Good night.

263
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,091
Good night.

264
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,845
What a day I've had.

265
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:40,929
Are you tired?

266
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,055
Not a bit.

267
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,307
I was all morning
in a sales meeting,

268
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,894
then I had to dash to the Waldorf for
a quick drink with Madame Dufresne,

269
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:51,147
who's just over from Paris
with some spy reports.

270
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:56,278
And then I had to go to '21 ' and have
lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people.

271
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,363
And that's when
I ordered dinner.

272
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,199
Then I had two fall
showings 20 blocks apart.

273
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,869
Then I had to have a cocktail
with Leland and Slim Hayward.

274
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,662
We're trying to
get his new show.

275
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,789
And then I had to
dash back and change.

276
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:12,419
Well, now, tell me. Tell me. Now,
what was Mrs. Hayward wearing?

277
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,379
- Oh, she looked wonderfully cool.
- She did.

278
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,340
She had on the most
divine Italian hand-print

279
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,426
- mousseline de soie...
- Oh, Italian?

280
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,553
- Oh, you.
- Italian. Imagine.

281
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:25,098
To think I planted three nice items
in the columns about you today.

282
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,182
You did?

283
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:27,726
You can't buy that
kind of publicity.

284
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,394
I know.

285
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:33,356
Someday you may want to open
up a studio of your own here.

286
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:37,110
How would I run it
from, say, Pakistan?

287
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,446
Jeff...

288
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:44,743
Isn't it time you came home? You
could pick your assignment.

289
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,662
I wish there was one I wanted.

290
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:48,997
Make the one you want.

291
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:50,916
- You mean leave the magazine?
- Yes.

292
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
For what?

293
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,919
For yourself and me.

294
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,297
I could get you a dozen
assignments tomorrow.

295
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,343
Don't laugh. I could do it.

296
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,219
That's what I'm afraid of.

297
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:06,556
Can you see me driving down to
the fashion salon in a jeep,

298
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:09,768
wearing combat boots
and a three-day beard?

299
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,227
Wouldn't that make a hit?

300
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:15,982
I could see you looking very handsome and
successful in a dark blue flannel suit.

301
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:19,653
Let's stop talking
nonsense, shall we?

302
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:20,820
Hmm?

303
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,451
Guess I'd better start
setting up for dinner.

304
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,494
Miss Lonelyheart.

305
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:35,413
At least that's something you'll
never have to worry about.

306
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:37,082
Oh?

307
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:41,044
You can see my apartment from here,
all the way up on 63rd Street?

308
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:44,297
No, not exactly, but we have
a little apartment here

309
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,591
that's probably about
as popular as yours.

310
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:50,261
You remember, of course, Miss
Torso, the ballet dancer?

311
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:54,557
She's like a queen bee with
her pick of the drones.

312
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:07,987
I'd say she's doing a woman's hardest job.
Juggling wolves.

313
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,371
Thank you.

314
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,302
Well, she picked the most
prosperous-looking one.

315
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:34,472
She's not in love with
him or any of them.

316
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:37,142
Oh, how can you
tell that from here?

317
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:41,437
You said it resembled
my apartment, didn't you?

318
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,081
I hope they're cooked this time.

319
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,919
Where's that wonderful
music coming from?

320
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:31,256
Some songwriter over there
in the studio apartment.

321
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,715
Wow!

322
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,844
He lives alone. Probably
had a very unhappy marriage.

323
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,348
Oh, it's enchanting.

324
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:47,272
It's almost as if it were being
written especially for us.

325
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,398
Hmm.

326
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,484
No wonder he's having so
much trouble with it.

327
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,823
At least you can't say
the dinner isn't right.

328
00:26:56,907 --> 00:27:00,034
Lisa, it's perfect.

329
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,538
As always.

330
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,802
There can't be that much difference
between people and the way they live.

331
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,346
We all eat, talk, drink,
laugh, wear clothes.

332
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:21,889
Well, now look...

333
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,809
If you're saying all this because you
don't want to tell me the truth,

334
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,228
because you're hiding something from
me, then maybe I can understand.

335
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,980
I'm not hiding anything.
It's just that...

336
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,440
It doesn't make sense.

337
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:33,651
What's so different about it here
from over there or anyplace you go

338
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:36,321
that one person couldn't live
in both places just as easily?

339
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:37,989
Some people can. Now, if
you'll just let me...

340
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:41,409
What is it but traveling from one
place to another, taking pictures?

341
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,661
It's just like being a tourist
on an endless vacation.

342
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,079
Okay. Now
that's your opinion.

343
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,998
You're entitled to it. Now,
let me give you my side.

344
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,125
It's ridiculous to say
that it can only be done

345
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:52,253
by a special, private little
group of anointed people.

346
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:55,298
I made a simple statement,
a true statement,

347
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,885
but I can back it up if you'd
just shut up for a minute.

348
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:02,305
If your opinion is as rude as your
manner, I don't think I care to hear it.

349
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,806
Oh, come on now.
Simmer down.

350
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:07,185
I can't fit in here.
You can't fit in there.

351
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:10,521
I mean, according to you, people should
be born, live and die on the same spot!

352
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:11,814
Shut up!

353
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,944
Did you ever eat
fish heads and rice?

354
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,654
Of course not.

355
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:21,282
Well, you might have
to if you went with me.

356
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:27,121
Did you ever try to keep warm in a C-54
at 15,000 feet, 20 degrees below zero?

357
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:30,375
Oh, I do it all the time. Whenever
I have a few minutes after lunch.

358
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,919
Did you ever get shot at?
Did you ever get run over?

359
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,420
Did you ever get
sandbagged at night

360
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:37,799
because somebody got unfavorable
publicity from your camera?

361
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,676
Did you ever... Those high heels,
they'll be great in the jungle.

362
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,929
And the nylons and
those six-ounce lingerie.

363
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,555
- Three.
- All right, three.

364
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,059
They'll make a big hit in Finland,
just before you freeze to death.

365
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:51,729
Well, if there's one thing I know,
it's how to wear the proper clothes.

366
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:52,980
Yeah, yeah.

367
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,609
Well, try and find a raincoat in
Brazil, even when it isn't raining.

368
00:28:56,693 --> 00:29:00,321
Lisa, in this job
you carry one suitcase.

369
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:02,907
Your home is the available
transportation.

370
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,159
You don't sleep very
much. You bathe less.

371
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,286
And sometimes the
food that you eat

372
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:11,124
is made from things that you couldn't
even look at when they're alive.

373
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:15,002
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately
repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.

374
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:18,423
Deliberately repulsive? I'm just
trying to make it sound good.

375
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:21,759
You just have to face it, Lisa, you're
not meant for that kind of a life.

376
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:23,553
Few people are.

377
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,889
You're too stubborn
to argue with.

378
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:30,435
I'm not stubborn.
I'm just truthful.

379
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:34,397
I know, a lesser man would have
told me it was one long holiday,

380
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:38,192
and I would have been awakened
to a rude disillusionment.

381
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,570
Oh, well now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

382
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:45,491
If you want to get vicious on this thing,
I'd be very happy to accommodate you.

383
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:49,745
No, I don't
particularly want that.

384
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,624
So that's it?

385
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,836
You won't stay here,
and I can't go with you.

386
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,046
It would be the wrong thing.

387
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:05,219
You don't think either one
of us could ever change?

388
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,513
Right now it doesn't seem so.

389
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:16,397
I'm in love with you. I don't
care what you do for a living.

390
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,359
I'd just like to be
part of it somehow.

391
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:25,573
It's deflating to find out the
only way I can be part of it

392
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,784
is to take out a subscription
to your magazine.

393
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:33,122
I guess I'm not the
girl I thought I was.

394
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,208
There's nothing wrong
with you, Lisa.

395
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:38,294
You've got this town in
the palm of your hand.

396
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,923
Not quite, it seems.

397
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,718
Goodbye, Jeff.

398
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,011
You mean good night.

399
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,471
I mean what I said.

400
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,933
Well, Lisa, couldn't we just...

401
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:53,601
Uh...

402
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:58,064
Couldn't we just keep
things status quo?

403
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:02,527
Without any future?

404
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,987
When am I gonna see you again?

405
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,533
Not for a long time.

406
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,744
At least

407
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,871
not until tomorrow night.

408
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,118
Don't!

409
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:18,519
Hey! Rain.

410
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,985
Grab that. The rest of the blanket.
Wait, I'll get the clock.

411
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,403
Oh, no!

412
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,616
Put it in, now.

413
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,912
Pull on it.

414
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,956
Let me do it.

415
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,708
In you go.

416
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:00,681
No, you can't come in.
It's much too late.

417
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:05,102
No, no, not now. Get your foot out
of the way. No, I said good night.

418
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,788
What's that supposed
to be, ma'am?

419
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:49,874
It's called "Hunger".

420
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:16,191
You'd think the rain would
have cooled things off.

421
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,443
All it did was
make the heat wet.

422
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:18,569
That's it.
That's it.

423
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,654
That's stiff one, right there.
Right there.

424
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,157
You know, the insurance
company would be much happier

425
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,285
if you'd sleep in bed at night
instead of in that wheelchair.

426
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,453
How'd you know?

427
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,204
Eyes are all bloodshot.

428
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,249
Must have been watching out
that window for hours.

429
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:32,791
Yeah, I was.

430
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:34,460
What are you gonna do if
one of them catches you?

431
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,086
It depends which one.

432
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:37,671
Miss Torso, for example...

433
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,924
You keep your mind off her.

434
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,468
She sure is the "Eat,
drink and be merry" girl.

435
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,721
Yeah, she'll wind up fat,
alcoholic and miserable.

436
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,097
Yeah.

437
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:53,312
Speaking of misery, poor Miss Lonelyheart.
She drank herself to sleep again, alone.

438
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,606
Poor soul.
Oh, well.

439
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,691
Maybe one day she'll
find her happiness.

440
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:00,611
Yeah, and some man
will lose his.

441
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:04,281
Isn't there anybody in the neighborhood
who could cast an eye in her direction?

442
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:05,741
I don't know.

443
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:09,536
It just might be that the
salesman will be available soon.

444
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:11,497
Oh, him and his wife
splitting up?

445
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:13,290
I just can't figure it.

446
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:18,045
He went out several times last night
in the rain, carrying his sample case.

447
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,409
Well, he's a salesman, isn't he?

448
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,799
What would he be selling
at 3:00 in the morning?

449
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,300
Flashlights.

450
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:27,554
Luminous dials for watches.
House numbers that light up.

451
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,849
I don't think so.
I don't think so.

452
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:33,978
I think he was taking something
out of the apartment.

453
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,062
Uh-huh.

454
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,148
His personal effects.

455
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,610
He's gonna run out
on her, the coward.

456
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:43,153
Yeah.

457
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,906
Sometimes it's worse
to stay than it is to run.

458
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:50,828
Yeah, well, it takes a particularly low
type of man to do a thing like that.

459
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,624
How about this morning?
Any further developments?

460
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,752
The shades are all
drawn in the apartment.

461
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,879
- In this heat?
- Yeah.

462
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:02,798
Well, they're up now.

463
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,014
Get back!
Get back!

464
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,348
Where do you want me to go?

465
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:12,725
Come on, get out of sight.
Get out of sight.

466
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,226
What is it?
What's the matter?

467
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,021
That salesman's looking out
of his window. You see?

468
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,064
Get back!
He'll see you.

469
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:21,608
I'm not shy. I've been
looked at before.

470
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,652
That's no ordinary look.

471
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,031
That's the kind
of look a man gives

472
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:30,284
when he's afraid somebody
might be watching him.

473
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,428
Get away from there. Get away from there.
He'll be after you.

474
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,722
Go on, into the house.
Into the house.

475
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:57,311
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies.
See you tomorrow.

476
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,645
Uh-huh.

477
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,364
And don't sleep in
that chair again.

478
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:10,449
Uh-huh.

479
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:11,700
"Uh-huh.
Uh-huh."

480
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,952
Great conversationalist.

481
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,664
Stella.

482
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:22,628
Take those binoculars out of the
case and bring them here, will you?

483
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:25,547
Trouble.
I can smell it.

484
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,676
I'll be glad when they crack that
cast, and I can get out of here.

485
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:30,928
Uh-huh.

486
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,522
How far does a girl have to
go before you'll notice her?

487
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:14,651
Well, if she's pretty enough, she
doesn't have to go anywhere.

488
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:16,945
She just has to "be."

489
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,071
Well, ain't I?

490
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,657
Pay attention to me.

491
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,788
I'm not exactly on the
other side of the room.

492
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:28,832
Your mind is...

493
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:32,586
And when I want a man,
I want all of him.

494
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:38,675
Don't you ever
have any problems?

495
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,385
I have one now.

496
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,180
So do I.

497
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,641
Tell me about it.

498
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,103
Why...

499
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:57,027
Why would a man leave his apartment three
times on a rainy night with a suitcase,

500
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,863
and come back three times?

501
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,782
He likes the way his
wife welcomes him home.

502
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,784
No, no. No, no.

503
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:06,870
No, no. Not this
salesman's wife.

504
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,955
And why didn't he
go to work today?

505
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,375
Homework. It's
more interesting.

506
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:17,547
What's interesting
about a butcher knife

507
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:20,050
and a small saw

508
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,552
wrapped in newspaper?
Hmm?

509
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:25,222
Nothing, thank heaven.

510
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:28,183
Why hasn't he been in his
wife's bedroom all day?

511
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,435
I wouldn't dare answer that.

512
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:37,275
Well, listen. I'll answer it, Lisa.
There's something terribly wrong.

513
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,447
And I'm afraid it's with me.

514
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:43,532
What do you think?

515
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,494
Something too
frightful to utter.

516
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:53,333
He went out a few minutes ago in his
undershirt, hasn't come back yet.

517
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,682
That'd be a terrible
job to tackle.

518
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:17,732
Just how would you start
to cut up a human body?

519
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:24,406
Jeff, I'll be honest with you. You're
beginning to scare me a little.

520
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:29,188
Jeff, did you hear what I said?
You're beginning to scare...

521
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,204
Shh! Shh!

522
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,998
He's coming back!

523
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,777
Jeff, if you could
only see yourself!

524
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:03,862
What's the matter?

525
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,587
Sitting around looking out of the
window to kill time is one thing,

526
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:10,702
but doing it the way you are,
with binoculars and wild opinions

527
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:13,413
about every little thing
you see, is diseased!

528
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:16,166
What, do you think I
consider it recreation?

529
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,001
I don't know what
you consider it,

530
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,170
but if you don't stop it,
I'm getting out of here.

531
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,338
What's the...

532
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:22,797
What is it you're looking for?

533
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:25,675
I just want to find out what's the matter
with the salesman's wife, that's all.

534
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,427
Does that make me
sound like a madman?

535
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,346
What makes you think there's
something the matter with her?

536
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:33,016
A lot of things. She's an invalid.
She demands constant care.

537
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:37,354
Yet neither the husband or anybody else
has been in to see her all day. Why?

538
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,440
Maybe she died.

539
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:43,193
Where's the doctor?
Where's the undertaker?

540
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,154
She could be sleeping,
under sedatives.

541
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:49,074
He's in there now.
There's nothing to see.

542
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:51,660
There is something... I've
seen it through that window.

543
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:54,579
I've seen bickering
and family quarrels

544
00:47:54,664 --> 00:47:57,916
and mysterious trips at night
and knives and saws and ropes.

545
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,876
And now, since last evening,
not a sign of the wife.

546
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:01,336
All right. Now you
tell me where she is.

547
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:03,382
- I don't know.
- What's she doing? Where is she?

548
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:06,424
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know.
I don't care!

549
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:09,636
Lots of people have knives and saws
and ropes around their houses.

550
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,681
And lots of men don't speak
to their wives all day.

551
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:15,350
Lots of wives nag and men
hate them and trouble starts,

552
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:19,563
but very, very few of them end up in
murder, if that's what you're thinking.

553
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:22,087
It's pretty hard for you to keep
away from that word, isn't it?

554
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:24,776
- You could see all that he did, couldn't you?
- Of course...

555
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,486
You could see because
the shades were up

556
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:29,864
and he walked along the corridor
and the street and the backyard.

557
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,324
I've seen him in the backyard,
fixing the flowers...

558
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:34,411
Oh, Jeff, do you think a murderer
would let you see all that?

559
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:37,205
That he wouldn't pull the shades
down and hide behind them?

560
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:39,416
Just where he's being clever.
He's being nonchalant about it.

561
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,334
And that's where you're
not being clever.

562
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:45,255
A murderer would never parade his
crime in front of an open window.

563
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,423
Why not?

564
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:47,507
Why, for all you know,

565
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:50,760
there's probably something a lot more
sinister going on behind those windows.

566
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,095
Where?

567
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,263
Oh!

568
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:57,225
No comment.

569
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:23,418
Let's start from the
beginning again, Jeff.

570
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:26,880
Tell me everything you saw

571
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,758
and what you think it means.

572
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,229
Yeah?

573
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:44,435
<i>The name on the second floor</i>

574
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:47,984
<i>rear mail box reads,
"Mr. And Mrs. Lars."</i>

575
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:50,445
<i>That's L-A-R-S.</i>

576
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,489
<i>Lars Thorwald.</i>

577
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,240
What's the number of
the apartment house?

578
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,868
<i>125 West 9th Street.</i>

579
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,496
Thank you, dear.

580
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,831
<i>Okay, chief. What's my next assignment?</i>

581
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:02,916
Just go home.

582
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,711
<i>All right, but what's he doing now?</i>

583
00:50:06,796 --> 00:50:10,256
He's just sitting in the
living room in the dark.

584
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,593
Hasn't gone near the bedroom.

585
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:15,345
Now you go home and get some sleep.

586
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,389
- Good night.
<i>- Good night.</i>

587
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,566
<i>All right. What's it all about, Jeff?</i>

588
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:31,986
Now look, Doyle, it's just something
I can't tell you over the telephone.

589
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:33,947
You have to be here
and see the whole setup.

590
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,031
<i>Important, huh?</i>

591
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:36,616
Well, it's probably
nothing important at all.

592
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:38,785
It's just a little neighborhood
murder, that's all.

593
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:39,950
<i>Did you say "murder", Jeff?</i>

594
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:41,579
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I did say "murder".

595
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:43,039
<i>Oh, come now.</i>

596
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:46,459
My only thought was throwing a little
business your way, that's all.

597
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:49,544
I figured a good detective would jump
at the chance of something to detect.

598
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,214
<i>- I'm not working.</i>
- What?

599
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,966
<i>This happens to be my day off.</i>

600
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,010
Well, I usually took my best
pictures on my day off.

601
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:57,178
<i>I'll drop by.</i>

602
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:59,889
Okay, Doyle. All right. As soon as you can.

603
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:05,103
Bless your heart, Stella.
Gee whiz, look at this.

604
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,147
I can't tell you what a
welcome sight this is.

605
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,232
No wonder your husband still loves you.

606
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,900
- The police.
- What?

607
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:11,985
You called the police.

608
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,987
Well, not exactly.

609
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:17,782
Not an official call. It's
just an old friend of mine.

610
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:20,910
An old, ornery friend of mine.

611
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:23,830
Just where do you suppose he cut her up?

612
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,001
Of course. The bathtub.

613
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:32,922
That's the only place where he
could have washed away the blood.

614
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:45,685
He better get that trunk out of
there before it starts to leak.

615
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:08,625
Harry?

616
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:16,049
Look, look, Mr. Jefferies.

617
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:56,035
I thought Doyle would be here
by the time the trunk left,

618
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,550
or I'd have called the police.
Now we're gonna lose it.

619
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,218
- Hold everything.
- Don't do anything foolish.

620
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,136
I'm just gonna get the name
off that freight truck.

621
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:04,472
I'll keep an eye on the alley.

622
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,654
Long distance.

623
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:48,391
You didn't see the killing or the body.
How do you know there was a murder?

624
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,519
Because everything this fellow's
done has been suspicious.

625
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:55,356
Trips at night in the rain, and
knives and saws and trunks with rope

626
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:57,692
and now this wife that isn't there anymore.

627
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:02,572
I admit it all has a mysterious sound.
It could be any number of things.

628
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:03,990
Murder's the least plausible.

629
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,492
Doyle, don't tell me he's
an unemployed magician,

630
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:09,579
amusing the neighborhood with his
sleight of hand. Don't tell me that.

631
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,081
It's too obvious and stupid
a way to commit murder.

632
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,791
In full view of 50 windows?

633
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:15,084
Then sit over there smoking a cigar,

634
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:16,753
waiting for the police
to come and pick him up?

635
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:19,255
All right, Officer, do your duty.
Go over and pick him up.

636
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:22,592
Jeff, you've got a lot
to learn about homicide.

637
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,886
Why, morons have committed
murder so shrewdly,

638
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:28,222
it's taken a hundred trained
police minds to catch them.

639
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:30,934
That salesman wouldn't just
knock his wife off after dinner

640
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:33,519
and toss her in the trunk
and put her in storage.

641
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:34,938
I'll bet it's been done.

642
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:38,232
Most everything's been done, under panic.

643
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:40,401
This is a thousand-to-one shot.

644
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:43,780
He's still sitting around the apartment.
That man's not panicked.

645
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,949
You think I made all this up?

646
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:47,951
Well, I think you saw something.

647
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:50,662
There's probably a very
simple explanation for that.

648
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:52,288
For instance?

649
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:53,915
Wife took a trip.

650
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:56,000
His wife was sick in bed.

651
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:59,253
Yeah, so you told me.

652
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,299
Well, Jeff, I've got to run along.

653
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:09,806
I won't report this to the department.
Let me poke into it a little on my own.

654
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:12,642
No sense in your getting a
lot of ridiculous publicity.

655
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,060
Thank you.

656
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:19,232
We know the wife is gone, so I'll
see if I can find out where.

657
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,566
Do that.

658
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:24,278
You had any headaches lately?

659
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:25,738
Not until you showed up.

660
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:29,784
It'll wear off, along
with the hallucinations.

661
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,452
See you around.

662
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,311
Get along.

663
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:20,084
He has a six months' lease.

664
00:56:20,169 --> 00:56:23,129
Used up a little more than
five and a half months of it.

665
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,631
He's quiet, drinks, but not to drunkenness.

666
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:28,634
Pays his bills promptly with money
earned as a costume jewelry salesman.

667
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:30,053
Wholesale.

668
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:33,431
Kept to himself. None of his neighbors
got close to him or his wife.

669
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,349
Yeah, well, I think they
missed their chance with her.

670
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:36,434
She never left the apartment...

671
00:56:36,477 --> 00:56:38,269
- Where is she? The icebox?
- ...until yesterday morning.

672
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,730
- What time?
- 6:00 a.m.

673
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,148
6:00 a.m.

674
00:56:43,192 --> 00:56:45,985
I think that's about the
time I fell asleep.

675
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,320
Too bad.

676
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:51,491
Thorwalds were leaving their
apartment at just that time.

677
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,535
Feel a little foolish?

678
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:56,496
No, not yet.

679
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,926
How's your wife?

680
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,177
Oh, she's fine.

681
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,891
Who said they left then?

682
00:57:17,518 --> 00:57:18,518
Who left where?

683
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:20,686
The Thorwalds, at 6:00 in the morning.

684
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:23,439
Oh, the building superintendent
and two tenants.

685
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:26,567
Flat statements, no hesitation.
They jived with the letter.

686
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:29,070
Thorwalds were on their way
to the railroad station.

687
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:32,698
Well, now, Tom, how could
anybody possibly guess that?

688
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:36,911
What, did they have signs on their
luggage, saying, "Grand Central or bust"?

689
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,747
The superintendent met
Thorwald on his way back.

690
00:57:39,832 --> 00:57:42,959
Thorwald told him that he'd put his
wife on a train to the country.

691
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:46,212
I see. I'd say this is a pretty
convenient guy, this superintendent.

692
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:49,215
Have you checked his
bank statements lately?

693
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:51,467
Huh?

694
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:54,095
Well, what good's his information?

695
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:56,556
It's a secondhand version
of an unsupported story

696
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,391
by the murderer himself, Thorwald.

697
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:02,019
Now did anybody actually see
the wife get on the train?

698
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,021
I hate to remind you,

699
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:06,858
but this all started because
you said she was murdered.

700
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:10,069
Now, did anyone, including you,
actually see her murdered?

701
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:11,988
What are you doing?

702
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:16,117
Are you interested in solving this
case or in making me look foolish?

703
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:18,327
Well, if possible, both.

704
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:19,912
Well, then, do a good job of it.

705
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:21,873
Go over there and search
Thorwald's apartment.

706
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:23,833
It must be knee-deep in evidence.

707
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,376
I can't do that.

708
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,712
Well, no, I don't mean right now,
but when he goes out for a drink,

709
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:30,047
or a paper, or something. What
he doesn't know won't hurt him.

710
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:32,508
I can't do that, even if he isn't there.

711
00:58:32,593 --> 00:58:37,346
What's he... Does he have a courtesy card
from the police department, or something?

712
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:39,265
Now don't get me mad.

713
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:42,602
Not even a detective can walk
into an apartment and search it.

714
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:45,771
If I were caught in there, they'd
have my badge within 10 minutes.

715
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:48,357
All right. Make sure you don't
get caught, that's all.

716
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:50,693
What? If you find something,
you've got a murderer,

717
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,862
and they don't care anything
about a couple of house rules.

718
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,031
If you don't find anything,
the fellow's clear.

719
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:59,535
At the risk of sounding stuffy, I'd
like to remind you of the Constitution

720
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,496
and the phrase, "Search
warrant issued by a judge"

721
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:04,624
"who knows his Bill of Rights verbatim."

722
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,292
He must ask for evidence.

723
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,710
Give him evidence.

724
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:11,505
Yeah, I can hear myself.

725
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:15,635
"Your Honor, I have a friend
who's an amateur sleuth."

726
00:59:16,637 --> 00:59:20,389
"Well, the other night after
having a heavy dinner, he..."

727
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:22,934
He'd throw the New York State
penal code right in my face.

728
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:25,061
And there's six volumes.

729
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:28,522
You know, by tomorrow morning there
may not be any evidence left

730
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,733
over in that apartment. You know that.

731
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:33,110
It's a detective's nightmare.

732
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,905
What do you need before you can search?

733
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,229
Tell me. Now, what do you need?

734
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,784
Bloody footsteps leading up to the door?

735
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:43,537
One thing I don't need is heckling.
You called me and asked for help.

736
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:46,165
Now you're behaving like a taxpayer.

737
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,918
How did we ever stand
each other in that plane

738
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:51,003
for three years during the war?

739
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,340
I guess I'll go over to the railroad
station and check on Thorwald's story.

740
00:59:56,385 --> 00:59:58,094
Oh, forget about the story.

741
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:00,846
Find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it.

742
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:02,431
Oh, I almost forgot.

743
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:05,893
There was a postcard in
Thorwald's mailbox. It was

744
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:09,146
mailed 3:30 yesterday
afternoon from Merritsville.

745
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:11,315
That's 80 miles north of here.

746
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,194
Message went, "Arrived okay.
Already feeling better."

747
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:16,737
"Love, Anna."

748
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:20,574
Oh...

749
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:22,034
Is that...

750
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:25,496
Anna... Is that who I think it is?

751
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:28,207
Mrs. Thorwald.

752
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,005
Oh, so anything you need, Jeff?

753
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:36,924
You might send me a good detective.

754
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,986
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello, Miss Doyle?

755
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:27,071
<i>Yes?</i>

756
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:28,697
This is Jeff again.
Has Tom come in yet?

757
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:29,782
<i>Not yet, Jeff.</i>

758
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:31,825
You mean you haven't
even heard from him?

759
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:35,412
<i>Not a word. Is it something
really important, Jeff?</i>

760
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:37,164
Yeah, I'm afraid it is, Tess.

761
01:04:37,249 --> 01:04:39,250
<i>I'll have him call the
moment I hear from him.</i>

762
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:40,709
No, no, don't bother to do that.

763
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:43,379
Just have him get over
here as soon as he can.

764
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:45,172
Looks like Thorwald's pulling out tonight.

765
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:46,257
<i>Who's Thorwald?</i>

766
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:47,424
He'll know, he'll know.

767
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:50,219
And Thorwald's a man, Tess, don't worry.

768
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,680
<i>- Good night, you idiot.</i>
- Good night.

769
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,282
Long distance again.

770
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:49,153
There's somebody at the door.

771
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,534
- Hi.
- Hello.

772
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:19,058
Hello.

773
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:23,687
What'd you do to your hair?

774
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,481
- Oh, well, I just sort of...
- Take a look at Thorwald.

775
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:29,026
He's getting ready to pull out for good.
Look at him.

776
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:33,989
He doesn't seem to be in any hurry.

777
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:36,575
He's been laying out all his
things on one of the beds.

778
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,911
Shirts, suits, coats, socks.

779
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:41,121
Even his wife's... That alligator handbag

780
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,540
- his wife had on the bedpost.
- What about it?

781
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:46,377
He had it hidden in the dresser.
At least, it was there.

782
01:06:46,461 --> 01:06:50,381
He took it out, went to the telephone
and made a long-distance call.

783
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:53,175
He had his wife's jewelry in the handbag.

784
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,301
Seemed worried about it.

785
01:06:54,386 --> 01:06:56,178
Asked somebody's advice over the telephone.

786
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:57,888
Someone not his wife.

787
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:00,140
Well, I never saw him ask her for advice.

788
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:04,061
She volunteered plenty, but I
never saw him ask her for any.

789
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:15,823
I wonder where he's going.

790
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:17,241
I don't know.

791
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:19,702
Suppose he doesn't come back again?

792
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:22,413
He'll be back. His things are still there.

793
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:25,583
Well, I guess it's safe
to put on some lights now.

794
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,126
No, not yet!

795
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:38,554
Okay, you can turn it on now. He must
have gone someplace to the right.

796
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:43,016
All day long, I've been trying
to keep my mind on my work.

797
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:44,727
Thinking about Thorwald?

798
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:46,979
And you and your friend, Doyle.

799
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,481
Did you hear from him
again, since he left?

800
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:50,566
Not a word.

801
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:53,235
He said he was gonna check the
railroad station and the trunk.

802
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,195
He must be still at it.

803
01:07:55,864 --> 01:07:57,823
Something on your mind?

804
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:00,075
It doesn't make sense to me.

805
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,618
What doesn't?

806
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:04,496
Women aren't that unpredictable.

807
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:05,998
Mmm.

808
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:09,209
Well, I can't guess
what you're thinking.

809
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:11,670
A woman has a favorite handbag

810
01:08:11,755 --> 01:08:15,883
and it always hangs on her bedpost,
where she can get at it easily.

811
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:19,970
And then, all of a sudden, she goes away
on a trip and leaves it behind. Why?

812
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:21,722
Because she didn't know
she was going on a trip.

813
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:23,886
And where she's going, she
wouldn't need the handbag.

814
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:26,769
Yes, but only her husband
would know that.

815
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:29,271
And that jewelry.

816
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,148
Women don't keep their
jewelry in a purse

817
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:33,734
getting all twisted and
scratched and tangled up.

818
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:35,402
Well, do they hide it in
their husband's clothes?

819
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:37,070
They do not.

820
01:08:37,155 --> 01:08:39,865
And they don't leave
it behind, either.

821
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:42,326
Why, a woman going
anywhere but the hospital

822
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:45,412
would always take makeup,
perfume and jewelry.

823
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:48,874
Put that over there.
That's inside stuff, huh?

824
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,584
It's basic equipment.

825
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:53,545
And you don't leave it behind
in your husband's drawer

826
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,088
in your favorite handbag.

827
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:57,466
Well, I'm with you,
sweetie. I'm with you.

828
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:59,510
Tom Doyle has a pat
answer for that, though.

829
01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:01,553
That Mrs. Thorwald
left at 6:00 a.m.

830
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:02,721
Yesterday with her husband?

831
01:09:02,806 --> 01:09:04,473
According to those witnesses.

832
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,809
Well, I have a pat
rebuttal for Mr. Doyle.

833
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:10,729
That couldn't have been Mrs.
Thorwald, or I don't know women.

834
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:12,856
What about the witnesses?

835
01:09:12,941 --> 01:09:15,192
We'll agree they saw a woman,

836
01:09:15,735 --> 01:09:17,986
but she was not
Mrs. Thorwald.

837
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:20,656
That is, not yet.

838
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:21,740
Is that so?

839
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:27,329
Come here.

840
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:34,169
I'd like to see your friend's
face when we tell him.

841
01:09:34,254 --> 01:09:36,463
He doesn't sound like
much of a detective.

842
01:09:36,548 --> 01:09:40,008
Oh, don't be too hard on him.
He's a steady worker.

843
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:43,595
I sure wish he'd show up.

844
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,265
Don't rush him.
We have all night.

845
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:50,894
- We have all what?
- Night.

846
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:53,605
I'm going to stay with you.

847
01:09:55,567 --> 01:09:58,819
Well, you'll have to clear
that with my landlord.

848
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:01,947
I have the whole weekend off.

849
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:05,826
That's very nice, but
I just have one bed.

850
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:10,163
If you say anything else, I'll
stay tomorrow night, too.

851
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:14,126
I won't be able to
give you any pajamas.

852
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:22,676
You said I'll have to
live out of one suitcase.

853
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:27,097
I'll bet yours isn't this small.

854
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:28,807
This is a suitcase?

855
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:31,810
Well, a Mark Cross
overnight case, anyway.

856
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:35,397
Compact, but ample enough.

857
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:37,733
Looks like you
packed in a hurry.

858
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:40,319
Look at this.
Isn't that amazing?

859
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:42,779
I'll trade you...

860
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:45,949
My feminine intuition
for a bed for the night.

861
01:10:46,034 --> 01:10:48,118
I'll go along with that.

862
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:04,051
There's that song again.

863
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:14,353
Where does a man get inspiration
to write a song like that?

864
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:17,522
Well, he gets it from the
landlady once a month.

865
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,569
It's utterly beautiful.

866
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:25,072
I wish I could be creative.

867
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:26,865
Oh, sweetie, you are.

868
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:31,286
You have a great talent for
creating difficult situations.

869
01:11:31,371 --> 01:11:32,663
- I do?
- Sure.

870
01:11:32,747 --> 01:11:35,123
Like staying here
all night uninvited.

871
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:38,543
Surprise is the most
important element of attack.

872
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:41,755
And besides, you're not up on
your private eye literature.

873
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:43,966
When they're in trouble, it's
always their Girl Friday

874
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:45,384
who gets them out of it.

875
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:47,636
Is she the girl that saves
them from the clutches

876
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,179
of the seductive showgirls

877
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:51,473
and the over-passionate
daughters of the rich?

878
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:53,642
The same.
That's the one, huh?

879
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:57,479
It's funny. He never ends
up marrying her, does he?

880
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:58,730
That's strange.

881
01:11:58,815 --> 01:11:59,940
Weird.

882
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:05,278
Why don't I slip into
something more comfortable?

883
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:07,072
By all means.

884
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:09,992
I mean, like the kitchen
and make us some coffee.

885
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:12,577
Oh, and some brandy, too, huh?

886
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:23,672
Harry.

887
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:34,474
- Jeff.
- Hi.

888
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:28,737
What else have you got
on this man Thorwald?

889
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:32,240
Well, enough to scare me you wouldn't
show up in time and we'd lose him.

890
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:33,283
Think he's getting out of here?

891
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:34,826
Look, he's got
everything he owns

892
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:38,497
laid out over there in the
bedroom, waiting to be packed.

893
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:44,002
I'm just warming some brandy.
Mr. Doyle, I presume?

894
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:48,757
Tom, this is Miss Lisa Fremont.

895
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:49,841
How do you do?

896
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:52,886
We think Thorwald's guilty.

897
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,520
Careful, Tom.

898
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:08,065
- Hello.
<i>- Lieutenant Doyle.</i>

899
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:10,487
Yeah, he's right here. For you.

900
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:13,406
- Hello.
<i>- Lieutenant Doyle, sir?</i>

901
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:14,783
Speaking.

902
01:14:15,827 --> 01:14:17,160
Yeah.

903
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:20,539
All right.

904
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:23,125
I see. Thank you. Goodbye.

905
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:25,794
Coffee will be ready soon.

906
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:28,630
Jeff, aren't you going to
tell him about the jewelry?

907
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:29,756
Jewelry?

908
01:14:29,841 --> 01:14:33,218
He's got his wife's jewelry hidden in
his clothes in the bedroom over there.

909
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:34,427
You sure it belonged to his wife?

910
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:36,555
It was in her favorite handbag.

911
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:39,307
Mr. Doyle, that can only
lead to one conclusion.

912
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:40,433
Namely?

913
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:44,479
That it was not Mrs. Thorwald that
left with him yesterday morning.

914
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:45,981
You figured that out, eh?

915
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:48,525
Well, it's simply that women
don't leave their jewelry behind

916
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:50,610
when they go on a trip.

917
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:51,903
Come on, come on, Tom.

918
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:55,615
Now you don't really need any
of this information, do you?

919
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:03,748
As a matter of fact, I don't.

920
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:12,924
Lars Thorwald is no more
a murderer than I am.

921
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:19,514
You mean to say you can explain
everything that's gone on over there,

922
01:15:19,599 --> 01:15:20,891
and is still going on?

923
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:22,851
No, neither can you.

924
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:25,937
That's a secret, private world
you're looking into out there.

925
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:29,062
People do a lot of things in private they
couldn't possibly explain in public.

926
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:30,942
Like disposing of their wives?

927
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:33,778
You get that idea out of your mind.
It'll only lead in the wrong direction.

928
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:36,323
What about the
knife and the saw?

929
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:37,991
Did you ever own a saw?

930
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:40,744
Well, at home in
the garage I had...

931
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:43,121
How many people
did you cut up with it?

932
01:15:43,206 --> 01:15:47,626
Or with the couple of hundred knives
you've probably owned in your lifetime?

933
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,045
Well, your logic is backward.

934
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:54,007
You can't ignore the wife disappearing
and the trunk and the jewelry.

935
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:56,843
I checked the railroad station.
He bought a ticket.

936
01:15:56,928 --> 01:15:58,887
Ten minutes later, he put
his wife on a train.

937
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:02,098
Destination, Merritsville.
The witnesses are that deep.

938
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:05,227
That might have been a woman, but it
couldn't have been Mrs. Thorwald.

939
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:06,853
- That jewelry...
- Look, Miss Fremont.

940
01:16:06,938 --> 01:16:09,731
That feminine intuition
stuff sells magazines.

941
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,776
But in real life,
it's still a fairy tale.

942
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:14,620
I don't know how many
wasted years I've spent

943
01:16:14,654 --> 01:16:17,239
tracking down leads based
on female intuition.

944
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:19,950
All right. I take it you
didn't find the trunk,

945
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:23,536
and all this is from an old speech you
once made at the Policemen's Ball.

946
01:16:23,621 --> 01:16:26,122
I found the trunk a half-hour
after I left here.

947
01:16:26,207 --> 01:16:29,876
I suppose it's normal for a man to
tie up a trunk with heavy rope?

948
01:16:29,961 --> 01:16:31,962
Well, if the lock
is broken, yes.

949
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:35,173
And what did you find inside the trunk?
A surly note to me?

950
01:16:35,258 --> 01:16:37,342
Mrs. Thorwald's clothes.

951
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:40,845
Clean, well packed.
Not stylish, but presentable.

952
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,764
Didn't you take them
off to the crime lab?

953
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:45,725
I sent them on their
merry and legal way.

954
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:48,603
Why, when a woman is taking
a simple, short trip,

955
01:16:48,688 --> 01:16:50,605
does she take
everything she owns?

956
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:54,401
Let's let the female psychology
department handle that one.

957
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:57,821
I would say it looked as
if she wasn't coming back.

958
01:16:57,905 --> 01:16:59,614
That's what's known
as a family problem.

959
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:02,534
And if she wasn't coming back,
why didn't he tell his landlord?

960
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:07,414
I'll tell you why he didn't tell his
landlord. Because he was hiding something.

961
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:12,002
Do you tell your
landlord everything?

962
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:13,795
I told you to be careful, Tom.

963
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:17,080
Look, if I'd have been careful piloting
that reconnaissance plane during the war,

964
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:18,633
you wouldn't have had the
chance to take the pictures

965
01:17:18,718 --> 01:17:23,138
that won you a medal, and a
good job, and fame and money.

966
01:17:25,433 --> 01:17:30,020
What do you say we all sit down and
have a nice, friendly drink, too? Hmm?

967
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:32,731
Forget all about this.

968
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:36,985
We can tell lies about the
good old days during the war.

969
01:17:37,945 --> 01:17:40,030
You mean you're through
with the case?

970
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:42,949
There is no case to be
through with, Miss Fremont.

971
01:17:43,034 --> 01:17:44,909
How about that drink?

972
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,627
Yeah, I guess you're right.

973
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:59,257
Well, I think I better get
home and get some sleep.

974
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,260
Cheers.

975
01:18:06,724 --> 01:18:08,808
Not much of a snifter.

976
01:18:13,564 --> 01:18:16,191
Oh, Jeff, if you
need any more help...

977
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:19,778
Consult the Yellow Pages
in your telephone directory.

978
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:23,114
Oh, I love funny exiting lines.

979
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,867
Who was that trunk addressed to?

980
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:27,410
Mrs. Anna Thorwald.

981
01:18:27,495 --> 01:18:30,038
Well, then let's wait and
find out who picks it up.

982
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:32,540
Oh, that telephone call.
I gave them your number.

983
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:33,958
I hope you don't mind.

984
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:35,543
Depends on who they were.

985
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:37,212
The police at Merritsville.

986
01:18:37,296 --> 01:18:39,464
They reported the trunk
was just picked up

987
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,508
by Mrs. Anna Thorwald.

988
01:18:42,426 --> 01:18:44,844
Don't stay up too late.

989
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:05,073
- Look.
- What?

990
01:19:37,064 --> 01:19:39,649
Yeah, he's kind of young, isn't he?

991
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:17,270
What are you doing?

992
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:48,218
You know, much as I hate to give Thomas J.
Doyle too much credit,

993
01:20:48,302 --> 01:20:50,595
he might have gotten a hold
of something when he said

994
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:53,848
that was pretty private
stuff going on out there.

995
01:20:55,601 --> 01:21:00,772
I wonder if it's ethical to watch a man
with binoculars and a long-focus lens.

996
01:21:02,608 --> 01:21:05,527
Do you... Do you
suppose it's ethical,

997
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:08,780
even if you prove that he
didn't commit a crime?

998
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:13,034
I'm not much on
rear-window ethics.

999
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:14,702
Of course, they can
do the same thing to me.

1000
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:18,289
Watch me like a bug under
a glass, if they want to.

1001
01:21:18,374 --> 01:21:21,876
Jeff, you know, if someone came in here,
they wouldn't believe what they'd see.

1002
01:21:21,961 --> 01:21:22,961
What?

1003
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:24,254
You and me with long faces.

1004
01:21:24,338 --> 01:21:28,841
Plunged into despair because we find
out a man didn't kill his wife.

1005
01:21:28,926 --> 01:21:32,387
We're two of the most frightening
ghouls I've ever known.

1006
01:21:32,471 --> 01:21:37,433
You'd think we could be a little bit happy
that the poor woman is alive and well.

1007
01:21:39,979 --> 01:21:43,314
Whatever happened to that old
saying, "Love thy neighbor"?

1008
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:48,361
You know, I think I'll start
reviving that tomorrow.

1009
01:21:49,572 --> 01:21:51,990
Yeah, I'll begin
with Miss Torso.

1010
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:56,703
Not if I have to move into
an apartment across the way

1011
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:01,499
and do the Dance of the
Seven Veils every hour.

1012
01:22:04,461 --> 01:22:06,462
Show's over for tonight.

1013
01:22:11,594 --> 01:22:13,928
Preview of coming attractions.

1014
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:19,058
Did Mr. Doyle think
I stole this case?

1015
01:22:20,519 --> 01:22:23,396
No, Lisa, I don't think he did.

1016
01:22:38,412 --> 01:22:40,330
What do you think?

1017
01:22:40,414 --> 01:22:41,414
Well...

1018
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:44,751
I will rephrase the question.

1019
01:22:44,835 --> 01:22:46,085
Thank you.

1020
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:48,755
Do you like it?

1021
01:22:49,548 --> 01:22:50,923
Yes, I like it.

1022
01:22:51,592 --> 01:22:53,968
Well...

1023
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:04,312
What's the matter?

1024
01:23:07,066 --> 01:23:09,108
- Somebody's hurt?
- It's the dog.

1025
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:11,694
Something's happened to the dog.

1026
01:23:14,448 --> 01:23:17,659
What's the trouble?
Somebody fall out a window?

1027
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:20,620
See, it's a dog down there.

1028
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:22,955
It's dead.

1029
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:26,376
It's been strangled.
The neck is broken.

1030
01:23:27,211 --> 01:23:29,003
Which one of you did it?

1031
01:23:29,088 --> 01:23:31,506
Which one of you killed my dog?

1032
01:23:33,217 --> 01:23:36,010
You don't know the meaning
of the word "Neighbors."

1033
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:40,056
Neighbors like each other,
speak to each other,

1034
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,475
care if anybody lives or dies.

1035
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:44,977
But none of you do!

1036
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:51,359
But I couldn't imagine
any of you being so low

1037
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:54,821
that you'd kill a little
helpless, friendly dog.

1038
01:23:56,990 --> 01:24:00,868
The only thing in this whole
neighborhood who liked anybody.

1039
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:11,921
Did you kill him
because he liked you?

1040
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:14,173
Just because he liked you?

1041
01:24:16,969 --> 01:24:18,636
Let's go inside.

1042
01:24:22,808 --> 01:24:25,727
Come on. Let's go back in.
It's only a dog.

1043
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:42,076
You know, for a minute, that Tom Doyle
almost had me convinced I was wrong.

1044
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:44,078
- But you're not?
- Look.

1045
01:24:44,163 --> 01:24:48,374
In the whole courtyard, only one
person didn't come to the window.

1046
01:24:48,459 --> 01:24:49,667
Look.

1047
01:24:55,048 --> 01:24:58,426
Why would Thorwald want
to kill a little dog?

1048
01:25:00,304 --> 01:25:02,305
Because it knew too much?

1049
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:13,399
You think this is worth
waiting all day to see?

1050
01:25:13,901 --> 01:25:15,443
Is he cleaning house?

1051
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:18,112
He's washing down
the bathroom walls.

1052
01:25:18,197 --> 01:25:19,238
Hmm.

1053
01:25:19,323 --> 01:25:21,449
Must have splattered a lot.

1054
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:25,703
Well, why not? That's
what we're all thinking.

1055
01:25:25,788 --> 01:25:28,668
He killed her in there, he has to clean
up those stains before he leaves.

1056
01:25:28,707 --> 01:25:31,375
Oh, Stella, your
choice of words.

1057
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:34,879
Nobody ever invented a polite
word for a killing yet.

1058
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:42,970
Lisa? Lisa, back there, on that shelf,
there's a little yellow box. You see it?

1059
01:25:43,055 --> 01:25:44,806
- Top one?
- Right on top, yeah.

1060
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:47,391
Bring it. And bring
me the viewer there.

1061
01:25:49,269 --> 01:25:50,853
I just got a...

1062
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:54,315
Now, these are
about two weeks old.

1063
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:58,069
I hope I took something else
besides leg art. Now which one...

1064
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:00,530
- What are you looking for?
- Here.

1065
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:04,200
There's something, and if I'm right,
I think I've solved a murder.

1066
01:26:04,284 --> 01:26:06,077
- Mrs. Thorwald?
- No.

1067
01:26:07,246 --> 01:26:09,288
No, the dog.

1068
01:26:10,457 --> 01:26:11,624
Uh-huh.

1069
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:14,710
I think I know why
Thorwald killed that dog.

1070
01:26:15,254 --> 01:26:18,381
Here, now you take a look.
Tell me what you see.

1071
01:26:18,715 --> 01:26:20,341
Now take it down.

1072
01:26:20,843 --> 01:26:24,470
Now look again. Now take it down.
You see?

1073
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:28,140
But it's just a picture
of the backyard, that's all.

1074
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:32,228
One important change.
One important change.

1075
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:36,274
Those flowers in
Thorwald's pet flower bed.

1076
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:39,277
You mean where the dog
was sniffing around?

1077
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:42,822
Where the dog was digging.
Now look at those flowers.

1078
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:46,993
Look, right? Those two
yellow zinnias on this end

1079
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:48,911
aren't as tall as they were.

1080
01:26:48,996 --> 01:26:52,331
Now, since when do flowers
grow shorter in two weeks?

1081
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:53,875
There's something buried there.

1082
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:55,668
Mrs. Thorwald.

1083
01:26:56,295 --> 01:26:59,547
You haven't spent much time
around cemeteries, have you?

1084
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:02,675
Mr. Thorwald could scarcely
put his wife's body

1085
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:05,720
in a plot of ground
about one foot square.

1086
01:27:05,804 --> 01:27:08,639
Unless, of course, he put
her in standing on end,

1087
01:27:08,724 --> 01:27:11,434
and then he wouldn't
need a knife and saw.

1088
01:27:11,518 --> 01:27:15,187
No, my idea is she's
scattered all over town.

1089
01:27:15,272 --> 01:27:17,565
- Leg in the East River...
- Oh, Stella, please!

1090
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:19,066
No, no, no. There's
something in there.

1091
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:21,736
Those flowers have been
taken out and put back in.

1092
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:23,696
Maybe it's the knife and saw.
Yeah.

1093
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:24,822
Call Lieutenant Doyle.

1094
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:26,073
No, let's wait.

1095
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:29,911
Let's wait till it gets a little darker,
and I'll go over there and dig them up.

1096
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:33,998
You'll go? You won't dig anything
up and get your neck broken.

1097
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:36,292
No, no, we've...

1098
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:40,129
We're not gonna call Doyle until I
can produce Mrs. Thorwald's body.

1099
01:27:40,213 --> 01:27:43,049
What we've got to do is find a
way to get into that apartment.

1100
01:27:43,133 --> 01:27:44,592
He's packing.

1101
01:27:45,844 --> 01:27:46,969
Uh-oh.

1102
01:27:47,054 --> 01:27:49,347
Here, get me a pencil.

1103
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:53,559
Stella, get me some note paper.
It's up here someplace.

1104
01:27:53,644 --> 01:27:55,186
There it is.

1105
01:29:11,847 --> 01:29:14,682
You did it, Thorwald.
You did it.

1106
01:29:18,729 --> 01:29:19,812
Look out, Lisa.
He's coming.

1107
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:21,981
You never should have let her do it.
If he ever...

1108
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:23,357
Look. Look. Look.

1109
01:29:43,295 --> 01:29:45,713
Well, thank heaven that's over.

1110
01:29:48,967 --> 01:29:49,925
All right if I have a drink?

1111
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:51,594
Sure, go ahead.

1112
01:30:00,145 --> 01:30:04,065
There's no doubt about it. He's leaving.
It's just a question of when.

1113
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:06,817
Mind if I use that
portable keyhole?

1114
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:11,989
Go ahead, just as long as you
tell me what you're looking at.

1115
01:30:17,996 --> 01:30:18,996
I wonder...

1116
01:30:19,081 --> 01:30:20,206
Wonder what?

1117
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:22,166
Miss Lonelyheart's
just laid out something

1118
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:24,877
that looks like rhodium
tri-eckonal capsules.

1119
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:26,253
You can tell from here?

1120
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:29,298
I've handled enough of those red
pills to put everybody in Hackensack

1121
01:30:29,382 --> 01:30:30,674
to sleep for the winter.

1122
01:30:30,759 --> 01:30:32,426
Well, does she have
enough of them to...

1123
01:30:32,511 --> 01:30:34,512
No. It will make
the rest easy to...

1124
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:37,014
Wasn't that close?

1125
01:30:37,641 --> 01:30:40,768
What was his reaction. I mean,
when he looked at the note?

1126
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:44,772
Well, it wasn't the kind of an expression
that would get him a quick loan at the bank.

1127
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:46,690
Jeff, the handbag!

1128
01:31:12,008 --> 01:31:14,343
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's
wedding ring

1129
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:17,429
is among the jewelry
he has in that handbag?

1130
01:31:17,514 --> 01:31:20,099
Now, during the phone conversation
he held up three rings.

1131
01:31:20,183 --> 01:31:23,519
One with a diamond, one with
a big stone of some sort

1132
01:31:23,603 --> 01:31:25,479
and then just a plain gold band.

1133
01:31:25,564 --> 01:31:29,650
And the last thing she would leave
behind would be a wedding ring.

1134
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:31,944
Stella, do you ever
leave yours at home?

1135
01:31:32,028 --> 01:31:36,490
The only way anybody could get that
ring would be to chop off my finger.

1136
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:42,663
Let's go down and find out
what's buried in the garden.

1137
01:31:42,747 --> 01:31:47,126
Why not? I've always wanted to meet Mrs.
Thorwald.

1138
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:48,836
- What are you two talking about?
- You got a shovel?

1139
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,171
A shovel? Of course I
don't have a shovel.

1140
01:31:50,255 --> 01:31:52,047
There's probably
one in the basement.

1141
01:31:52,132 --> 01:31:54,175
Jeff, if you're squeamish,
just don't look.

1142
01:31:54,259 --> 01:31:55,551
Squeamish?
I'm not squeamish.

1143
01:31:55,635 --> 01:31:59,180
I just don't want you two to end up
like that dog ended up. That's all.

1144
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:02,516
Oh, you know, Miss Fremont, he
might just have something there.

1145
01:32:02,601 --> 01:32:04,685
Just hold on.
Here, take this.

1146
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:07,104
No sense taking any
chances in this thing.

1147
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:09,440
Here, give me the phone book.

1148
01:32:10,609 --> 01:32:11,859
What for?

1149
01:32:12,611 --> 01:32:14,570
Maybe I can get him
out of that apartment.

1150
01:32:14,654 --> 01:32:16,155
We only need a few minutes.

1151
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:17,948
I'll see if I can
get about 15 minutes.

1152
01:32:18,033 --> 01:32:19,074
How?

1153
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:20,159
Thorwald.

1154
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:24,622
Thorwald...
Thorwald...

1155
01:32:26,082 --> 01:32:29,418
Chelsea 27099.

1156
01:32:30,337 --> 01:32:31,879
27099.

1157
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:35,132
We scared him once, maybe
we can scare him again.

1158
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:38,886
Well, I guess I'm using that
word "we" a little freely.

1159
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:40,930
I mean, you're taking
all the chances.

1160
01:32:41,014 --> 01:32:42,932
Shall we vote him in, Stella?

1161
01:32:43,016 --> 01:32:44,058
Unanimously.

1162
01:32:44,142 --> 01:32:46,435
27099. Look out.

1163
01:32:49,731 --> 01:32:54,401
Chelsea.

1164
01:33:12,379 --> 01:33:14,588
Go on, pick it up, Thorwald.

1165
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:17,466
Go on, you're curious.

1166
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:21,595
You wonder if it's your girlfriend
calling, the one you killed for.

1167
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,347
Go on, pick it up.

1168
01:33:27,644 --> 01:33:28,811
<i>Hello?</i>

1169
01:33:29,771 --> 01:33:31,647
Did you get my note?

1170
01:33:33,692 --> 01:33:35,901
Well, did you get it, Thorwald?

1171
01:33:35,986 --> 01:33:37,152
<i>Who are you?</i>

1172
01:33:37,237 --> 01:33:39,446
I'll give you a
chance to find out.

1173
01:33:39,531 --> 01:33:42,283
Meet me in the bar
at the Albert Hotel.

1174
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:44,118
Do it right away.

1175
01:33:44,202 --> 01:33:45,786
<i>Why should I?</i>

1176
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:47,413
A little business meeting...

1177
01:33:48,164 --> 01:33:50,874
To settle the estate
of your late wife.

1178
01:33:51,293 --> 01:33:54,920
<i>I don't know what you mean.</i>

1179
01:33:55,005 --> 01:33:59,425
Come on. Quit stalling, Thorwald, or
I'll hang up and call the police.

1180
01:33:59,759 --> 01:34:01,677
<i>I have only $100 or so.</i>

1181
01:34:01,761 --> 01:34:03,053
That's a start.

1182
01:34:03,555 --> 01:34:07,224
I'm at the Albert now.
I'll be looking for you.

1183
01:34:26,703 --> 01:34:28,329
Come on, Stella, let's go.

1184
01:34:28,413 --> 01:34:29,997
One of you keep an
eye on this window.

1185
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:33,667
If I see him coming back,
I'll signal with a flashbulb.

1186
01:36:08,179 --> 01:36:09,847
<i>This is the Doyle residence.</i>

1187
01:36:09,931 --> 01:36:14,143
Hello, this is L.B. Jefferies speaking.
I'm a friend of Mr. Doyle.

1188
01:36:14,436 --> 01:36:15,436
Who's this?

1189
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,645
<i>This is a babysitter.</i>

1190
01:36:16,729 --> 01:36:18,188
Oh. Uh...

1191
01:36:18,273 --> 01:36:19,523
When do you expect them in?

1192
01:36:19,607 --> 01:36:24,153
<i>Well, I'm hired till 1:00. They went
to dinner and maybe a nightclub.</i>

1193
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:25,863
I see.

1194
01:36:26,364 --> 01:36:29,992
If he calls in, would you have him get
in touch with L.B. Jefferies right away?

1195
01:36:30,076 --> 01:36:31,994
I might have quite a surprise for him.

1196
01:36:32,078 --> 01:36:34,997
<i>Well, do we have your number, Mr.
Jefferies?</i>

1197
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:37,207
He has it. Good night.

1198
01:36:37,292 --> 01:36:38,750
<i>Good night.</i>

1199
01:36:56,728 --> 01:36:59,521
Stella was wrong about Miss Lonelyheart.

1200
01:37:31,387 --> 01:37:33,805
Lisa, what are you... Don't do...

1201
01:37:49,948 --> 01:37:52,616
Lisa, what are you doing? Don't go...

1202
01:38:26,442 --> 01:38:29,069
Come on, come on! Get out of there!

1203
01:38:35,326 --> 01:38:39,204
She said ring Thorwald's phone the
second you see him come back.

1204
01:38:39,289 --> 01:38:40,247
I'm gonna ring it right now!

1205
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:43,083
Oh, no. Give her another minute.

1206
01:38:46,337 --> 01:38:48,922
All right, fellows, let's try
it once from the beginning.

1207
01:38:49,007 --> 01:38:50,757
Miss Lonelyheart.

1208
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:52,718
Oh, call the police!

1209
01:38:55,096 --> 01:38:56,096
<i>Operator.</i>

1210
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:58,265
Get me the police, sixth precinct.

1211
01:38:58,349 --> 01:38:59,683
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1212
01:39:11,863 --> 01:39:14,573
Mr. Jefferies, the music stopped her.

1213
01:39:22,081 --> 01:39:23,790
What... Lisa!

1214
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:27,377
Lisa!

1215
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,349
<i>Precinct 6, Sergeant Allgood.</i>

1216
01:39:40,433 --> 01:39:45,604
Hello. Hello. Look, a man is assaulting
a woman at 125 West 9th Street.

1217
01:39:45,688 --> 01:39:49,232
Second floor, at the rear. Make it fast!

1218
01:39:49,317 --> 01:39:50,317
<i>Your name?</i>

1219
01:39:50,401 --> 01:39:52,027
L.B. Jefferies.

1220
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:53,111
<i>Phone number?</i>

1221
01:39:53,196 --> 01:39:55,489
Chelsea 25598.

1222
01:40:16,094 --> 01:40:17,761
The door was open.

1223
01:40:39,784 --> 01:40:41,827
I told you... Oh, no!

1224
01:40:43,705 --> 01:40:45,706
Let go of me! Jeff!

1225
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:46,998
Oh, no!

1226
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:48,625
Jeff! Jeff!

1227
01:40:49,127 --> 01:40:50,210
Jeff!

1228
01:40:51,754 --> 01:40:52,963
Lisa!

1229
01:40:53,965 --> 01:40:56,550
Stella, what do we do?

1230
01:40:56,634 --> 01:40:57,843
Jeff!

1231
01:40:58,636 --> 01:41:00,887
- Jeff!
- Well, here they come.

1232
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:53,148
What's she trying to do? Why
doesn't she turn him in?

1233
01:41:53,232 --> 01:41:54,566
She's a smart girl.

1234
01:41:54,650 --> 01:41:56,290
"Smart girl"? She'll
get herself arrested.

1235
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:59,029
It'll get her out
of there, won't it?

1236
01:42:01,699 --> 01:42:03,617
Look, the wedding ring!

1237
01:42:09,415 --> 01:42:11,875
Turn off the light!
He's seen us!

1238
01:42:21,803 --> 01:42:23,470
How long do you think he'll stay there?

1239
01:42:23,554 --> 01:42:27,641
Well, unless he's dumber than I think he
is, he won't wait until his lease is up.

1240
01:42:27,725 --> 01:42:29,805
Get my billfold out of the
drawer in the table there.

1241
01:42:29,811 --> 01:42:31,019
What do you need money for?

1242
01:42:31,103 --> 01:42:32,687
I'm gonna bail Lisa out of jail.

1243
01:42:32,772 --> 01:42:35,106
You know, you could leave her
there till next Tuesday,

1244
01:42:35,191 --> 01:42:37,651
then you could sneak
safely away as planned.

1245
01:42:37,735 --> 01:42:41,655
Yeah, let's
see. $127.

1246
01:42:41,739 --> 01:42:42,781
How much do you need?

1247
01:42:42,865 --> 01:42:46,284
Well, this is first-offense
burglary, that's about $250.

1248
01:42:46,369 --> 01:42:48,245
- Lisa's handbag.
- Yeah.

1249
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:50,664
How much does she have?

1250
01:42:50,748 --> 01:42:52,040
Fifty cents.

1251
01:42:52,124 --> 01:42:53,333
Here, take this.

1252
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:55,335
Look, I got $20 or so
in my purse.

1253
01:42:55,419 --> 01:42:56,837
What about the rest?
What about the rest?

1254
01:42:56,921 --> 01:42:59,464
When those cops see Lisa,
they'll even contribute.

1255
01:42:59,549 --> 01:43:00,841
Well, hurry up.

1256
01:43:05,096 --> 01:43:07,430
Just a minute.
Hurry up!

1257
01:43:08,099 --> 01:43:09,099
Jefferies.

1258
01:43:09,183 --> 01:43:10,851
<i>All right. What is it now?</i>

1259
01:43:10,935 --> 01:43:14,104
Doyle, I've got something
really big for you.

1260
01:43:14,188 --> 01:43:16,106
<i>Why did I have to return your call?</i>

1261
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:19,401
<i>Look, Jeff! Don't louse up my
night with another mad killer...</i>

1262
01:43:19,485 --> 01:43:24,072
Listen to me! Listen to me! Lisa's in jail.
She got arrested.

1263
01:43:24,448 --> 01:43:26,157
<i>- Your Lisa?</i>
- My Lisa.

1264
01:43:26,242 --> 01:43:30,078
Boy, you should have seen her. She
got into Thorwald's apartment.

1265
01:43:30,162 --> 01:43:33,331
But then he came back, and the only way I
could get her out was to call the police.

1266
01:43:33,416 --> 01:43:35,041
<i>- I told you...</i>
- I know you told me!

1267
01:43:35,126 --> 01:43:38,211
She went in to get evidence and
she came out with evidence.

1268
01:43:38,296 --> 01:43:39,921
- Like what?
<i>- Like what?</i>

1269
01:43:40,006 --> 01:43:42,924
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring.
That's like what.

1270
01:43:43,009 --> 01:43:46,803
If that woman was alive, she'd
be wearing that ring. Right?

1271
01:43:47,972 --> 01:43:50,015
<i>- A possibility.</i>
- A possibility. It's a fact!

1272
01:43:50,099 --> 01:43:54,102
He killed a dog last night because the
dog was scratching around in the garden.

1273
01:43:54,186 --> 01:43:58,356
You know why? Because he had something
buried in that garden that the dog scented.

1274
01:43:58,441 --> 01:43:59,566
<i>Like an old ham bone?</i>

1275
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:02,736
Look, I don't know what pet names
Thorwald had for his wife,

1276
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:04,195
but I'll tell you this,

1277
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:07,532
all those trips at night
with that metal suitcase,

1278
01:44:07,617 --> 01:44:09,242
he wasn't taking
out his possessions,

1279
01:44:09,327 --> 01:44:12,746
because his possessions
are still up in the apartment.

1280
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:14,497
<i>Perhaps it was old "ham bone".</i>

1281
01:44:14,582 --> 01:44:16,207
Yeah, in sections.

1282
01:44:16,292 --> 01:44:17,626
And I'll tell you
something else.

1283
01:44:17,710 --> 01:44:20,795
All the telephone calls he made
were long distance, all right?

1284
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:24,633
Now, if he called his wife long
distance on the day she left,

1285
01:44:24,717 --> 01:44:26,927
after she arrived
in Merritsville,

1286
01:44:27,011 --> 01:44:30,263
why did she write a card to him saying
that she'd arrived in Merritsville?

1287
01:44:30,348 --> 01:44:32,182
Why did she do that?

1288
01:44:32,934 --> 01:44:34,184
<i>Where'd they take Lisa?</i>

1289
01:44:34,268 --> 01:44:35,268
Precinct 6.

1290
01:44:35,353 --> 01:44:36,686
I sent somebody over
with the bail money.

1291
01:44:36,771 --> 01:44:38,188
<i>Maybe you won't need it.</i>

1292
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:39,272
<i>I'll run it down, Jeff.</i>

1293
01:44:39,357 --> 01:44:41,441
All right. All right.
Now hurry up, will you?

1294
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:43,360
This fellow knows
he's being watched.

1295
01:44:43,444 --> 01:44:45,278
He's not gonna wait around forever.
Hurry up.

1296
01:44:45,363 --> 01:44:47,364
<i>If that ring checks out,
we'll give him an escort.</i>

1297
01:44:47,448 --> 01:44:49,574
<i>- So long, Jeff.</i>
- So long.

1298
01:44:57,708 --> 01:45:01,544
Hello. Hello. Tom, I think Thorwald's left.
I don't see...

1299
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:05,632
Hello...

1300
01:47:37,451 --> 01:47:39,452
What do you want from me?

1301
01:47:43,374 --> 01:47:45,458
Your friend, the girl,
could have turned me in.

1302
01:47:45,543 --> 01:47:47,085
Why didn't she?

1303
01:47:49,213 --> 01:47:53,007
What is it you want? A lot of money?
I don't have any money.

1304
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:58,304
Say something.

1305
01:48:00,057 --> 01:48:02,976
Say something! Tell me what you want!

1306
01:48:06,105 --> 01:48:08,356
Can you get me that ring back?

1307
01:48:09,525 --> 01:48:10,984
No.

1308
01:48:11,068 --> 01:48:12,902
Tell her to bring it back!

1309
01:48:12,987 --> 01:48:15,113
I can't. The police have it by now.

1310
01:48:52,276 --> 01:48:54,110
Lisa! Doyle!

1311
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:03,953
Over there!

1312
01:49:09,793 --> 01:49:12,295
Look! Look, over
in that apartment!

1313
01:49:31,315 --> 01:49:32,649
Doyle!

1314
01:49:36,737 --> 01:49:38,821
Creele! Give me your.38!

1315
01:49:49,833 --> 01:49:51,584
I'm sorry, Jeff. I got
here as fast as I could!

1316
01:49:51,669 --> 01:49:53,419
Oh, Mr. Jefferies! Don't
let anybody touch him.

1317
01:49:53,504 --> 01:49:55,380
Get my medical
bag from upstairs.

1318
01:49:55,464 --> 01:49:57,590
Oh, Lisa, sweetie, if anything
had happened to you...

1319
01:49:57,675 --> 01:49:59,425
Oh, shut up. I'm all right.

1320
01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:01,469
Gee, I'm proud of you!

1321
01:50:02,513 --> 01:50:04,889
You got enough for
a search warrant now?

1322
01:50:04,974 --> 01:50:06,140
Oh, yeah, sure.

1323
01:50:06,225 --> 01:50:08,268
- Lieutenant Doyle!
- Yeah?

1324
01:50:08,352 --> 01:50:09,435
Is he okay?

1325
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,561
He's alive.

1326
01:50:10,646 --> 01:50:14,190
Thorwald's ready to take us
on a tour of the East River.

1327
01:50:19,530 --> 01:50:21,698
Did he say what was
buried in the flower bed?

1328
01:50:21,782 --> 01:50:25,910
Yeah. He said the dog got too
inquisitive, so he dug it up.

1329
01:50:26,537 --> 01:50:29,372
It's in a hat box
over in his apartment.

1330
01:50:29,873 --> 01:50:30,999
- Want to look?
- No, thanks.

1331
01:50:31,083 --> 01:50:33,293
I don't want any part of her.

1332
01:50:39,508 --> 01:50:42,302
I hope it's gonna be a hit.
This is the first release.

1333
01:50:42,386 --> 01:50:44,304
I'd love to hear it.

1334
01:50:44,388 --> 01:50:47,724
I can't tell you what this
music has meant to me.

1335
01:51:03,157 --> 01:51:05,199
Now, let's try it again, puppy.

1336
01:51:05,284 --> 01:51:07,493
Stay still. Stay.

1337
01:51:15,294 --> 01:51:16,753
- Stanley!
- Hi, baby!

1338
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:22,633
My, look what the Army's done for you!

1339
01:51:24,553 --> 01:51:28,598
The Army's made me hungry. What've
you got in the icebox to eat?

1340
01:51:29,266 --> 01:51:31,351
Boy, it's good to be home.

1341
01:51:34,772 --> 01:51:36,356
I don't care if
you help me or not,

1342
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:39,442
but if you'd told me you'd quit your
job, we wouldn't have gotten married.

1343
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:41,402
Oh, honey, come on...
