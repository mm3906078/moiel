1
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,915
I owe everything to George Bailey.

2
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:30,185
Help him, dear Father.

3
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:33,615
Joseph, Jesus and Mary,

4
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:36,320
help my friend Mr. Bailey.

5
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,390
Help my son George tonight.

6
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,200
He never thinks about himself, God.

7
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,963
That's why he's in trouble.

8
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,196
George is a good guy.

9
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,634
Give him a break, God.

10
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,833
I love him, dear Lord.

11
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,808
Watch over him tonight.

12
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,609
Please, God.

13
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,977
Something's the matter with Daddy.

14
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:58,346
Please bring Daddy back.

15
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,476
Please bring Daddy home.

16
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,782
Watch over him tonight.

17
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,453
Please bring Daddy back.

18
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,386
Hello, Joseph. Trouble?

19
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:14,092
Looks like we'll have
to send someone down.

20
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,260
A lot of people asking for help
for a man named George Bailey.

21
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,860
George Bailey?

22
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,440
Yes. Tonight's his crucial night.
You're right.

23
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,374
We'll have to send someone down
immediately. Whose turn is it?

24
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,775
That's why I came to see you, sir.

25
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,480
It's that clockmaker's turn again.

26
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:32,813
Oh, Clarence.
Hasn't got his wings yet, has he?

27
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,784
We've passed him up right along.

28
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:38,324
Because, you know, sir,
he's got the IQ of a rabbit.

29
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,860
Yes, but he's got
the faith of a child. Simple.

30
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,952
Joseph, send for Clarence.

31
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:48,991
You sent for me, sir?

32
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,037
Yes, Clarence.
A man down on Earth needs our help.

33
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,571
Splendid. Is he sick?

34
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,732
No, worse. He's discouraged.

35
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,402
At exactly 10:45 p.m. Earth time,

36
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,536
that man will be thinking seriously

37
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,581
of throwing away God's greatest gift.

38
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:06,277
Oh, dear, dear, his life?
Then I've only an hour to dress.

39
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,648
What are they wearing now?

40
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,085
You will spend that hour

41
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,816
getting acquainted with George Bailey.

42
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,893
Sir, if I should accomplish this mission,

43
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:17,429
I mean, might I perhaps win my wings?

44
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,964
I've been waiting
for over 200 years now, sir,

45
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,590
and people are beginning to talk.

46
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,168
What's that book you've got there?

47
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,396
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

48
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,871
Clarence, you do a good job
with George Bailey

49
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,271
and you'll get your wings.

50
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,104
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.

51
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,941
Poor George. Sit down.

52
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,173
Sit down? What are we...

53
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,942
If you're going to help a man,

54
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,382
you want to know something about him,
don't you?

55
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:40,952
Well, naturally, of course. I...

56
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,316
Now, keep your eyes open.

57
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,315
See the town?

58
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,086
Where? I don't see a thing.

59
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:50,026
Oh, I forgot.
You haven't got your wings yet.

60
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:53,030
Now, look, I'll help you out.
Concentrate.

61
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,529
Begin to see something?

62
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:58,297
Why, yes. This is amazing.

63
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,963
If you ever get your wings,
you'll see all by yourself.

64
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,803
Oh, wonderful.

65
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,605
Yay! Yippee!

66
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,680
Okay, boys, let's go.

67
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,441
Hey, who's that?

68
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,380
That's your problem. George Bailey.

69
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:12,508
A boy?

70
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,645
That's him when he was 12
back in 1919.

71
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,088
Something happens here
you'll have to remember later on.

72
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,521
Come on, Marty.

73
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,459
Let's go, Marty!

74
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,764
Attaboy, Marty.

75
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,291
Hee-haw!

76
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,335
Let's go, Sam. Hee-haw, Sammy!

77
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:35,541
Here comes the scare-baby,
my kid brother Harry Bailey.

78
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,337
I'm not scared.

79
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,843
Come on, Harry.

80
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,907
Let's go, Harry!

81
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,312
Come on, Harry!

82
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,542
Come on, Harry!

83
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,642
- Come on, Harry!
- Come on, Harry!

84
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,752
Help, George, help!

85
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:49,913
Help!

86
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,525
Don't worry, Harry. I'm coming!

87
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,888
- Help!
- Hang on, Harry!

88
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,461
- Help.
- Make a chain, gang.

89
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:01,032
George saved his brother's life that day,

90
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,800
but he caught a bad cold
which infected his left ear.

91
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,466
Cost him his hearing in that ear.

92
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,837
It was weeks
before he was able to go back

93
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:13,275
to his after-school job
at old man Gower's drugstore.

94
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,172
Mr. Potter.

95
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,545
Who's that, a king?

96
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,550
That's Henry F. Potter,

97
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,985
the richest and meanest man
in the county.

98
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,490
- Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

99
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,924
Go to work, slave.

100
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,126
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

101
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,570
Wish I had a million dollars.

102
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,432
Hot dog!

103
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,244
It's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey.

104
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,313
You're late.

105
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:48,675
Yes, sir.

106
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,321
Hello, George.

107
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,953
Hello, Mary.

108
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,618
Hello, Violet.

109
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,286
Two cents' worth of shoelaces?

110
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,727
She was here first.

111
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,662
I'm still thinking.

112
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,790
Shoelaces?

113
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,458
Please, Georgie.

114
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,128
I like him.

115
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,966
You like every boy.

116
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,699
What's wrong with that?

117
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,274
Here you are.

118
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,300
Help me down?

119
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,276
Help you down?

120
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,816
Made up your mind yet?

121
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,650
I'll take chocolate.

122
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,451
- With coconuts?
- I don't like coconuts.

123
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,487
You don't like coconuts?

124
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,991
Say, brainless, don't you know
where coconuts come from?

125
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,030
Lookit here.

126
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,297
From Tahiti, the Fiji islands,
the Coral Sea.

127
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,868
A new magazine. I never saw it before.

128
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,909
Of course you never.
Only us explorers can get it.

129
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,946
I've been nominated for membership
in the National Geographic Society.

130
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,416
Is this the ear you can't hear on?

131
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:02,215
George Bailey,
I'll love you till the day I die.

132
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,256
I'm going out exploring someday.
You watch.

133
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,589
And I'm gonna have a couple of harems
and maybe three or four wives.

134
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:09,888
Wait and see.

135
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:16,301
- George. George!
- Yes, sir?

136
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,836
You're not paid to be a canary.

137
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,434
No, sir.

138
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,735
Mr. Gower, do you want something?
Anything?

139
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,027
No.

140
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,366
- Anything I can do back here?
- No.

141
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,308
I'll get them, sir.

142
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,140
Quick, take those capsules
over to Mrs. Blaine.

143
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,576
She's waiting for them.

144
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:03,979
Yes, sir.

145
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,698
They have the diphtheria there,
haven't they, sir?

146
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:29,832
Yeah.

147
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,710
Is it a charge, sir?

148
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,376
Yes, George.

149
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,072
Mr. Gower, I...

150
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,581
- Oh, get going.
- Yes, sir.

151
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,271
Avast there, Captain Cook.
Where you heading?

152
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,813
- I've got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
- Some other time, George.

153
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,678
- It's important.
- There's a squall in there.

154
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,273
It's shaping up into a storm.

155
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,478
- Uncle Billy, telephone.
- Who is it?

156
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,817
- Bank examiner.
- Bank examiner?

157
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,117
I should have called him yesterday.

158
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,817
Switch it inside.

159
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,528
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.

160
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,461
Well, you're begging.
That's a whole lot worse.

161
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,329
All I'm asking for is 30 days more.

162
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,833
- Pop.
- Just a minute, Son.

163
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,598
Just 30 short days.
I'll dig up that $5,000 somehow.

164
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:33,967
- Shove me up, shove me up.
- Pop.

165
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,870
- Just a minute.
- Have you put any real pressure

166
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,409
on these people of yours
to pay those mortgages?

167
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,809
Times are bad, Mr. Potter.
A lot of these people are out of work.

168
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,971
Well, then, foreclose.

169
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,708
I can't do that.
These families have children.

170
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,340
- Pop.
- They're not my children.

171
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,351
But they're somebody's children,
Mr. Potter.

172
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,978
Are you running a business
or a charity ward?

173
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,182
- Well, all right...
- Not with my money.

174
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,851
Mr. Potter, what makes you
such a hard-skulled character?

175
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,792
You have no family, no children.

176
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,727
You can't begin
to spend all the money you've got.

177
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:02,062
I suppose I should give it
to miserable failures

178
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,404
like you and that idiot brother of yours
to spend for me.

179
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:06,665
He's not a failure!

180
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,570
- You can't say that about my father.
- George, George. Quiet, George.

181
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,006
You're not.
You're the biggest man in town...

182
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,600
- Run along, run along.
...bigger than him,

183
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,839
- bigger than everybody.
- Gives you an idea of the Baileys.

184
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,676
Don't let him say that about you, Pop.

185
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,409
All right, Son. All right. Thanks.

186
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,246
I'll talk to you tonight.

187
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,624
What?

188
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:32,027
Why, that medicine should have
been there an hour ago.

189
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,056
It will be over in five minutes,
Mrs. Blaine.

190
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,268
Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules?

191
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,966
I... You...

192
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,174
Didn't you hear what I said?

193
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,335
Yes, sir. I...

194
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,913
What kind of tricks
are you playing anyway?

195
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,679
Why didn't you deliver them right away?

196
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,276
Don't you know that boy's very sick?

197
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,855
You're hurting my sore ear.

198
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,514
You lazy loafer.

199
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,524
Mr. Gower,
you don't know what you're doing.

200
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,491
You put something wrong
in those capsules.

201
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:03,823
I know you're unhappy.

202
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,590
You got the telegram, and you're upset.

203
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,529
You put something bad
in those capsules.

204
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,931
It wasn't your fault, Mr. Gower.

205
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,401
Just look and see what you did.

206
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,065
The bottle you took the powder from,
it's poison.

207
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,835
I tell you, it's poison.

208
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,771
I know you feel bad.

209
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,874
- Oh!
- Don't hurt my sore ear again!

210
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:30,012
- Don't hurt my sore ear again.
- Oh, no, no. Oh, George, George.

211
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,920
Oh, Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone.

212
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,390
I know how you're feeling.

213
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,121
I won't ever tell a soul.
Hope to die, I won't.

214
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,094
Oh, George. George.

215
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,797
An overnight bag.
Genuine English cowhide.

216
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,266
Combination lock.

217
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,668
- Fitted up with brushes, combs...
- Nope, nope, nope, nope.

218
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,763
Now, look, Joe. Now, look.

219
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,367
I want a big one.

220
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,239
What did you stop it for?

221
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,576
I want you to take a good look
at that face.

222
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:57,671
Who is it?

223
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:58,841
George Bailey.

224
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,920
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears
slapped back by the druggist?

225
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,283
That's the kid.

226
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,392
It's a good face. I like it.

227
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,256
I like George Bailey.

228
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:12,389
Tell me,
did he ever tell anyone about the pills?

229
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:13,624
Not a soul.

230
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,731
Did he ever marry the girl?
Did he ever go exploring?

231
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,531
Well, wait and see.

232
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,399
Big, see? I don't want one for one night.

233
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,475
I want something for 1,001 nights

234
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:28,036
with plenty of room here for labels
from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand.

235
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,273
Great big thing, about...

236
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,508
- I see. A flying carpet, huh?
- Yeah.

237
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,017
I don't suppose you'd like
this old secondhand job, would you?

238
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,314
Now you're talking.

239
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,288
Gee whiz, I could use that as a raft
in case the boat sunk.

240
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,585
- How much this cost?
- No charge.

241
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,386
That's my trick ear, Joe.
It sounded like you said "no charge."

242
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:44,463
That's right.

243
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,355
Well, what's my name doing on it?

244
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:50,492
A little present from old man Gower.
Came down and picked it out himself.

245
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,970
He did? What do you know about that?
My old boss. Isn't that nice?

246
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,563
What boat are you sailing on?

247
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:56,902
I'm working across on a cattle boat.

248
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,136
- A cattle boat?
- Okay, I like cows.

249
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,381
Hello, Mr. Gower. How are you?

250
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,916
Thanks ever so much for the baggage.
It's just exactly what I wanted.

251
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,042
Forget it.

252
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,713
- It's wonderful of you to think of me.
- Hope you enjoy it.

253
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,619
I wish I had a million dollars.

254
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:12,918
Hot dog!

255
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,286
Avast there, Captain Cook!

256
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,589
- You got your sea legs yet?
- Parlez-vous Français, mister?

257
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,960
Hey, send us some of those
picture postcards, will you, George?

258
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,794
Hey, George,
don't take any plug nickels.

259
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,528
Hey, George, your suitcase is leaking.

260
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,796
Hey, Ernie!

261
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,371
- Hi, Ernie. Hi, Bert.
- Hiya, George.

262
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,236
- George.
- Hey, I'm a rich tourist today.

263
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,774
How about driving me home in style?

264
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,537
- Hop in, Your Highness. Hop in.
- Yes, sir.

265
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,512
And for the carriage trade,
I put on my hat.

266
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,343
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.

267
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:40,645
Hello, Violet.

268
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,017
Hey, you look good.
That's some dress you got on there.

269
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,589
This old thing?

270
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,557
Why, I only wear it
when I don't care how I look.

271
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:05,107
- How would you like to take...
- Yes.

272
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,206
Want to come along, Bert?
We'll show you the town.

273
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,372
No, thanks.

274
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:12,712
I think I'll go home
and see what the wife's doing.

275
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:15,884
Family man.

276
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,153
George, Harry,
you're shaking the house down.

277
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,317
Stop it.

278
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:24,055
Let them alone.
I wish I was up there with them.

279
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,098
But Harry will tear his dinner suit.
George!

280
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,099
That's why all children should be girls.

281
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,830
Well, if they were all girls
there wouldn't be any... Oh, never mind.

282
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,504
George, Harry,
come down to dinner this minute.

283
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,600
Everything's getting cold, and you know
how long we've been waiting for you.

284
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,406
- Okay, Ma.
- Okay, Ma.

285
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,738
- Ta-da!
- Ta-da!

286
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,847
- We got a present for you, Pop.
- There you are.

287
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,989
Oh, you two idiots.

288
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,958
George, sit down and have dinner.

289
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,027
- Fine.
- I've eaten.

290
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:59,393
Well, aren't you gonna finish dressing
for your graduating party? Look at you!

291
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:00,726
I don't care. It's George's tux.

292
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,391
Annie, my sweet,
have you got those pies?

293
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:05,095
If you lay a hand on me,
I'll hit you with this broom!

294
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,672
Annie, I'm in love with you.
There's a moon out tonight.

295
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:11,732
Boy, oh boy, oh boy! My last meal
in the old Bailey boarding house.

296
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,744
Oh, my lands, my blood pressure.

297
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,713
Pop, can I have the car? I gotta
take over a lot of plates and things.

298
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:17,782
What plates?

299
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:18,975
Mom, I'm chairman
of the Eats Committee.

300
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,142
We only need a couple of dozen.

301
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,415
Oh, no, you don't, Harry.
Now, not my best Haviland, no.

302
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,490
Oh, let him have the plates, Mother.

303
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:29,027
Hope you have a good trip, George.
Uncle Billy and I are gonna miss you.

304
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,288
I'm gonna miss you, too, Pop.

305
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,863
What's the matter? You look tired.

306
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,057
I had another tussle with Potter today.

307
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,225
I thought when we put him
on the board of directors,

308
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:37,632
he'd ease up on us a little bit.

309
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,330
What's eating that old
money-grubbing buzzard anyway?

310
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,340
He's a sick man, frustrated,
sick in his mind.

311
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,239
Sick in his soul, if he has one.

312
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,074
He hates everybody
that has anything that he can't have.

313
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,841
He hates us mostly, I guess.

314
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,280
Gangway. Gangway.

315
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:52,816
- So long, Pop.
- So long.

316
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,886
- You got a match?
- Very funny, very funny.

317
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:55,954
Put those things in the car,

318
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,250
and I'll get your tie and studs ready
for you. Now, hurry up.

319
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,619
- Okay, Mom.
- Now, don't drop one of those.

320
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:00,885
You coming later, George?

321
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,255
What do you mean,
and be bored to death?

322
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,192
Couldn't want a better death.
Lots of pretty girls,

323
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,854
and we're gonna use
that new floor tonight, too.

324
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,057
- I hope it works.
- No gin tonight, Son.

325
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,565
Oh, Pop, just a little?

326
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,464
No, Son. Not one drop.

327
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,099
Boys and girls and music.

328
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,070
Why do they need gin?

329
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,938
Did I act like that
when I graduated from high school?

330
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,169
Pretty much.

331
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,613
You know, George, I wish
we could send Harry to college with you.

332
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,309
Your mother and I talked it over
half the night.

333
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,248
We have that all figured out.

334
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,480
You see, Harry will take my job
at the Building and Loan,

335
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,284
work there for four years, then he'll go.

336
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,055
Pretty young for that job.

337
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,854
Well, no younger than I was.

338
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,259
Well, you were born older, George.

339
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,821
How's that?

340
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,594
I said you were born older.

341
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,293
I suppose you've decided
what you want to do

342
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,665
when you get out of college.

343
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,500
Well, you know
what I've always talked about,

344
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:51,007
build things, design new buildings,
plan modern cities.

345
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,407
All that stuff I've been talking about.

346
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,274
Still after that first million
before you're 30?

347
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,814
I'll settle for half that in cash.

348
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,510
Of course, it's just a hope.

349
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:01,849
But you wouldn't consider coming back

350
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,115
to the Building and Loan, would you?

351
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,351
Well, I... I...

352
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,087
Annie, why don't you draw up a chair?

353
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,164
Then you'd be more comfortable,

354
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,755
and you could hear everything
that's going on.

355
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,301
I would if I thought
I'd hear anything worth listening to.

356
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,927
You would, eh?

357
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,233
I know it's soon to talk about it.

358
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,865
No, now, Pop, I couldn't.

359
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,910
I couldn't face being cooped up
for the rest of my life

360
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,775
in a shabby little office.

361
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,214
I'm sorry, Pop. I didn't mean that, but I...

362
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,951
It's this business of nickels and dimes

363
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,216
and spending all your life
trying to figure out

364
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,223
how to save three cents
on a length of pipe.

365
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:43,351
I'd go crazy. I want to do something big
and something important.

366
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:46,397
You know, George,
I feel that, in a small way,

367
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,398
we're doing something important,

368
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,695
satisfying a fundamental urge.

369
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:55,069
It's deep in the race for a man to want
his own roof and walls and fireplace.

370
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,108
And we're helping him get those things

371
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,836
in our shabby little office.

372
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:02,573
I know, Pop. I know that.

373
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,710
I wish I felt that...

374
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:09,217
I've been hoarding pennies
like a miser here in order to...

375
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,419
Most of my friends
have already finished college.

376
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,918
I just feel like if I didn't get away,
I'd bust.

377
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:20,657
Yes, yes, you're right, Son.

378
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,461
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?

379
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,092
This town is no place for any man

380
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,467
unless he's willing to crawl to Potter.

381
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,063
Now, you've got talent, Son. I've seen it.

382
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,038
You get yourself an education
and get out of here.

383
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,412
Pop, you want a shock?

384
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,043
I think you're a great guy.

385
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,888
- Why, did you hear that, Annie?
- I heard it.

386
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,261
It's about time
one of you lunkheads said it.

387
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:49,886
It's about time
one of you lunkheads said it.

388
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,127
I'm gonna miss old Annie.

389
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,798
Pop, I think I'll get dressed
and go over to Harry's party.

390
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,463
Have a good time, Son.

391
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,670
Excuse me.

392
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,304
There you are.

393
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:10,472
George, hello.

394
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:11,742
You know my kid brother George.

395
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,818
- I'm gonna put him through college.
- Hello, George.

396
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,181
Hee-haw!

397
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,652
Sam Wainwright.

398
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,279
How are you? When did you get here?

399
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,449
This afternoon.
I thought I'd give the kids a treat.

400
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,924
Old college graduate now.

401
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,086
Yeah, old "Joe College" Wainwright
they call me.

402
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,994
Well, freshman, looks like
you're gonna make it after all, huh?

403
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,465
- Harry, you're the guy I want to see.
- Hello, Sam.

404
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,593
- Coach has heard all about you.
- He has?

405
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,534
Yeah, he's followed every game,
and his mouth's watering.

406
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,766
He wants me to find out
if you're gonna come along with us.

407
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,398
Well, I got to make some dough first.

408
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,034
Well, you better make it fast.
We need great ends like you.

409
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,772
Not broken-down old guys like this one.

410
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,972
Hee-haw!

411
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,439
George, welcome back.

412
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,178
Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you?

413
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,447
Putting a pool under this floor was
a great idea.

414
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,852
Saved us another building.

415
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,787
Now, Harry, Sam, have a lot of fun.

416
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,655
There's lots of stuff here to eat
and drink. Lots of pretty girls around.

417
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:57,626
A third dance... A third...

418
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,823
- Hello, Violet.
- Hello. What am I bid?

419
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,093
George.

420
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,032
Marty! Well, it's old home week.

421
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,161
- Marty!
- Sam, Harry, how are you?

422
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,136
- Do me a favor, will you, George?
- What's that?

423
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,640
- You remember my kid sister Mary.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

424
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:13,006
"Mama wants you, Marty.
Mama wants you." Remember?

425
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,442
Dance with her, will you?

426
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,640
Oh, me? Well, I feel funny enough
already with all these kids.

427
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:18,773
Come on, be a sport.

428
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:22,183
Just dance with her one time, and you'll
give her the thrill of her life. Hey, Sis!

429
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,777
Don't be long, Marty.

430
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,584
I'm not being a wet nurse to a...

431
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,659
The next thing I knew,
some guy came up and tripped me.

432
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,659
That's the reason why I came in fourth.

433
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,457
If it hadn't been for that,
that race'd have been a cinch.

434
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,499
I tried to find out who it was later,
but I couldn't find out.

435
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,934
Nobody'd ever tell you whoever it was,
because they'd be scared.

436
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:40,804
'Cause they know
what kind of a guy I am.

437
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,999
You remember George. This is Mary.

438
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,735
Well, I'll be seeing you.

439
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:45,867
Well, well, well.

440
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,674
Now to get back to my story, see?

441
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,150
Hey, this is my dance.

442
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,220
Why don't you stop annoying people?

443
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,413
Well, I'm sorry. Hey!

444
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:03,052
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

445
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,522
You look at me as if you didn't know me.

446
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:06,825
Well, I don't.

447
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,230
You've passed me on the street
almost every day.

448
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:10,392
Me?

449
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:13,767
No. That was a little girl
named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.

450
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:17,336
Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes!
The big Charleston contest!

451
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,543
The prize, a genuine loving cup.

452
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,412
Those not tapped by the judges
will remain on the floor.

453
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:26,609
Let's go!

454
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,390
I'm not very good at this.

455
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,055
Neither am I.

456
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:41,996
Okay. What can we lose?

457
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,476
Hey, you're wonderful.

458
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:25,109
What's the matter, Othello? Jealous?

459
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,972
Did you know there's a swimming pool
under this floor?

460
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:34,246
And did you know that button behind you
causes this floor to open up?

461
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,485
And did you further know
that George Bailey

462
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,888
is dancing right over that crack?

463
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,253
And I've got the key.

464
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,520
Stand back, everybody! Stand back!

465
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,383
They're cheering us. We must be good.

466
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:55,799
Get out of there!

467
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,391
What... Oh, well.

468
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,173
Buffalo gals
can't you come out tonight?

469
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,576
Can't you come out tonight?

470
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,045
Can't you come out tonight?

471
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,616
Buffalo gals, can't you come out tonight

472
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:16,513
And dance

473
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,618
By the light

474
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:24,218
Of the moon?

475
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,596
- Oh, hot dog. Just like an organ.
- Beautiful.

476
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,860
I told Harry I thought
I'd be bored to death.

477
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,198
You should have seen
the commotion in that locker room.

478
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,034
I had to knock down three people
to get this stuff we're wearing here.

479
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,005
Let me hold that old wet dress of yours.

480
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,735
Do I look as funny as you do?

481
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:40,675
I guess I'm not quite the football type.

482
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,474
You look wonderful!

483
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,245
You know, if it wasn't me talking,

484
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,909
I'd say you were
the prettiest girl in town.

485
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,953
Well, why don't you say it?

486
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:53,388
I don't know. Maybe I will say it.
How old are you anyway?

487
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,519
Eighteen.

488
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:59,085
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year
you were seventeen.

489
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,130
Too young or too old?

490
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,929
Oh, no, no. Just right. Your age fits you.

491
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,499
Yes, sir, you look a little older
without your clothes on.

492
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,939
I mean, without a dress you look older.

493
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,943
I mean younger. You look... You just...

494
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:16,971
I'm on the thing here.

495
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,016
Sir, my train, please.

496
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:21,779
A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.

497
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:25,116
Your caboose, milady.

498
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:28,116
You may kiss my hand.

499
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,028
Hey.

500
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,396
Hey, Mary.

501
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:39,497
As I was lumberin' down the street

502
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:42,004
Down the street, down the street

503
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,707
Okay, then. I'll throw a rock
at the old Granville house.

504
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,073
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.

505
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,408
No, you see, you make a wish
and then try and break some glass.

506
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:50,947
And you got to be
a pretty good shot nowadays, too.

507
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,916
Oh, no, George, don't.
It's full of romance, that old place.

508
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,884
I'd like to live in it.

509
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,110
In that place?

510
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,520
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost.
Now, watch.

511
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:02,218
Right in the second floor, there. See?

512
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,124
What did you wish, George?

513
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,633
Not just one wish, a whole hatful.

514
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,268
Mary, I know what
I'm gonna do tomorrow

515
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,498
and the next day and next year
and the year after that.

516
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:18,440
I'm shaking the dust
of this crummy little town off my feet,

517
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,272
and I'm gonna see the world!

518
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:23,438
Italy, Greece, the Parthenon,
the Coliseum.

519
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:26,176
Then I'm coming back here and go
to college to see what they know.

520
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:27,876
And then I'm gonna build things.

521
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,385
I'm gonna build airfields.

522
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,853
I'm gonna build skyscrapers
100 stories high.

523
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,323
I'm gonna build bridges a mile long.

524
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,785
What, are you gonna throw a rock?

525
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,593
Hey, that's pretty good.

526
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,269
What did you wish, Mary?

527
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,268
Buffalo gals
can't you come out tonight?

528
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,603
Can't you come out tonight?

529
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,234
Can't you come out tonight?

530
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:56,346
Buffalo gals, can't you come out tonight

531
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,440
And

532
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:03,544
Dance by the light of the moon?

533
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,589
What did you wish
when you threw that rock?

534
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,089
- Oh, no.
- Come on, tell me.

535
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,750
If I told you, it might not come true.

536
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,589
What is it you want, Mary?

537
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,157
What do you want? You want the moon?

538
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:17,130
Just say the word, and I'll throw a lasso
around it and pull it down.

539
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:20,932
Hey, that's a pretty good idea.
I'll give you the moon, Mary.

540
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,571
I'll take it.

541
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,065
Then what?

542
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:28,034
Well, then you could swallow it,
and it would all dissolve, see?

543
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:31,914
And the moonbeams would shoot out
of your fingers and your toes

544
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,008
and the ends of your hair.

545
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:38,083
- Am I talking too much?
- Yes!

546
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,388
Why don't you kiss her
instead of talking her to death?

547
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,517
How's that?

548
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:46,063
Why don't you kiss her
instead of talking her to death?

549
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:49,290
You want me to kiss her, huh?

550
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:52,768
Youth is wasted on the wrong people.

551
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:57,205
Hey. Hey, hold on, hey, mister.
Come on back out here!

552
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:01,506
I'll show you some kissing that'll put
hair back on your head. What are you...

553
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:09,945
Mary?

554
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,100
Okay, I give up. Where are you?

555
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,303
Over here in the hydrangea bushes.

556
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,869
Here you are. Catch.

557
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,373
Wait a minute. What am I doing?

558
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:39,105
This is a very interesting situation.

559
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,014
Please give me my robe.

560
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:45,617
A man doesn't get in a situation
like this every day.

561
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,988
I'd like to have my robe.

562
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,321
Not in Bedford Falls, anyway.

563
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,622
- Ouch! Oh!
- Gesundheit.

564
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,394
- George Bailey!
- This requires a little thought here.

565
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,126
Give me my robe.

566
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,634
I've read about things like this,
but I've never...

567
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,865
Shame on you!
I'm gonna tell your mother on you.

568
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:04,567
My mother's way up on the corner there.

569
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,610
I'll call the police.

570
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:09,475
They're way downtown.
They'd be on my side, too.

571
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,412
Then I'm going to scream!

572
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,913
Maybe I could sell tickets.

573
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,154
Let's see. No, the point is

574
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,918
in order to get this robe... I've got it.

575
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,920
I'll make a deal with you, Mary.

576
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:25,325
George! George!

577
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,097
George, come on home! Quick!

578
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,567
- Your father's had a stroke.
- What?

579
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:35,972
- Mary, Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
- Come on, George, let's hurry.

580
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:37,405
- Did you get a doctor?
- Yes.

581
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,306
Campbell's there now.

582
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,146
I think that's all
we'll need you for, George.

583
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:54,089
- I know you're anxious to make a train.
- I have a taxi waiting downstairs.

584
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,990
I want the board to know
that George gave up his trip to Europe

585
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,825
to help straighten things out here
these past few months.

586
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,796
Good luck to you at school, George.

587
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,834
- Good luck, George.
- Goodbye, George.

588
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,529
And now we come to the real purpose
of this meeting,

589
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,300
to appoint a successor
to our dear friend Peter Bailey.

590
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,534
Mr. Chairman,
I'd like to get to my real purpose.

591
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,838
- Wait just a minute now.
- Wait for what?

592
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:17,278
I claim this institution
is not necessary to this town.

593
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:21,216
Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I make
a motion to dissolve this institution

594
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,584
and turn its assets and liabilities
over to the receiver.

595
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:26,623
Potter, you dirty, contemptible...
I'll wring his neck.

596
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:27,713
George, did you hear
what that buzzard...

597
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,020
Mr. Chairman.

598
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:30,719
It's too soon after Peter Bailey's death

599
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,127
to talk about chloroforming
the Building and Loan.

600
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,631
Peter Bailey died three months ago.

601
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:37,530
I second Mr. Potter's motion.

602
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,034
Very well. In that case,

603
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:42,971
I'll ask the two executive officers
to withdraw. But before you go,

604
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:46,202
I'm sure the whole board wishes
to express its deep sorrow

605
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,472
- at the passing of Peter Bailey.
- Thank you very much.

606
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,514
It was his faith and devotion

607
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,139
that are responsible
for this organization.

608
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,150
I'll go further than that.

609
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:58,655
I'll say that to the public
Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan.

610
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:00,951
That's fine, Potter, coming from you,

611
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,027
considering that you probably
drove him to his grave.

612
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,925
Peter Bailey was not a businessman.

613
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,463
That's what killed him.

614
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:10,261
Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him.
God rest his soul.

615
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,804
He was a man of high ideals, so-called.

616
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:18,003
But ideals without common sense
can ruin this town.

617
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,741
Now, you take this loan here
to Ernie Bishop,

618
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:25,145
you know,
that fellow that sits around all day

619
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,014
on his brains in his taxi, you know.

620
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:31,919
I happen to know
the bank turned down this loan.

621
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,684
But he comes here,

622
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:38,524
and we're building him
a house worth $5,000.

623
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,730
- Why?
- Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter.

624
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,666
You have all the papers there.
His salary, insurance.

625
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,464
I can personally vouch for his character.

626
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,436
- A friend of yours?
- Yes, sir.

627
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:52,439
You see, if you shoot pool
with some employee here,

628
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,738
you can come and borrow money.

629
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:56,946
What does that get us?

630
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,915
A discontented, lazy rabble

631
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:01,883
instead of a thrifty working class.

632
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:05,786
And all because
a few starry-eyed dreamers

633
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:09,053
like Peter Bailey stir them up
and fill their heads

634
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,390
with a lot of impossible ideas.

635
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,293
Now, I say...

636
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:16,231
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Now, hold on, Mr. Potter.

637
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:19,565
You're right when you say my father
was no businessman. I know that.

638
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:22,299
Why he ever started this cheap
penny-ante Building and Loan

639
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,465
I'll never know.

640
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:26,407
But neither you nor anybody else
can say anything against his character,

641
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:28,206
because his whole life was...

642
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,907
Why, in the 25 years since he
and Uncle Billy started this thing,

643
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,313
he never once thought of himself.
Isn't that right, Uncle Billy?

644
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:36,251
He didn't save enough money
to send Harry to school, let alone me.

645
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:39,084
But he did help a few people
get out of your slums, Mr. Potter.

646
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:43,251
And what's wrong with that?
Why, here, you're all businessmen here.

647
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:46,592
Don't it make them better citizens, and
doesn't it make them better customers?

648
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,893
You said that they...
What'd you say just a minute ago?

649
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,797
They had to wait and save their money

650
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,335
before they even thought
of a decent home.

651
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:54,098
Wait? Wait for what?

652
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,866
Until their children grow up
and leave them?

653
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,135
Until they're so old
and broken-down that they...

654
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,836
Do you know how long it takes
a working man to save $5,000?

655
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:04,312
Just remember this, Mr. Potter,
that this rabble you're talking about,

656
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:08,317
they do most of the working and paying
and living and dying in this community.

657
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:10,853
Well, is it too much to have them work
and pay and live and die

658
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:12,718
in a couple of decent rooms and a bath?

659
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,883
Anyway, my father didn't think so.

660
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:17,857
People were human beings to him,
but to you,

661
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:20,863
a warped, frustrated old man,
they're cattle.

662
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,830
Well, in my book, he died
a much richer man than you'll ever be.

663
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,459
I'm not interested in your book.

664
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,334
I'm talking about the Building and Loan.

665
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,100
I know very well
what you're talking about.

666
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,506
You're talking about something
you can't get your fingers on,

667
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,408
and it's galling you.
That's what you're talking about, I know.

668
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,777
Well, I've said too much. I...

669
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:41,184
You're the Board here.
You do what you want with this thing.

670
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:42,843
There's just one thing more, though.

671
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,548
This town needs
this measly one-horse institution

672
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:49,183
if only to have someplace where people
can come without crawling to Potter.

673
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:50,294
Come on, Uncle Billy.

674
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:59,800
Sentimental hogwash. I want my motion.

675
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,497
Boy, oh boy, that was telling him,
George, old boy.

676
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,406
You shut his big mouth.
You should have heard him.

677
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,172
What happened?
We heard a lot of yelling.

678
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:10,907
Well, we're being voted
out of business after 25 years.

679
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:14,473
- Easy come, easy go.
- Here it is. "Help wanted. Female."

680
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,553
You still want me
to hang around, George?

681
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:19,145
- Yeah, I'll be right down.
- Yeah, hey, you'll miss your train.

682
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:21,054
You're a week late for school already.
Go on.

683
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,923
- What's going on in there?
- Never mind. Don't worry about that.

684
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:27,054
They're putting us out of business.
So what? I can get another job.

685
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:28,860
- I'm only 55.
- 56.

686
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:31,298
Go on, go on.
Hey, look, you gave up your boat trip,

687
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,960
now you don't want to miss college,
too, do you?

688
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,505
George! George!
They voted Potter down.

689
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,369
They want to keep it going.

690
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,933
You did it, George. You did it.

691
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:42,205
They got one condition,
only one condition.

692
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:43,871
- What's that?
- And that's the best part of it.

693
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,972
They've appointed George here
as Executive Secretary

694
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,346
to take his father's place.

695
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:50,285
- Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy...
- You can keep him on. That's all right.

696
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:52,288
As Secretary,
you can hire anyone you like.

697
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,984
Dr. Campbell, now let's get
this thing straight. I'm leaving.

698
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,685
I'm leaving right now.
I'm going to school.

699
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:59,262
This is my last chance.
Uncle Billy here, he's your man.

700
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:02,161
But, George,
they'll vote with Potter otherwise.

701
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:07,004
- I know, I know, he didn't go.
- That's right.

702
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:10,432
Not only that, but he gave
his school money to his brother, Harry,

703
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,008
and sent him to college.

704
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,975
Harry became a football star.

705
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:15,875
Made second team all-American.

706
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,044
Yeah, but what happened to George?

707
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:21,209
George got four years older,
waiting for Harry to come back

708
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,344
and take over the Building and Loans.

709
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,055
There are plenty of jobs around
for somebody that likes to travel.

710
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:27,283
Look at this. Here.

711
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:31,122
Venezuela oil fields. "Wanted,
man with construction experience."

712
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,527
Here's the Yukon, right here.

713
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,963
"Wanted,
man with engineering experience."

714
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,932
There she blows.

715
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,903
You know what the three most exciting
sounds in the world are?

716
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:44,236
Breakfast is served.
Lunch is served. Dinner...

717
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:48,039
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains,
plane motors and train whistles.

718
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,273
- Peanut?
- There's the professor now.

719
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,679
Old Professor Phi Beta Kappa
all-American Baily.

720
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,808
Why, old George
"Geographic Explorer" Bailey.

721
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,479
What? No husky dogs? No sled?
Uncle Billy, you haven't changed a bit.

722
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:59,078
Nobody ever changes here,
you know that.

723
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,851
Oh, am I glad to see you.

724
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,119
- Say, where's Mother?
- She's home, cooking the fatted calf.

725
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,058
- Come on, let's go.
- Oh, wait! Wait, wait a minute.

726
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,098
George, Uncle Billy,
I want you to meet Ruth.

727
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,530
- Hello.
- How do you do?

728
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:12,364
- Ruth Dakin.
- Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind.

729
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,836
- Huh?
- Well, I wired you I had a surprise.

730
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,531
Here she is. Meet the wife.

731
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:19,439
Well, what do you know? A wife.

732
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:23,304
- Well, how do you do? Congratulations.
- How do you do?

733
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,115
What am I doing? Congratulations!

734
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,946
- Doggone it, Harry, you...
- They're married!

735
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,179
Why don't you tell somebody?

736
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,813
Come on, Mrs. Bailey,
I can't wait to see everybody's reaction.

737
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,323
- You're really married?
- Why, yes.

738
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:36,120
What's a pretty girl like you doing

739
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,161
marrying this two-headed brother
of mine?

740
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:40,958
Well, I'll tell you. It's purely mercenary.
My father offered him a job.

741
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:45,161
Oh, he got you and the job?
Well, Harry's cup runneth over.

742
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:49,839
George, about that job. Ruth spoke
out of turn. I never said I'd take it.

743
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,769
You've been holding the bag here
for four years, and,

744
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,641
well, I won't let you down, George.
I would like to...

745
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:58,874
Oh, wait a minute. I forgot the bags.
I'll be right back.

746
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,644
It was a surprise to me.

747
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,742
This is the new Mrs. Bailey,
my nephew's wife.

748
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:06,016
- How are you?
- Old, old friend of the Baileys.

749
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:08,648
Oh, really? What are their names?
Let's see...

750
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,285
Oh, of course,
I've heard him speak of you.

751
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,762
And I want to tell you,
we're gonna give the biggest party

752
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,298
this town ever saw.

753
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:20,797
Here, have some popcorn.

754
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,437
George, George, George.
That's all Harry ever talks about.

755
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:27,769
Ruth, this...

756
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,071
What about this job?

757
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,546
Well, my father owns a glass factory
in Buffalo.

758
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:34,379
He wants to get Harry started
in the research business.

759
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,646
- Well, is it a good job?
- Oh, yes, very.

760
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,382
Not much money,
but good future, you know.

761
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,822
- Yeah.
- Harry's a genius at research.

762
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,293
- My father just fell in love with him.
- And you did, too.

763
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:00,944
Hey, Joe.

764
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:04,878
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
I feel so good.

765
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:09,385
I could spit in Potter's eye.
I think I will. I think I will.

766
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:11,950
What did you say? Huh?

767
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,788
Maybe I'd better go home.

768
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:17,156
Where's my hat? Where's my...

769
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:21,123
- Oh, thank you, George. Which is mine?
- The middle one.

770
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:24,258
Oh, thank you, George.
Oh boy, oh boy. Now, look,

771
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:27,701
if you'll point me in the right direction...
Would you do that, George?

772
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:28,931
Right down here.

773
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,736
Old Building and Loan pal, huh?

774
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,106
Now you just turn this way
and then right straight down there.

775
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:35,269
Oh, that way, huh?

776
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,640
My wild Irish rose

777
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:46,315
I'm all right. I'm all right.

778
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:29,857
Hello, Ma.

779
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,661
That's for nothing.

780
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,267
- How do you like her?
- She's swell, isn't she?

781
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,506
Looks like
she can keep Harry on his toes.

782
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,909
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.

783
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:47,846
Did you know that Mary Hatch
is back from school?

784
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,577
Came back three days ago.

785
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,786
Nice girl, Mary.

786
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:58,423
Kind that'll help you
find the answers, George.

787
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:00,930
Stop that grunting.

788
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,468
Can you give me one good reason
why you shouldn't call on Mary?

789
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,060
Sure. Sam Wainwright.

790
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,000
- Hee-haw?
- Yes, Sam's crazy about Mary.

791
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:12,405
- Well, she's not crazy about him.
- Well, how do you know?

792
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,239
- What, did she discuss it with you?
- No.

793
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:17,041
- Well, then how do you know?
- Well, I've got eyes, haven't I?

794
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:20,276
Why, she lights up like a firefly
whenever you're around.

795
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,084
Besides,
Sam Wainwright's away in New York,

796
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:28,147
- and you're here in Bedford Falls.
- And all's fair in love and war.

797
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,457
I don't know about war.

798
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:37,595
Mother of mine, I can see right through
you right to your back-collar button.

799
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:39,669
Trying to get rid of me, huh?

800
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,741
Well, here's your hat.
What's your hurry?

801
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,711
All right, Mother,
old Building and Loan pal,

802
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:52,044
I think I'll go out and find a girl
and do a little passionate necking.

803
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:53,343
Oh, George.

804
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,443
Now, if you'll just point me
in the right direction...

805
00:40:57,822 --> 00:40:59,119
This direction.

806
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,991
Good night, Mrs. Bailey.

807
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:22,072
- Excuse me.
- Now, wait a minute.

808
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,306
I think I got a date.

809
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:27,111
But stick around, fellows,
just in case, huh?

810
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,181
We'll wait for you, baby.

811
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:34,283
- Hello, Georgie Porgie!
- Hello Vi.

812
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,618
- What gives?
- Nothing.

813
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:39,956
Where are you going?

814
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:42,897
Oh, I'll probably end up
down at the library.

815
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,334
Georgie, don't you ever get tired
of just reading about things?

816
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,473
Yes.

817
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,808
- What are you doing tonight?
- Not a thing.

818
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,207
Are you game, Vi?
Let's make a night of it.

819
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,473
I'd love it, Georgie. What'll we do?

820
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,478
Let's go out in the fields
and take off our shoes

821
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:02,017
- and walk through the grass.
- Huh?

822
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:04,986
Then we can go up to the falls.
It's beautiful up there in the moonlight,

823
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:09,253
and there's a green pool up there,
and we can swim in it.

824
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:13,092
Then we can climb Mount Bedford
and smell the pines

825
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,824
and watch the sunrise
against the peaks,

826
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,365
and we'll stay up there the whole night,

827
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:18,697
and everybody'll be talking.
There'll be a terrific scandal.

828
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:22,533
Georgie, have you gone crazy?
Why, walk in the grass in my bare feet?

829
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,635
Why it's 10 miles up to Mount Bedford.

830
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:30,103
- Lf you think...
- Okay, just forget about the whole thing.

831
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:51,166
- What are you doing, picketing?
- Hello, Mary.

832
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,328
I just happened to be passing by here.

833
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:56,234
Yes, so I noticed.

834
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:59,169
- Have you made up your mind?
- How's that?

835
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:01,904
- Have you made up your mind?
- About what?

836
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,343
About coming in.

837
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,005
Your mother just phoned
and said you were on your way over

838
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:08,880
- to pay me a visit.
- My mother just called you?

839
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:10,351
Well, how did she know?

840
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:12,422
- Didn't you tell her?
- I didn't tell anybody.

841
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:15,321
I just went for a walk
and happened to be passing by here.

842
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,916
What do you...

843
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:20,593
Went for a walk. That's all.

844
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:24,866
- I'll be downstairs, Mother.
- All right, dear.

845
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,854
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?

846
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:51,421
Well, I'll come in for a minute.

847
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:54,862
But I...

848
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:10,037
I didn't tell anybody
I was coming over here, you know.

849
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:14,311
- When did you get back?
- Tuesday.

850
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,384
Where did you get that dress?

851
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,013
- Do you like it?
- It's all right.

852
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,295
I thought you would go back
to New York,

853
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:28,729
like Sam and Angie
and the rest of them.

854
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,727
I worked there a couple of vacations,
but I don't know.

855
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,202
I guess I was homesick.

856
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:38,274
Homesick? For Bedford Falls?

857
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:41,534
Yes, and my family and...

858
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:43,940
Everything.

859
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:46,976
Would you like to sit down?

860
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:48,881
All right, for a minute.

861
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:51,648
I still can't understand it, though.

862
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,882
You know, I didn't tell anybody
I was coming here.

863
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:55,322
Would you rather leave?

864
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:57,257
No. I don't want to be rude.

865
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,851
Well, then, sit down.

866
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:00,256
What's that?

867
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,823
Some joke, huh?

868
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:11,133
Well...

869
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:15,376
I see it still smells like pine needles
around here.

870
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:17,238
Thank you.

871
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,250
And dance by the

872
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,122
What's the matter?

873
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:31,017
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah.

874
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:35,059
Well...

875
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:37,497
Nice about your brother Harry
and Ruth, isn't it?

876
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,660
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's all right.

877
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:41,095
Don't you like her?

878
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:43,639
Well, of course I like her.
She's a peach.

879
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:48,744
Oh, just marriage in general
you're not enthusiastic about, huh?

880
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:53,340
No. Marriage is all right
for Harry and Marty and Sam and you.

881
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,145
Mary! Mary!

882
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,617
Who's down there with you?

883
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,551
It's George Bailey, Mother.

884
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:01,349
George Bailey? What's he want?

885
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:02,955
I don't know.

886
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,758
What do you want?

887
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:08,293
Me? Not a thing.

888
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,389
I just came in to get warm.

889
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,530
He's making violent love to me, Mother.

890
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:19,334
You tell him to go right back home,
and don't you leave the house, either!

891
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,537
Sam Wainwright promised to call you
from New York tonight.

892
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:25,638
What's your mother mean?
You know, I didn't come here to...

893
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:28,240
- What did you come here for, then?
- I don't know. You tell me.

894
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:30,946
You're supposed to be the one
that has all the answers. You tell me.

895
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:32,885
- Why don't you go home?
- That's where I'm going.

896
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,617
I don't know why I came here
in the first place.

897
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:36,158
- Good night.
- Good night!

898
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:39,252
Mary! Mary! The telephone. It's Sam.

899
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:40,557
I'll get it.

900
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:43,426
Whatever were you doing
that you couldn't hear?

901
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:54,773
Mary, he's waiting.

902
00:46:58,248 --> 00:46:59,306
Hello?

903
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,615
Forgot my hat.

904
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,852
Hee-haw! Hello, Sam, how are you?

905
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:10,984
I'm great.
Gee, it's good to hear your voice again.

906
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:13,858
Well, that's awfully sweet of you, Sam.

907
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:18,097
There's an old friend of yours here.
George Bailey.

908
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:20,102
You mean old mossback George?

909
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,804
Yes, old mossback George.

910
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:24,840
Hee-haw! Put him on.

911
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:27,206
Wait just a minute. I'll call him. George!

912
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:29,472
He doesn't want to speak to George,
you idiot.

913
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,411
He does so. He asked for him.

914
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:34,944
George, Sam wants to speak to you.

915
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:40,378
Hi, Sam.

916
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:44,290
Well, George Bailyoffski!
Hey, a fine pal you are.

917
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:46,225
What're you trying to do, steal my girl?

918
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,297
What do you mean?

919
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:49,194
Nobody's trying to steal anybody's girl.

920
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,199
Here... Here's Mary.

921
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:53,633
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I want to talk to both of you.

922
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:55,204
Tell Mary to get on the extension.

923
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:58,570
- Mother's on the extension. We...
- I am not!

924
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:00,706
We can both hear. Come here.

925
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:03,512
We're listening, Sam.

926
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:07,141
Well, look, I have a big deal coming up
that's gonna make us all rich.

927
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:09,811
George, do you remember
that night in Martini's bar

928
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,583
when you told me you'd read someplace
about making plastics out of soybeans?

929
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,817
- Chili beans.
- Shut up, will you?

930
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:18,588
You remember, out of chili...
Out of soybeans.

931
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,897
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Soybeans, yeah.

932
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,298
Well, listen, Dad snapped up the idea,

933
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,893
and he's gonna build
a factory outside of Rochester.

934
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:29,495
How do you like that?

935
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:34,438
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?

936
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:37,240
Well, why not?
Can you think of anything better?

937
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,979
Well, I don't know.
Just why not right here?

938
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:44,781
You remember that old tool
and machinery works?

939
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:46,879
You tell your father
he can get that for a song.

940
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,252
And all the labor he wants, too.

941
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:50,792
Half the town was thrown out of work
when they closed down.

942
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:53,158
That so? Well, I'll tell him.

943
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,594
Hey, that sounds great.

944
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:56,529
Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through.

945
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:59,659
Now here's the point, Mary.
Mary, you're in on this, too.

946
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,170
Now listen. Have you got any money?

947
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:06,876
Money? Yeah... Well, a little.

948
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:07,944
Well, now, listen.

949
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:11,208
I want you to put every cent you've got
into our stock, do you hear?

950
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:14,011
And, George, I may have a job for you,

951
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:18,053
that is unless you're still married
to that broken-down Building and Loan.

952
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:20,350
Well, this is the biggest thing
since radio,

953
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,550
and I'm letting you in
on the ground floor.

954
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:24,684
Oh, Mary. Mary?

955
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:28,589
I'm here.

956
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,962
Would you tell that guy

957
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:33,093
I'm giving him the chance
of a lifetime, do you hear?

958
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:35,034
The chance of a lifetime!

959
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,935
He says it's the chance of a lifetime.

960
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,971
Now you listen to me.

961
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:49,218
I don't want any plastics,
and I don't want any ground floors.

962
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,253
And I don't want to get married,
ever, to anyone.

963
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:52,754
You understand that?

964
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:54,790
I want to do what I want to do.

965
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,917
And you're... And you're...

966
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:01,486
- Oh, Mary, Mary.
- George, George, George.

967
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:05,495
Oh, Mary.

968
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:10,631
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

969
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:13,469
Mary...

970
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:15,703
Here they come! Here they come!

971
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,066
Goodbye, George!

972
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:47,743
Goodbye!

973
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,709
First Harry, now George.

974
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:59,982
Annie, we're just two old maids now.

975
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,183
You speak for yourself, Miss B.

976
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:08,228
If either of you two
see a stranger around here, it's me.

977
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,901
Hey, look.
There's somebody driving this cab.

978
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:14,800
Bert the cop sent this over.

979
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,271
He said to float away
to Happyland on the bubbles.

980
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:19,535
Oh, look at this. Old Bert. Champagne!

981
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:22,806
By the way, where are you two going
on this here now honeymoon?

982
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,006
Where are we going? Look at this.

983
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:27,481
There's the kitty, Ernie.
Here, come on, count it, Mary.

984
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,643
I feel like a bootlegger's wife. Look.

985
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,119
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna shoot the works.

986
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,452
A whole week in New York.
A whole week in Bermuda.

987
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:36,992
The highest hotels,
the oldest champagne,

988
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:41,588
the richest caviar, the hottest music
and the prettiest wife.

989
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:43,928
That does it! Then what?

990
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:47,003
- Then what, honey?
- After that, who cares?

991
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,438
That does it, come here. Come here.

992
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:54,166
Don't look now,
but there's something funny

993
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,472
going on over there
at the bank, George.

994
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:00,573
I've never really seen one, but that's got
all the earmarks of being a run.

995
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,117
Hey, Ernie, if you got any money
in the bank, you better hurry.

996
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:12,957
George, let's not stop. Let's go!

997
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:14,530
Just a minute, dear.

998
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:21,094
- Please, let's not stop, George.
- I'll be back in a minute, Mary.

999
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:40,178
Well, hello, everybody.
Mrs. Thompson, how are you?

1000
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,088
Charlie? What's the matter here,
can't you get in?

1001
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:02,673
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?

1002
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:04,105
George.

1003
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:08,807
Come on in, everybody.
That's right. Just come on in.

1004
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:10,313
Look out, you.

1005
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:14,148
Now, look, why don't you all sit down?

1006
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:16,418
There are a lot of seats over there.

1007
00:53:17,427 --> 00:53:19,292
Just make yourselves at home.

1008
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:23,297
George, can I see you a minute?

1009
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,130
- Why didn't you call me?
- I just did, but they said you left.

1010
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:27,794
This is a pickle, George.
This is a pickle.

1011
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:29,428
All right, now, what happened?
How did it start?

1012
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:30,631
How does a thing like this ever start?

1013
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,401
- All I know is the bank called our loan.
- When?

1014
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:34,670
About an hour ago.
I handed over all our cash.

1015
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:36,109
- All of it?
- Every cent of it,

1016
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,579
- and still it was less than we owe them.
- Holy mackerel!

1017
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:40,775
And then I got scared, George,
and closed the doors.

1018
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,511
I... I...

1019
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:46,317
The whole town's gone crazy.

1020
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:47,720
Yeah, hello?

1021
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:49,949
George, it's Potter.

1022
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:54,588
Hello?

1023
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:58,862
George, there is a rumor around town
that you've closed your doors.

1024
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:00,402
Is that true?

1025
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:03,201
Oh, well, I'm very glad to hear that.

1026
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:06,639
George, are you all right?
Do you need any police?

1027
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,074
Police? What for?

1028
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:12,145
Well, mobs get pretty ugly
sometimes, you know.

1029
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:16,909
George, I'm going all out
to help in this crisis.

1030
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:22,191
I've just guaranteed the bank
sufficient funds to meet their needs.

1031
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,892
They'll close up for a week
and then reopen.

1032
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:28,559
He just took over the bank.

1033
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:30,457
I may lose a fortune,

1034
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:34,401
but I'm willing
to guarantee your people, too.

1035
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:36,972
Just tell them
to bring their shares over here,

1036
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:39,633
and I will pay 50 cents on the dollar.

1037
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:41,836
You never miss a trick, do you, Potter?

1038
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,105
Well, you're gonna miss this one.

1039
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:46,876
If you close your doors before 6:00 p.m.,
you will never reopen.

1040
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:57,158
George, was it a nice wedding?

1041
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,228
Gosh, I wanted to be there.

1042
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:00,687
Yeah.

1043
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,497
You can take this one off now.

1044
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:18,712
Now, just remember that this thing
isn't as black as it appeared.

1045
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,322
I have some news for you, folks.

1046
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:31,826
I was just talking to old man Potter,

1047
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:33,520
and he's guaranteed cash payments
at the bank.

1048
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,154
The bank's gonna reopen next week.

1049
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:37,165
But, George, I got my money here.

1050
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:38,825
Did he guarantee this place?

1051
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:41,927
Well, no, Charlie. I didn't even ask him.
We don't need Potter over here.

1052
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:43,699
Then, I'll take mine now.

1053
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,732
No, but you're...

1054
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:48,635
You're thinking of this place all wrong,

1055
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:52,340
as if I had the money back in a safe.
The money's not here.

1056
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,940
Well, your money's in Joe's house.
That's right next to yours.

1057
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:57,281
And in the Kennedy house
and Mrs. Macklin's house

1058
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:58,877
and 100 others.

1059
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:00,546
Why, you're lending them
the money to build,

1060
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:02,682
and then, they're gonna pay it back
to you as best they can.

1061
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,419
Now, what are you gonna do,
foreclose on them?

1062
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:10,523
I got $242 in here,
and $242 isn't going to break anybody.

1063
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:13,994
Okay, Tom. All right.

1064
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:16,830
Here you are. You sign this.
You'll get your money in 60 days.

1065
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,066
Sixty days?

1066
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:20,199
Now, that's what you agreed to
when you bought your shares.

1067
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,403
- Tom! Tom, did you get your money?
- No.

1068
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:23,501
Well, I did.

1069
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:26,241
Old man Potter'll pay 50 cents
on the dollar for every share you've got.

1070
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:28,909
- Fifty cents on the dollar!
- Yes, cash!

1071
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:30,576
Well, what do you say?

1072
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:33,281
Now, Tom, you have to stick
to your original agreement.

1073
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,721
Now, give us 60 days on this.

1074
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,849
- Okay, Randall.
- Are you going to go to Potter's?

1075
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,053
Better to get half than nothing.

1076
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:41,187
Tom! Tom!

1077
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:43,428
Randall! Now, Randall, wait! Wait.

1078
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:47,633
Now, listen. Now, listen to me.
I beg of you not to do this thing.

1079
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,796
If Potter gets a hold
of this Building and Loan,

1080
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,840
there'll never be
another decent house built in this town.

1081
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:53,431
He's already got charge of the bank.

1082
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,568
He's got the bus line.
He got the department stores.

1083
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:58,374
And now he's after us. Why?
Well, it's very simple.

1084
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:00,711
Because we're cutting in
on his business, that's why.

1085
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:02,910
And because he wants
to keep you living in his slums

1086
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:04,884
and paying the kind of rent he decides.

1087
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:06,922
Joe, you had one
of those Potter houses, didn't you?

1088
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:07,990
Well, have you forgotten?

1089
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,457
Have you forgotten what he charged you
for that broken-down shack?

1090
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,654
Here, Ed, you know. You remember last
year when things weren't going so well

1091
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:14,923
and you couldn't make your payments.

1092
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:16,464
Well, you didn't lose your house,
did you?

1093
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:18,295
You think Potter would've
let you keep it?

1094
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:21,063
Can't you understand
what's happening here?

1095
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:22,729
Don't you see what's happening?

1096
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:25,535
Potter isn't selling.
Potter's buying, and why?

1097
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:27,803
Because we're panicky and he's not.
That's why.

1098
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:29,105
He's picking up some bargain.

1099
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:31,544
Now we can get through
this thing all right.

1100
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:33,445
We've got to stick together, though.

1101
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,017
We've got to have faith in each other.

1102
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:38,315
But my husband hasn't worked
in over a year, and I need money.

1103
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:40,116
How am going to live
until the bank opens?

1104
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:42,521
- I got doctor bills to pay.
- I need cash.

1105
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,525
I can't feed my kids on faith.

1106
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,288
How much do you need?

1107
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:49,832
Hey! I got $2,000.

1108
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,968
Here's $2,000.
This'll tide us over till the bank reopens.

1109
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:55,833
- All right, Tom, how much do you need?
- $242.

1110
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:58,430
Tom, just enough to tide you over
until the bank reopens.

1111
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:00,702
I'll take $242.

1112
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,276
- There you are.
- That'll close my account.

1113
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:07,679
Your account's still here. That's a loan.

1114
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:11,117
- Okay. All right, Ed?
- I got $300 here, George.

1115
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:14,782
Now, Ed, what'll it take
till the bank opens? What do you need?

1116
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:17,223
Well, I suppose $20.

1117
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:20,125
$20. Now you're talking.
Thanks, Ed. That's fine.

1118
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,822
All right, now, Mrs. Thompson,
how much do you want?

1119
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:23,193
But it's your own money, George.

1120
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:24,960
Never mind about that.
How much do you want?

1121
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:27,127
- I can get along with $20, all right.
- $20, fine.

1122
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:29,364
- And I'll sign the paper.
- You don't have to sign anything.

1123
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:31,565
I know you. You pay it when you can.
That's okay.

1124
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:35,041
- All right, Mrs. Davis?
- Could I have $17.50?

1125
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:40,280
Bless your heart. Of course
you can have it. You got 50 cents?

1126
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:41,748
- Seven...
- We're gonna make it, George.

1127
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,341
...six...
- They'll never close us up today!

1128
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:47,913
...five, four, three, two,

1129
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:50,150
one, bingo!

1130
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,887
We made it! Close the door, Eustace!
We made it.

1131
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:54,896
Look, look, we're still in business.
We've still got 2 bucks left.

1132
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:56,795
Look, let's have some of that.
Let's celebrate!

1133
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,299
Get some glasses, Tilly.

1134
00:58:58,401 --> 00:59:01,632
- Well, a couple of financial wizards.
- Call us Rockefellers.

1135
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:04,229
Get a tray for these two
great big important simoleons here.

1136
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:05,864
We'll save them for seed. A toast.

1137
00:59:05,975 --> 00:59:09,411
A toast. A toast to Mama Dollar
and to Papa Dollar,

1138
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:11,605
and if you want to keep this old
Building and Loan in business,

1139
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,181
you better have a family real quick.

1140
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:16,081
- I wish they were rabbits.
- I wish they were, too.

1141
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:19,211
Okay, let's put them in the safe
and see what happens.

1142
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:27,822
Close the door.

1143
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:29,831
Folks, folks, wedding cigars.

1144
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:33,334
Wedding. Holy mackerel, I'm married.

1145
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:36,064
Where's Mary? Mary! Poor...

1146
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:38,299
Look, I got a train to catch.
Well, the train's gone.

1147
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,774
I wonder if Ernie's still here
with his taxicab.

1148
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:43,277
George, there's a call for you.

1149
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:44,676
Look, will you get my wife
on the phone?

1150
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:46,146
She's probably over at her mother's.

1151
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:47,717
Mrs. Bailey is on the phone.

1152
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:49,875
I don't want Mrs. Bailey. I want my wife.

1153
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:53,513
Mrs. Bailey! Oh, that's my wife.
Here, I'll take it in here.

1154
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,949
Mary. Hello. Listen, dear, I'm sorry.

1155
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:01,090
Huh? Come home? What home?

1156
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:05,595
320 Sycamore? Well, what...
Whose home is that?

1157
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:08,630
The Waldorf Hotel, huh?

1158
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:22,274
Hey, this is the company's posters,
and the company won't like this.

1159
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:24,353
How would you like
to get a ticket next week?

1160
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,751
You got any romance in you?

1161
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:28,415
- Sure, I had it, but I got rid of it.
- Liver pills.

1162
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:31,015
Who wants to see liver pills
on their honeymoon?

1163
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:33,527
What we want is romantic places,
beautiful places,

1164
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,427
places George wants to go.

1165
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,528
Hey, Bert. Here he comes.

1166
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:39,863
Come on, we got to get this up.
He's coming.

1167
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,834
- Who?
- The groom, idiot.

1168
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:43,803
This is their honeymoon.
Come on. Get that ladder.

1169
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:45,396
What are they, ducks?

1170
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:50,474
- Get that ladder up here.
- All right, all right.

1171
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:53,378
- Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying.

1172
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:05,086
Hiya... Good evening, sir.

1173
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:33,004
Welcome home, Mr. Bailey.

1174
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:39,550
Well, I'll be...

1175
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,423
Mary. Mary, where did you...

1176
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:10,217
Oh, Mary.

1177
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:16,119
Remember the night we broke
some windows in this old house?

1178
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:19,584
This is what I wished for.

1179
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:25,526
You're wonderful.

1180
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,439
You're wonderful.

1181
01:03:49,522 --> 01:03:53,515
- Martini, you rented a new house?
- Rent?

1182
01:03:54,828 --> 01:03:57,262
- You hear what he say, Mr. Bailey?
- What's that?

1183
01:03:57,363 --> 01:03:59,024
I own the house.

1184
01:03:59,299 --> 01:04:02,632
Me, Giuseppe Martini,
I own my own house.

1185
01:04:02,735 --> 01:04:06,034
No more we live like a pigs
in this Potter's Field.

1186
01:04:06,172 --> 01:04:09,232
- Mary, Mary!
- Mary, come on, bring the baby.

1187
01:04:09,943 --> 01:04:11,706
I feel like a queen.

1188
01:04:11,811 --> 01:04:14,871
- I'll take the kids in the car.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Bailey. Thank you.

1189
01:04:14,981 --> 01:04:17,848
All right, kids, here. Here, get in here.

1190
01:04:17,984 --> 01:04:20,111
Now, one at a time.
Get right up on the seat there.

1191
01:04:21,688 --> 01:04:25,317
- Sit down, there.
- Here, now, get the dog, now. That's it.

1192
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:28,754
- Goat, too.
- Everybody!

1193
01:04:29,062 --> 01:04:30,393
All in!

1194
01:04:32,632 --> 01:04:34,497
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

1195
01:04:37,203 --> 01:04:38,295
All in?

1196
01:04:57,323 --> 01:04:59,723
Mr. And Mrs. Martini, welcome home.

1197
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:02,785
Good old George,
he's always making a speech.

1198
01:05:03,863 --> 01:05:05,160
Hee-haw!

1199
01:05:05,398 --> 01:05:08,993
- Sam Wainwright.
- Oh, who cares.

1200
01:05:09,569 --> 01:05:12,697
Bread. That this house
may never know hunger.

1201
01:05:13,473 --> 01:05:16,806
Salt. That life may always have flavor.

1202
01:05:17,243 --> 01:05:20,679
And wine. That joy and prosperity
may reign forever.

1203
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:22,509
Enter the Martini castle.

1204
01:05:24,384 --> 01:05:26,818
Look, Mr. Potter,
it's no skin off my nose.

1205
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,717
I'm just your little rent collector.

1206
01:05:28,821 --> 01:05:31,619
But you can't laugh off
this Bailey Park anymore.

1207
01:05:31,724 --> 01:05:32,816
Look at it.

1208
01:05:33,726 --> 01:05:35,717
Congressman Black is here
to see you, sir.

1209
01:05:35,828 --> 01:05:38,763
Oh, tell the Congressman to wait.
Go on.

1210
01:05:38,898 --> 01:05:41,662
Fifteen years ago, a half a dozen
houses stuck here and there.

1211
01:05:41,768 --> 01:05:43,998
There's the old cemetery, squirrels,
buttercups, daisies.

1212
01:05:44,103 --> 01:05:46,264
I used to hunt rabbits there myself.

1213
01:05:47,173 --> 01:05:48,470
Look at it today.

1214
01:05:48,641 --> 01:05:51,439
Dozens of the prettiest little homes
you ever saw,

1215
01:05:51,644 --> 01:05:54,841
90% owned by suckers
who used to pay rent to you.

1216
01:05:54,948 --> 01:05:58,247
Your Potter's Field, my dear
Mr. Employer, is becoming just that.

1217
01:05:58,351 --> 01:06:01,787
And are the local yokels making with
those David and Goliath wisecracks.

1218
01:06:01,888 --> 01:06:03,617
Oh, they are, are they?

1219
01:06:03,723 --> 01:06:06,624
Even though they know
the Baileys never made a dime out of it.

1220
01:06:06,726 --> 01:06:09,194
You know very well why.
The Baileys were all chumps.

1221
01:06:09,295 --> 01:06:11,229
Every one of these homes is worth

1222
01:06:11,331 --> 01:06:13,424
twice what it cost
the Building and Loan to build.

1223
01:06:13,533 --> 01:06:15,967
- Lf I were you, Mr. Potter...
- You are not me.

1224
01:06:16,069 --> 01:06:19,527
As I say, it's no skin off my nose,

1225
01:06:22,675 --> 01:06:24,609
but one of these days
this bright young man

1226
01:06:24,711 --> 01:06:27,305
is gonna be asking
George Bailey for a job.

1227
01:06:29,749 --> 01:06:32,843
The Bailey family has been
a boil on my neck long enough.

1228
01:06:32,952 --> 01:06:35,011
- Yes, sir?
- Come in here.

1229
01:06:35,388 --> 01:06:37,549
We just stopped in town
to take a look at the new factory,

1230
01:06:37,657 --> 01:06:39,625
and then we're gonna
drive on down to Florida.

1231
01:06:39,726 --> 01:06:41,353
Why don't you
have your friends join us?

1232
01:06:41,461 --> 01:06:44,828
Why, sure. Hey, why don't you kids
drive down with us, huh?

1233
01:06:45,231 --> 01:06:47,995
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.

1234
01:06:48,101 --> 01:06:50,126
Still got the nose
to the old grindstone, eh?

1235
01:06:50,236 --> 01:06:53,797
Jane, I offered to let George in
on the ground floor in plastics,

1236
01:06:53,906 --> 01:06:55,066
and he turned me down cold.

1237
01:06:55,174 --> 01:06:57,938
- Oh, now, don't rub it in.
- I'm not rubbing it in.

1238
01:06:58,044 --> 01:06:59,636
Well, I guess we better run along.

1239
01:06:59,746 --> 01:07:01,771
- Awfully happy to have met you, Mary.
- Nice meeting you, too.

1240
01:07:01,881 --> 01:07:03,246
- Goodbye. Glad to see you.
- Goodbye, George.

1241
01:07:03,349 --> 01:07:04,782
So long, George.
See you in the funny papers.

1242
01:07:04,884 --> 01:07:06,943
- So long, Mary.
- Bye, Sam. Have fun.

1243
01:07:07,053 --> 01:07:09,044
- Thanks for dropping around.
- Florida!

1244
01:07:09,155 --> 01:07:10,816
- Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw.

1245
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:41,819
Thank you, sir.

1246
01:07:42,425 --> 01:07:44,393
- That's quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
- You like it?

1247
01:07:44,494 --> 01:07:46,018
I'll send you a box.

1248
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,132
Well, I...

1249
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,207
I suppose I'll find out sooner or later,

1250
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:02,142
but just what exactly
did you want to see me about?

1251
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,841
George, now that's just what I like
so much about you.

1252
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:12,013
George, I am an old man,
and most people hate me.

1253
01:08:12,122 --> 01:08:15,091
But I don't like them, either,
so that makes it all even.

1254
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:17,352
You know just as well as I do

1255
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,951
that I run practically everything
in this town

1256
01:08:20,063 --> 01:08:22,623
but the Bailey Building and Loan.

1257
01:08:23,133 --> 01:08:27,194
You know, also, that for a number of
years I've been trying to get control of it.

1258
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:29,897
Or kill it. But I haven't been able to do it.

1259
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:32,074
You have been stopping me.

1260
01:08:33,209 --> 01:08:36,337
In fact, you have beaten me, George,

1261
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:40,883
and as anyone in this county
can tell you, that takes some doing.

1262
01:08:42,018 --> 01:08:44,680
Take during the Depression,
for instance.

1263
01:08:44,821 --> 01:08:47,881
You and I were the only ones
that kept our heads.

1264
01:08:47,991 --> 01:08:51,927
You saved the Building and Loan.
I saved all the rest.

1265
01:08:52,028 --> 01:08:54,656
Yes. Well, most people say
you stole all the rest.

1266
01:08:54,764 --> 01:08:58,029
The envious ones say that,
George, the suckers.

1267
01:08:59,035 --> 01:09:03,062
Now, I have stated my side very frankly.

1268
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:05,566
Now let's look at your side.

1269
01:09:06,543 --> 01:09:13,415
Young man, 27-28, married,
making, say, $40 a week.

1270
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:15,483
- $45.
- $45.

1271
01:09:15,585 --> 01:09:16,677
$45.

1272
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:20,954
Out of which, after supporting
your mother and paying your bills,

1273
01:09:21,057 --> 01:09:24,117
you're able to keep, say, $10,
if you skimp.

1274
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:28,560
A child or two comes along, and you
won't even be able to save the $10.

1275
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:34,160
Now, if this young man of 28
was a common, ordinary yokel,

1276
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:35,828
I'd say he was doing fine.

1277
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:40,205
But George Bailey is not a common,
ordinary yokel.

1278
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:43,973
He is an intelligent, smart,
ambitious young man,

1279
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:47,277
who hates his job,
who hates the Building and Loan

1280
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:49,010
almost as much as I do.

1281
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:54,314
A young man who's been dying to get
out on his own ever since he was born.

1282
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:57,555
A young man... The smartest one
of the crowd, mind you.

1283
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:59,252
A young man who has to sit by

1284
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:02,798
and watch his friends go places
because he's trapped.

1285
01:10:02,899 --> 01:10:06,528
Yes, sir,
trapped into frittering his life away,

1286
01:10:06,636 --> 01:10:09,196
playing nursemaid
to a lot of garlic eaters.

1287
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:13,972
Do I paint a correct picture,
or do I exaggerate?

1288
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:19,004
- Now, what's your point, Mr. Potter?
- My point?

1289
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:21,675
- My point is I want to hire you.
- Hire me?

1290
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:25,015
Yeah, I want you to manage my affairs,
run my properties.

1291
01:10:25,288 --> 01:10:30,351
George, I'll start you out
at $20,000 a year.

1292
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:37,131
$20,000 a year?

1293
01:10:37,267 --> 01:10:40,634
You wouldn't mind living
in the nicest house in town,

1294
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:43,399
buying your wife a lot of fine clothes,

1295
01:10:43,506 --> 01:10:46,270
a couple of business trips
to New York a year,

1296
01:10:46,376 --> 01:10:48,207
maybe once in a while Europe.

1297
01:10:48,311 --> 01:10:49,608
You wouldn't mind that,
would you, George?

1298
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:51,043
Would I?

1299
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,381
You're not talking to somebody else
around here, are you?

1300
01:10:56,486 --> 01:10:58,181
You know, this is me.
You remember me?

1301
01:10:58,288 --> 01:11:00,051
- George Bailey.
- George Bailey.

1302
01:11:00,156 --> 01:11:03,182
Yeah, George Bailey,
whose ship has just come in.

1303
01:11:04,527 --> 01:11:07,724
Provided he has enough brains
to climb aboard.

1304
01:11:16,072 --> 01:11:17,471
Holy mackerel.

1305
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:23,101
Well, how about the Building and Loan?

1306
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:26,613
Oh, confound it, man,
are you afraid of success?

1307
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:31,652
I'm offering you a three-years contract
at $20,000 a year, starting today.

1308
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:33,449
Is it a deal, or isn't it?

1309
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:36,751
Well, Mr. Potter, I...

1310
01:11:36,993 --> 01:11:40,759
I know I ought to jump
at the chance but I... I just...

1311
01:11:41,898 --> 01:11:45,925
I wonder if it would be possible for you
to give me 24 hours to think it over?

1312
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:47,696
Sure, sure, sure.

1313
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:50,329
You go on home
and talk about it to your wife.

1314
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,964
I'd like to do that.

1315
01:11:52,075 --> 01:11:54,407
Yeah. In the meantime,
I'll draw up the papers.

1316
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:56,375
- All right, sir.
- Okay, George?

1317
01:11:57,914 --> 01:11:59,404
Okay, Mr. Potter.

1318
01:12:07,623 --> 01:12:11,889
No. No. No, no,
now wait a minute, here.

1319
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:15,628
I don't need 24 hours.
I don't have to talk to anybody.

1320
01:12:15,732 --> 01:12:19,429
I know right now, and the answer is no.
No, doggone it!

1321
01:12:19,569 --> 01:12:22,003
You sit around here,
and you spin your little webs,

1322
01:12:22,105 --> 01:12:24,573
and you think the whole world
revolves around you and your money.

1323
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:26,198
Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter.

1324
01:12:26,309 --> 01:12:29,472
In the whole vast configuration of things,

1325
01:12:29,579 --> 01:12:32,343
I'd say you were nothing
but a scurvy little spider.

1326
01:12:32,448 --> 01:12:33,415
You...

1327
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:37,010
And that goes for you, too!

1328
01:12:41,124 --> 01:12:43,183
And it goes for you, too!

1329
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:53,191
You wouldn't mind living
in the nicest house in town,

1330
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:56,229
buying your wife a lot of fine clothes,

1331
01:12:56,506 --> 01:12:59,998
going to New York on a business trip
a couple of times a year,

1332
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:02,304
maybe Europe once in a while.

1333
01:13:03,312 --> 01:13:05,405
I know what I'm gonna do tomorrow

1334
01:13:05,515 --> 01:13:08,712
and the next day and next year
and the year after that.

1335
01:13:08,818 --> 01:13:11,946
I'm shaking the dust
of this crummy little town off my feet,

1336
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,851
and I'm gonna see the world.

1337
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:16,686
And then I'm gonna build things.
I'm gonna build air fields.

1338
01:13:16,793 --> 01:13:19,353
I'm gonna build skyscrapers
100 stories high.

1339
01:13:19,462 --> 01:13:21,828
I'm gonna build a bridge a mile long.

1340
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:26,260
What is it you want, Mary?
What, you want the moon?

1341
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:29,303
If you do, just say the word,
I'll throw a lasso around it

1342
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,100
and pull her down for you.

1343
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,831
Buffalo gal
Won't you come out tonight?

1344
01:13:33,943 --> 01:13:36,810
Won't you come out tonight?
Won't you come out tonight?

1345
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:39,848
Buffalo gal
Won't you come out tonight

1346
01:13:39,949 --> 01:13:41,610
And

1347
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:49,982
- Hi.
- Hi.

1348
01:13:55,498 --> 01:13:56,760
Mary Hatch,

1349
01:13:59,302 --> 01:14:02,066
why in the world
did you ever marry a guy like me?

1350
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:05,700
To keep from being an old maid.

1351
01:14:06,209 --> 01:14:07,642
You could have
married Sam Wainwright

1352
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,438
and anybody else in town.

1353
01:14:09,846 --> 01:14:12,508
I didn't want
to marry anybody else in town.

1354
01:14:13,616 --> 01:14:15,584
I want my baby to look like you.

1355
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:17,742
You didn't even have a honeymoon.

1356
01:14:17,854 --> 01:14:19,185
I promised you...

1357
01:14:20,056 --> 01:14:22,320
- Your what?
- My baby.

1358
01:14:25,094 --> 01:14:26,584
Your... Your...

1359
01:14:27,497 --> 01:14:29,158
Mary, you on the nest?

1360
01:14:29,432 --> 01:14:33,334
- George Bailey lassoes stork.
- Lassoes a stork!

1361
01:14:37,373 --> 01:14:41,275
You mean you...
What is it, a boy or a girl?

1362
01:14:44,914 --> 01:14:49,408
Now, you've probably already guessed
that George never leaves Bedford Falls.

1363
01:14:49,519 --> 01:14:53,216
- No!
- Mary had her baby, a boy.

1364
01:14:53,956 --> 01:14:56,015
Then she had another one, a girl.

1365
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:58,316
Day after day she worked away,

1366
01:14:58,427 --> 01:15:01,328
remaking the old Granville house
into a home.

1367
01:15:01,564 --> 01:15:05,091
Night after night,
George came back late from the office.

1368
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:11,066
Potter was bearing down hard.

1369
01:15:16,312 --> 01:15:17,904
Then came a war.

1370
01:15:18,748 --> 01:15:22,309
Ma Bailey and Mrs. Hatch
joined the Red Cross and sewed.

1371
01:15:22,785 --> 01:15:26,881
Mary had two more babies
but still found time to run the USO.

1372
01:15:27,123 --> 01:15:30,650
Sam Wainwright made a fortune
in plastic hoods for planes.

1373
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,360
Potter became head of the draft board.

1374
01:15:33,796 --> 01:15:35,127
One-A.

1375
01:15:36,299 --> 01:15:37,527
One-A.

1376
01:15:40,436 --> 01:15:41,528
One-A.

1377
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:44,339
Gower and Uncle Billy sold war bonds.

1378
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:48,767
Bert the cop was wounded
in North Africa, got the Silver Star.

1379
01:15:49,345 --> 01:15:52,610
Ernie the taxi driver
parachuted into France.

1380
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:56,109
Marty helped capture
the Remagen Bridge.

1381
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:57,610
Harry...

1382
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,984
Harry Bailey topped them all.

1383
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:04,018
A Navy flier, he shot down 15 planes,

1384
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:08,426
two of them as they were about
to crash into a transport full of soldiers.

1385
01:16:10,099 --> 01:16:12,431
- Yes, but George.
- George?

1386
01:16:12,702 --> 01:16:14,636
Four-F on account of his ear,

1387
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:17,171
George fought the battle
of Bedford Falls.

1388
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:20,038
Now, hold on! Hold on! Hold on now!

1389
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:21,666
Don't you know there's a war on?

1390
01:16:21,777 --> 01:16:23,540
Air raid warden.

1391
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:33,754
Paper drives.

1392
01:16:33,856 --> 01:16:35,187
Scrap drives.

1393
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:36,690
Rubber drives.

1394
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:41,422
Like everybody else on VE Day,
he wept and prayed.

1395
01:16:42,398 --> 01:16:47,131
On VJ Day, he wept and prayed again.

1396
01:16:47,236 --> 01:16:49,670
Joseph, now show him
what happened today.

1397
01:16:49,772 --> 01:16:50,238
Yes, sir.

1398
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:54,168
This morning, day before Christmas,
about 10:00 a.m.

1399
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,800
Bedford Falls time...

1400
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:58,175
Hey, Ernie. Look at that.

1401
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:04,708
It's gonna snow again.

1402
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:08,085
What do you mean, it's gonna snow?
Look at the headlines. The President...

1403
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:10,624
I know, I know, George.
That's marvelous.

1404
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:12,216
Commander Harry Bailey!

1405
01:17:12,328 --> 01:17:14,819
Mr. Gower, look at this,
the second page.

1406
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:16,158
Now, look, this is for you.

1407
01:17:16,265 --> 01:17:17,698
- This is for you. That's for you.
- Okay.

1408
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,563
- Right, thanks.
- See you again.

1409
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:23,362
Be sure you spell the name right.

1410
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:36,040
Extra! Read all about it!

1411
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:38,586
George, George! It's Harry now
on long-distance from Washington.

1412
01:17:38,688 --> 01:17:40,178
Harry! What do you know about that!

1413
01:17:40,289 --> 01:17:41,779
He reversed the charges.
It's okay, isn't it?

1414
01:17:41,891 --> 01:17:44,155
Reversed the charges?
Of course it is for a hero.

1415
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:45,625
Harry!

1416
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:49,788
You old seven times
a son of a gun. Congratulations.

1417
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:52,467
How's Mother standing it? She did?

1418
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:54,063
What do you know?

1419
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,831
Mother had lunch
with the President's wife.

1420
01:17:55,938 --> 01:17:56,996
Wait till Martha hears about this.

1421
01:17:57,106 --> 01:17:59,233
- What did they have to eat?
- What'd they have to eat?

1422
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:00,330
Harry,

1423
01:18:00,443 --> 01:18:03,537
you should see what they're cooking up
in the town for you.

1424
01:18:03,646 --> 01:18:04,704
Oh, they are?

1425
01:18:04,814 --> 01:18:06,679
The Navy's gonna fly Mother home
this afternoon.

1426
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:07,874
In a plane?

1427
01:18:08,284 --> 01:18:10,411
What? Uncle Billy?

1428
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,851
- Has Uncle Billy come in yet?
- He stopped at the bank first.

1429
01:18:12,955 --> 01:18:16,391
He's not here right now, Harry.
But look, now, tell me about it.

1430
01:18:16,492 --> 01:18:17,516
- George. George, George.
- What?

1431
01:18:17,626 --> 01:18:18,718
- That man is here again.
- What man?

1432
01:18:18,828 --> 01:18:20,386
Bank examiner.

1433
01:18:21,497 --> 01:18:23,624
Harry, talk to Eustace for a minute,
will you?

1434
01:18:23,733 --> 01:18:24,893
I'll be right back.

1435
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,467
Well, Harry.

1436
01:18:26,569 --> 01:18:29,037
- Good morning, sir.
- Carter, bank examiner.

1437
01:18:29,138 --> 01:18:31,265
- Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1438
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,102
We're all excited around here.

1439
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:35,234
My brother just got
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

1440
01:18:35,344 --> 01:18:38,108
- The President just decorated him.
- Well, I guess they do those things.

1441
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:41,012
- Well, I trust you had a good year.
- Good year?

1442
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:44,310
Well, between you and me,
Mr. Carter, we're broke.

1443
01:18:44,587 --> 01:18:46,214
Yeah, very funny.

1444
01:18:48,424 --> 01:18:51,188
Well, now,
come right in here, Mr. Carter.

1445
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:53,523
Although I shouldn't wonder
when you okay reverse charges

1446
01:18:53,629 --> 01:18:55,358
on personal long-distance calls.

1447
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:57,022
- George, shall we hang up?
- No, no.

1448
01:18:57,133 --> 01:18:58,760
He wants to talk to Uncle Billy.
You just hold on, there.

1449
01:18:58,868 --> 01:19:01,632
Now, if you'll cooperate,
I'd like to finish with you by tonight.

1450
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:04,570
I want to spend Christmas
in Elmira with my family.

1451
01:19:04,673 --> 01:19:05,935
I don't blame you at all, Mr. Carter.

1452
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:07,303
Just step right in here. We'll fix you up.

1453
01:19:08,377 --> 01:19:11,403
December 24.

1454
01:19:17,019 --> 01:19:19,579
$8,000.

1455
01:19:20,723 --> 01:19:23,283
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter.
- Merry Christmas.

1456
01:19:23,392 --> 01:19:26,793
Well, good morning, Mr. Potter.
What's the news?

1457
01:19:26,896 --> 01:19:30,627
Well, well, well, "Harry Bailey
wins Congressional Medal."

1458
01:19:30,733 --> 01:19:32,792
That couldn't be one of the Bailey boys.

1459
01:19:32,902 --> 01:19:36,463
You just can't keep those Baileys down,
now can you, Mr. Potter?

1460
01:19:36,572 --> 01:19:38,972
How does slacker George
feel about that?

1461
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:40,302
Very jealous. Very jealous.

1462
01:19:40,409 --> 01:19:42,604
He only lost three buttons off his vest.

1463
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:44,736
Of course,
slacker George would've gotten

1464
01:19:44,847 --> 01:19:46,712
two of these medals if he had gone.

1465
01:19:46,816 --> 01:19:48,306
- Bad ear.
- Yes.

1466
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:51,953
After all, Potter, some people
like George had to stay at home.

1467
01:19:52,054 --> 01:19:56,047
Not every heel was
in Germany and Japan.

1468
01:20:03,399 --> 01:20:07,062
- Good morning, Mr. Bailey.
- Good morning, Horace.

1469
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:10,866
- I guess you forgot something.
- Huh?

1470
01:20:10,973 --> 01:20:12,804
- You forgot something.
- What?

1471
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:14,398
Well, aren't you going
to make a deposit?

1472
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:15,477
Oh, sure, sure I am.

1473
01:20:15,578 --> 01:20:18,945
Well, then, it's usually customary
to bring the money with you.

1474
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:22,685
Oh, shucks, I knew I had.

1475
01:20:22,685 --> 01:20:23,709
Oh, shucks, I knew I had.

1476
01:20:25,588 --> 01:20:27,647
How about that finger there?

1477
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:28,814
Well, I...

1478
01:20:29,725 --> 01:20:30,885
Bailey.

1479
01:20:37,433 --> 01:20:39,799
Take me back there. Hurry up.

1480
01:20:41,937 --> 01:20:44,132
Come on, look sharp.

1481
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,347
Take me back.

1482
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:16,535
Just make yourself at home, Mr. Carter.
I got those books for you here.

1483
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:18,038
Oh, hello, Vi.

1484
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:19,698
George, can I see you for a second?

1485
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:22,641
Why, of course you can.
Go on in the office there.

1486
01:21:22,845 --> 01:21:25,643
Uncle Billy, talk to Harry.
He's on the telephone.

1487
01:21:26,482 --> 01:21:29,246
Hurry up, Uncle Billy, hurry.
Long distance, Washington.

1488
01:21:29,351 --> 01:21:30,443
Hey, here's Harry on the phone.

1489
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:32,281
You know, your nephew,
remember? Harry.

1490
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:33,616
- Here he is.
- Hurry up.

1491
01:21:34,156 --> 01:21:37,887
Hello? Hello.
Yes, Harry, yes, everything's fine.

1492
01:21:38,427 --> 01:21:40,588
I ought to have my head examined.

1493
01:21:40,696 --> 01:21:43,563
$8,000. It's got to be somewhere.

1494
01:21:49,772 --> 01:21:50,966
Here you are.

1495
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:52,631
Character?

1496
01:21:53,309 --> 01:21:54,571
If I had any character, I'd...

1497
01:21:54,677 --> 01:21:58,078
It takes a lot of character to leave
your hometown and start all over again.

1498
01:21:58,180 --> 01:21:59,647
No, George, don't.

1499
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:01,739
Here now, you're broke, aren't you?

1500
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:03,442
- I know, but...
- What do you want to do,

1501
01:22:03,552 --> 01:22:05,315
hock your furs and that hat?

1502
01:22:06,722 --> 01:22:08,189
You want to walk to New York?

1503
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:10,053
You know, they charge
for meals and rent up there,

1504
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:11,558
just the same as they do
in Bedford Falls.

1505
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,423
- Yeah, sure.
- No, that's a loan, now.

1506
01:22:13,729 --> 01:22:15,993
That's my business, Building and Loan.

1507
01:22:16,198 --> 01:22:19,224
Besides, you'll get a job.
Good luck to you.

1508
01:22:19,335 --> 01:22:21,462
I'm glad I know you, George Bailey.

1509
01:22:26,709 --> 01:22:29,439
- Say hello to New York for me.
- Yeah, yeah, sure, I will.

1510
01:22:29,545 --> 01:22:31,410
Now, let's hear from you
once in a while.

1511
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:38,682
- Merry Christmas, Vi.
- Merry Christmas, George.

1512
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:42,089
- Mr. Bailey.
- Oh, Mr. Carter, I'm sorry.

1513
01:22:42,191 --> 01:22:43,658
I'll be right with you.
Uncle Billy in there?

1514
01:22:43,759 --> 01:22:45,249
Yeah, he's in his office.

1515
01:22:45,361 --> 01:22:47,522
What's going on?

1516
01:22:47,763 --> 01:22:49,731
The bank examiner's here.

1517
01:22:50,566 --> 01:22:53,467
- He's here?
- Yeah. He wants the accounts payable...

1518
01:22:53,602 --> 01:22:55,160
What's the matter with you?

1519
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:56,669
Come here.

1520
01:23:16,959 --> 01:23:17,926
Eustace.

1521
01:23:18,027 --> 01:23:19,722
- Yeah?
- Come here a minute.

1522
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:23,761
Did you see Uncle Billy
with any cash last night?

1523
01:23:23,866 --> 01:23:26,300
He had it on his desk counting it
before he closed up.

1524
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:29,061
Now, look, did you buy anything?

1525
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:31,469
- Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
- All right, all right.

1526
01:23:31,573 --> 01:23:34,167
Now, we'll go over every step you took
since you left the house.

1527
01:23:34,276 --> 01:23:35,243
- Right. This way.
- Come on.

1528
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:47,188
And did you put the envelope
in your pocket?

1529
01:23:47,289 --> 01:23:50,383
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

1530
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:53,290
Maybe! I don't want any maybe.
We've got to find that money!

1531
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:54,885
- I'm no good to you, George.
- Uncle Billy, look,

1532
01:23:54,997 --> 01:23:57,557
do you realize what's going
to happen if we don't find it?

1533
01:23:57,666 --> 01:23:58,690
Listen to me.

1534
01:23:58,801 --> 01:24:00,564
Do you have any secret hiding place
here in the house?

1535
01:24:00,669 --> 01:24:02,694
Someplace you would have...
Someplace you hide the money?

1536
01:24:02,805 --> 01:24:04,397
I've gone over the whole house,

1537
01:24:04,506 --> 01:24:08,408
even in rooms that have been locked
since I lost Laura.

1538
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:11,604
Listen to me, listen to me! Think, think!

1539
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:15,809
I can't think anymore, George.
I can't think anymore. It hurts.

1540
01:24:15,918 --> 01:24:18,785
Where's that money,
you silly, stupid old fool?

1541
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:21,617
Where's that money?
Do you realize what this means?

1542
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:24,692
It means bankruptcy and scandal
and prison!

1543
01:24:25,861 --> 01:24:27,158
That's what it means.

1544
01:24:27,262 --> 01:24:30,459
One of us is going to jail.
Well, it's not going to be me.

1545
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:54,347
Hello, darling.

1546
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:56,219
- Hello, Daddy.
- Hello, Daddy.

1547
01:24:56,325 --> 01:24:58,156
How do you like it?

1548
01:24:58,260 --> 01:24:59,921
- Bless you!
- Bless you!

1549
01:25:01,697 --> 01:25:02,857
Did you bring the wreath?

1550
01:25:02,965 --> 01:25:04,762
Yes, Daddy, did you bring
the Christmas wreath?

1551
01:25:04,867 --> 01:25:05,856
What wreath?

1552
01:25:05,968 --> 01:25:08,402
The Merry Christmas wreath
for the window.

1553
01:25:08,504 --> 01:25:09,801
No. I left it at the office.

1554
01:25:09,905 --> 01:25:11,873
- Is it snowing?
- Yeah, it just started.

1555
01:25:11,974 --> 01:25:15,000
- Where's your coat and hat?
- Left them at the office.

1556
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:16,268
What's the matter?

1557
01:25:16,378 --> 01:25:18,903
Nothing's the matter.
Everything's all right.

1558
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:29,921
Come on, Pete, you're a big boy.
You can help me get this star up.

1559
01:25:30,025 --> 01:25:32,994
Way up at the top. There. That's it.

1560
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:37,395
All right, fill in that little bare spot
right there. Right there.

1561
01:25:39,668 --> 01:25:43,126
Isn't it wonderful about Harry?
We're famous, George.

1562
01:25:43,238 --> 01:25:46,969
Bet I had 50 calls today
about the parade, the banquet.

1563
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:49,201
Your mother's so excited. She...

1564
01:26:09,865 --> 01:26:12,333
Must she keep playing that?

1565
01:26:12,434 --> 01:26:15,232
I have to practice it
for the party tonight, Daddy.

1566
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:18,397
Mama said we could stay up
till midnight and sing Christmas carols.

1567
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:19,974
Can you sing, Daddy?

1568
01:26:20,409 --> 01:26:21,967
Better hurry and shave.

1569
01:26:22,077 --> 01:26:25,012
- The families will be here soon.
- Families.

1570
01:26:25,113 --> 01:26:27,547
I don't want the families over here.

1571
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:32,377
Come on out in the kitchen with me
while I finish dinner.

1572
01:26:32,487 --> 01:26:35,547
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1573
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:37,818
- Have a hectic day?
- Oh, yeah.

1574
01:26:37,926 --> 01:26:40,793
Another big red-letter day
for the Baileys.

1575
01:26:41,296 --> 01:26:44,129
Daddy, the Browns next door
have a new car. You should see it.

1576
01:26:44,233 --> 01:26:46,701
Well, what's the matter with our car?
Isn't it good enough for you?

1577
01:26:46,802 --> 01:26:47,769
Yes, Daddy.

1578
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:50,303
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1579
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:52,600
- Excuse you for what?
- I burped.

1580
01:26:53,742 --> 01:26:55,107
All right, darling, you're excused.

1581
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,940
Now, go on upstairs
and see if little Zuzu wants anything.

1582
01:26:58,513 --> 01:27:02,813
- Zuzu? What's the matter with Zuzu?
- Oh, she's just got a cold. She's in bed.

1583
01:27:02,918 --> 01:27:04,351
Caught it coming home from school.

1584
01:27:04,453 --> 01:27:06,978
They gave her a flower for a prize,
and she didn't want to crush it,

1585
01:27:07,089 --> 01:27:08,283
so she didn't button up her coat.

1586
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:10,551
- What is it, a sore throat or what?
- It's just a cold.

1587
01:27:10,659 --> 01:27:11,921
- The doctor says it's nothing serious.
- The doctor?

1588
01:27:12,027 --> 01:27:13,756
- Was the doctor here?
- Yes, I called him right away.

1589
01:27:13,862 --> 01:27:15,090
He says it's nothing to worry about.

1590
01:27:15,197 --> 01:27:16,459
Is she running a temperature?
What is it?

1591
01:27:16,565 --> 01:27:18,624
Just a teensy one, 99.6.
She'll be all right.

1592
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:20,201
Of course, it's this old house.

1593
01:27:20,302 --> 01:27:22,497
I don't know why
we don't all have pneumonia.

1594
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:26,870
Drafty old barn.
Might as well be living in a refrigerator.

1595
01:27:27,142 --> 01:27:28,871
Why did we have
to live here in the first place

1596
01:27:28,977 --> 01:27:32,071
and stay around this measly,
crummy old town?

1597
01:27:32,881 --> 01:27:35,441
- George, what's wrong?
- Wrong! Everything's wrong.

1598
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:38,815
You call this a happy family?
Why do we have to have all these kids?

1599
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:42,583
- Dad, how do you spell "frankincense"?
- I don't know. Ask your mother.

1600
01:27:42,691 --> 01:27:44,420
- Where're you going?
- I'm going up to see Zuzu.

1601
01:27:44,526 --> 01:27:46,892
He told me to write a play for tomorrow.

1602
01:27:57,773 --> 01:28:01,504
F-r-a-n-k-i-n...

1603
01:28:01,743 --> 01:28:03,074
Hi, Daddy!

1604
01:28:04,246 --> 01:28:07,409
- Well, what happened to you?
- I won a flower.

1605
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:09,580
Wait now.
Where do you think you're going?

1606
01:28:09,685 --> 01:28:11,312
I want to give my flower a drink.

1607
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:13,615
All right, all right.
Now, give Daddy the flower.

1608
01:28:13,722 --> 01:28:15,019
I'll give it a drink.

1609
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:16,420
Now, here.

1610
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,052
Look, Daddy!

1611
01:28:20,195 --> 01:28:21,560
Paste it!

1612
01:28:21,663 --> 01:28:24,154
Yeah, all right, all right. Give it here.

1613
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:29,160
Now, we'll paste this together here.

1614
01:28:32,407 --> 01:28:35,535
There. There it is. Good as new.

1615
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:37,737
Now, give the flower a drink.

1616
01:28:37,846 --> 01:28:39,279
Now, will you do something for me?

1617
01:28:39,381 --> 01:28:42,077
- What?
- Will you try to get some sleep?

1618
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:45,218
I'm not sleepy.
I want to look at my flower.

1619
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:49,723
I know, I know, but you just go to sleep
and then you can dream about it,

1620
01:28:50,058 --> 01:28:52,185
and it'll be a whole garden.

1621
01:28:52,294 --> 01:28:53,522
It will?

1622
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:03,733
- Telephone!
- Telephone!

1623
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:05,238
I'll get it.

1624
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:08,335
Hello?

1625
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:11,268
Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey.

1626
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,547
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch.
I'm sure she'll be all right.

1627
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:16,241
The doctor said
that she ought to be out of bed

1628
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:17,545
in time to have her Christmas dinner.

1629
01:29:17,652 --> 01:29:19,176
- Is that Zuzu's teacher?
- Yes.

1630
01:29:19,287 --> 01:29:20,618
Let me speak to her.

1631
01:29:20,722 --> 01:29:23,122
Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch?

1632
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:25,983
This is George Bailey. I'm Zuzu's father.

1633
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:27,789
Say, what kind of a teacher
are you, anyway?

1634
01:29:27,896 --> 01:29:30,160
What do you mean
sending her home like that, half naked?

1635
01:29:30,265 --> 01:29:32,790
Do you realize she'll probably end up
with pneumonia on account of you?

1636
01:29:32,901 --> 01:29:34,835
- George!
- Is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for

1637
01:29:34,936 --> 01:29:37,029
to have teachers like you?

1638
01:29:37,139 --> 01:29:40,370
Stupid, silly, careless people who send
our kids home without any clothes on?

1639
01:29:40,475 --> 01:29:42,306
You know, maybe my kids
aren't the best-dressed kids.

1640
01:29:42,411 --> 01:29:44,106
And maybe they don't have
any decent clothes...

1641
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:45,975
That stupid...

1642
01:29:46,748 --> 01:29:49,615
Hello, Mrs. Welch. I want to apologize...

1643
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:51,811
Hello? Hello.

1644
01:29:53,622 --> 01:29:56,022
- She's hung up!
- I'll hang her up!

1645
01:29:56,124 --> 01:29:59,287
- Hey, you! I'll knock your block off!
- What is that?

1646
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:01,191
Hello! Who's this?

1647
01:30:01,296 --> 01:30:02,786
Oh, Mr. Welch?

1648
01:30:03,198 --> 01:30:04,665
Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch.

1649
01:30:04,766 --> 01:30:06,791
Give me a chance to tell you
what I really think of your wife.

1650
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:07,926
George, stop it.

1651
01:30:08,036 --> 01:30:09,731
Will you get out and let me handle this?

1652
01:30:09,838 --> 01:30:12,329
Hello? Hello? What?

1653
01:30:14,109 --> 01:30:15,633
Oh, you will, huh?

1654
01:30:15,744 --> 01:30:18,645
Okay, Mr. Welch. Any time
you think you're man enough, you...

1655
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:20,237
Hello! Any...

1656
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:25,417
Dad, how do you spell "hallelujah"?

1657
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,511
How should I know?
What do you think I am, a dictionary?

1658
01:30:27,622 --> 01:30:28,850
Tommy, stop that! Stop it!

1659
01:30:28,957 --> 01:30:30,788
Janie, haven't you learned
that silly tune yet?

1660
01:30:30,892 --> 01:30:34,589
You play it over and over again.
Now stop it! Stop it!

1661
01:31:01,723 --> 01:31:03,315
I'm sorry, Mary.

1662
01:31:06,628 --> 01:31:08,493
Janie, I'm sorry.

1663
01:31:09,197 --> 01:31:13,327
I didn't mean that. I...
You go on and practice.

1664
01:31:18,907 --> 01:31:21,239
Pete, I owe you an apology, too.

1665
01:31:22,544 --> 01:31:23,875
I'm sorry.

1666
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:28,146
- What do you want to know?
- Nothing, Daddy.

1667
01:31:35,123 --> 01:31:36,886
What's the matter with everybody?

1668
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:39,517
Janie, go on. I told you to practice.
Now, go on, play!

1669
01:31:39,628 --> 01:31:40,925
Oh, Daddy!

1670
01:31:46,368 --> 01:31:49,769
George, why must you
torture the children? Why don't you...

1671
01:31:50,572 --> 01:31:51,766
Mary...

1672
01:32:05,887 --> 01:32:07,787
Bedford 247, please.

1673
01:32:07,889 --> 01:32:09,880
- Is Daddy in trouble?
- Yes, Pete.

1674
01:32:09,991 --> 01:32:13,051
- Shall I pray for him?
- Yes, Janie, pray very hard.

1675
01:32:13,161 --> 01:32:15,152
- Me, too?
- You, too, Tommy.

1676
01:32:16,231 --> 01:32:18,131
Hello? Uncle Billy?

1677
01:32:18,733 --> 01:32:19,529
I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter.

1678
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:22,367
I need help.

1679
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:26,405
Through some sort of an accident,
my company's short in their accounts.

1680
01:32:26,508 --> 01:32:28,305
The bank examiner got there today.

1681
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:30,605
I've got to raise $8,000 immediately.

1682
01:32:30,712 --> 01:32:33,180
Oh, that's what the reporters wanted
to talk to you about?

1683
01:32:33,281 --> 01:32:34,578
- The reporters?
- Yes.

1684
01:32:34,683 --> 01:32:38,050
They called me up
from your Building and Loan.

1685
01:32:38,353 --> 01:32:41,720
Oh, there's a man over there
from the D.A.'s office, too.

1686
01:32:41,823 --> 01:32:43,017
He's looking for you.

1687
01:32:43,124 --> 01:32:46,719
Please help me, Mr. Potter.
Help me, won't you, please?

1688
01:32:46,828 --> 01:32:48,659
Can't you see what it means
to my family?

1689
01:32:48,763 --> 01:32:51,561
I'll pay any sort of a bonus on the loan,
any interest,

1690
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:53,224
if you still want the Building and Loan...

1691
01:32:53,335 --> 01:32:56,827
George, could it possibly be there's
a slight discrepancy in the books?

1692
01:32:56,938 --> 01:32:58,428
No, sir.
There's nothing wrong with the books.

1693
01:32:58,540 --> 01:33:01,532
I've just misplaced $8,000.
I can't find it anywhere.

1694
01:33:01,643 --> 01:33:05,579
- You misplaced $8,000?
- Yes, sir.

1695
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:12,277
- Have you notified the police?
- No, sir. I didn't want the publicity.

1696
01:33:12,387 --> 01:33:16,448
- Harry's homecoming tomorrow...
- They're going to believe that one.

1697
01:33:16,558 --> 01:33:18,822
What've you been doing, George?

1698
01:33:18,927 --> 01:33:20,622
Playing the market
with the company's money?

1699
01:33:20,729 --> 01:33:21,855
No, sir. No, sir, I haven't.

1700
01:33:21,963 --> 01:33:23,931
Is it a woman, then?

1701
01:33:24,032 --> 01:33:27,593
You know, it's all over town that
you've been giving money to Violet Bick.

1702
01:33:27,702 --> 01:33:28,726
What?

1703
01:33:28,837 --> 01:33:31,533
Not that it makes any difference to me,
but why did you come to me?

1704
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:34,336
Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright
and ask him for the money?

1705
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:36,034
I can't get a hold of him. He's in Europe.

1706
01:33:36,144 --> 01:33:37,543
Well, what about all your other friends?

1707
01:33:37,646 --> 01:33:39,944
They don't have that kind of money,
Mr. Potter. You know that.

1708
01:33:40,048 --> 01:33:41,913
You're the only one in town
that can help me.

1709
01:33:43,184 --> 01:33:46,449
I've suddenly become quite important.

1710
01:33:47,322 --> 01:33:49,950
What kind of security
would I have, George?

1711
01:33:50,058 --> 01:33:53,357
- Have you got any stocks?
- No, sir.

1712
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:56,259
Bonds? Real estate?
Collateral of any kind?

1713
01:33:56,831 --> 01:34:00,995
I have some life insurance,
a $15,000 policy.

1714
01:34:01,102 --> 01:34:04,765
- Yes. How much is your equity in it?
- Five hundred dollars.

1715
01:34:04,973 --> 01:34:06,770
Five hundred dollars?

1716
01:34:07,242 --> 01:34:09,836
And you ask me to lend you $8,000?

1717
01:34:11,446 --> 01:34:14,506
Look at you. You used to be so cocky.

1718
01:34:14,883 --> 01:34:17,909
You were going to go out
and conquer the world.

1719
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:23,253
You once called me a warped,
frustrated old man.

1720
01:34:23,992 --> 01:34:27,325
What are you but a warped,
frustrated young man?

1721
01:34:27,929 --> 01:34:29,487
A miserable little clerk,

1722
01:34:29,597 --> 01:34:31,258
crawling in here
on your hands and knees

1723
01:34:31,366 --> 01:34:33,197
and begging for help.

1724
01:34:33,435 --> 01:34:35,335
No securities, no stocks, no bonds.

1725
01:34:35,437 --> 01:34:39,066
Nothing but a miserable
little $500 equity

1726
01:34:39,174 --> 01:34:41,335
in a life insurance policy.

1727
01:34:42,177 --> 01:34:44,577
You're worth more dead than alive.

1728
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:48,049
Why don't you go to the riffraff
you love so much

1729
01:34:48,149 --> 01:34:50,640
and ask them to let you have $8,000?

1730
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:52,313
You know why?

1731
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:55,116
Because they'd run you
out of town on a rail.

1732
01:34:55,223 --> 01:34:58,386
But I tell you
what I'm going to do for you, George.

1733
01:34:58,493 --> 01:35:01,656
Since the state examiner is still here,

1734
01:35:01,763 --> 01:35:04,288
as a stockholder
of the Building and Loan,

1735
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:07,300
I'm going to swear out
a warrant for your arrest.

1736
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:11,729
Misappropriation of funds,
manipulation, malfeasance.

1737
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:15,740
All right, George, go ahead.

1738
01:35:15,844 --> 01:35:18,677
You can't hide in a little town like this.

1739
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:21,141
Yeah, Bill? This is Potter.

1740
01:35:34,963 --> 01:35:38,194
Merry Christmas! Glad you come!

1741
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,427
How about some of that good spaghetti?

1742
01:35:40,535 --> 01:35:42,196
We got everything.

1743
01:35:53,348 --> 01:35:54,576
Oh, God.

1744
01:35:57,919 --> 01:35:59,147
Oh, God.

1745
01:36:04,225 --> 01:36:06,056
Dear Father in Heaven,

1746
01:36:09,297 --> 01:36:11,197
I'm not a praying man,

1747
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:15,301
but if you're up there
and you can hear me,

1748
01:36:16,971 --> 01:36:18,529
show me the way.

1749
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:21,338
I'm at the end of my rope. I...

1750
01:36:23,278 --> 01:36:25,246
Show me the way, O God.

1751
01:36:30,151 --> 01:36:33,354
Are you all right, George?
Want somebody to take you home?

1752
01:36:33,354 --> 01:36:33,786
Are you all right, George?
Want somebody to take you home?

1753
01:36:36,524 --> 01:36:38,856
Why you drink so much, my friend?

1754
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:42,327
Please go home, Mr. Bailey.
This is Christmas Eve.

1755
01:36:42,864 --> 01:36:45,332
Bailey? Which Bailey?

1756
01:36:45,967 --> 01:36:47,992
This is Mr. George Bailey.

1757
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:55,073
The next time you talk to my wife
like that, you'll get worse!

1758
01:36:55,176 --> 01:36:56,507
She cried for an hour!

1759
01:36:56,611 --> 01:36:59,739
It isn't enough she slaves teaching
your stupid kids how to read and write,

1760
01:36:59,848 --> 01:37:02,373
- and you have to bawl her out.
- You get out of here, Mr. Welch!

1761
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:03,950
Now, wait, I want to pay for my drink.

1762
01:37:04,052 --> 01:37:05,679
Never mind the money!
You get out of here quick!

1763
01:37:05,787 --> 01:37:08,722
- All right!
- You hit my best friend! Get out!

1764
01:37:14,095 --> 01:37:16,689
- You all right, George?
- Who was that?

1765
01:37:17,131 --> 01:37:20,191
He gone. No worry. He name is Welch.

1766
01:37:20,301 --> 01:37:23,065
- He no come into my place no more.
- Oh, Welch.

1767
01:37:23,171 --> 01:37:25,071
That's what I get for praying.

1768
01:37:25,173 --> 01:37:27,198
The last time he come in here.
You hear that, Nick?

1769
01:37:27,308 --> 01:37:28,400
Yes, you bet.

1770
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:31,910
Where's my insurance policy?
Oh, here it is.

1771
01:37:32,013 --> 01:37:33,708
Oh, no, please,
don't go this way, Mr. Bailey.

1772
01:37:33,815 --> 01:37:35,442
- I'm all right.
- No, no, you no feel so good.

1773
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:36,915
- Sit down and rest.
- I'm all right.

1774
01:37:37,018 --> 01:37:39,077
Please no go away, please!

1775
01:37:57,605 --> 01:37:59,903
What do you think you're doing?

1776
01:38:02,010 --> 01:38:05,844
Now look what you did.
My great-grandfather planted this tree!

1777
01:38:06,781 --> 01:38:08,749
Hey, you! Hey, you!

1778
01:38:09,517 --> 01:38:13,214
Come back here, you drunken fool!
Get this car out of here!

1779
01:38:21,195 --> 01:38:24,756
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Look where you're going.

1780
01:39:11,612 --> 01:39:12,704
Help!

1781
01:39:14,315 --> 01:39:16,977
Help! Help!

1782
01:39:20,521 --> 01:39:22,318
Help! Help!

1783
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:26,551
Help!

1784
01:39:29,497 --> 01:39:33,399
Help! Help! Help! Help!

1785
01:39:39,607 --> 01:39:40,908
Help! Help!

1786
01:39:40,908 --> 01:39:41,806
Help! Help!

1787
01:39:58,626 --> 01:40:00,924
I didn't have time
to get some stylish underwear.

1788
01:40:01,029 --> 01:40:03,759
Wife gave me this
on my last birthday.

1789
01:40:04,465 --> 01:40:06,194
I passed away in it.

1790
01:40:09,804 --> 01:40:12,671
Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too.

1791
01:40:15,877 --> 01:40:19,278
You should read the new book
Mark Twain's writing now.

1792
01:40:19,981 --> 01:40:21,846
How did you happen to fall in?

1793
01:40:21,949 --> 01:40:25,077
I didn't fall in.
I jumped in to save George.

1794
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:28,287
You what? To save me?

1795
01:40:28,556 --> 01:40:31,616
Well, I did, didn't I?
You didn't go through with it, did you?

1796
01:40:31,726 --> 01:40:33,819
- Go through with what?
- Suicide.

1797
01:40:33,928 --> 01:40:36,988
It's against the law
to commit suicide around here.

1798
01:40:37,098 --> 01:40:39,896
Yeah, it's against the law
where I come from, too.

1799
01:40:40,001 --> 01:40:42,333
- Where do you come from?
- Heaven.

1800
01:40:47,508 --> 01:40:50,500
I had to act quickly.
That's why I jumped in.

1801
01:40:50,611 --> 01:40:53,011
I knew if I were drowning,
you'd try to save me.

1802
01:40:53,114 --> 01:40:56,015
You see, you did,
and that's how I saved you.

1803
01:40:56,784 --> 01:40:58,149
Very funny.

1804
01:40:58,419 --> 01:41:00,444
Your lip's bleeding, George.

1805
01:41:00,555 --> 01:41:04,651
Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw
in answer to a prayer a little bit ago.

1806
01:41:04,759 --> 01:41:08,559
Oh, no, no, no, George,
I'm the answer to your prayer.

1807
01:41:08,663 --> 01:41:10,961
That's why I was sent down here.

1808
01:41:11,566 --> 01:41:14,729
- How'd you know my name?
- Oh, I know all about you.

1809
01:41:14,836 --> 01:41:16,633
I've watched you grow up
from a little boy.

1810
01:41:16,737 --> 01:41:18,170
What are you,
a mind reader or something?

1811
01:41:18,272 --> 01:41:19,364
No.

1812
01:41:19,474 --> 01:41:23,376
- Well, who are you then?
- Clarence Oddbody, AS2.

1813
01:41:24,112 --> 01:41:25,374
Oddbody?

1814
01:41:26,481 --> 01:41:28,574
AS2? What's that, AS2?

1815
01:41:28,850 --> 01:41:30,545
Angel Second Class.

1816
01:41:40,995 --> 01:41:42,758
Cheerio, my good man.

1817
01:41:46,934 --> 01:41:48,333
Oh, brother.

1818
01:41:50,671 --> 01:41:51,899
Gee whiz.

1819
01:41:52,974 --> 01:41:55,738
I wonder what Martini
put in those drinks.

1820
01:41:57,845 --> 01:42:02,339
Hey, what's with you?
What did you say just a minute ago?

1821
01:42:02,683 --> 01:42:04,275
Why'd you want to save me?

1822
01:42:04,385 --> 01:42:07,946
That's what I was sent down for.
I'm your guardian angel.

1823
01:42:08,389 --> 01:42:10,482
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

1824
01:42:10,591 --> 01:42:14,925
Ridiculous of you to think
of killing yourself for money, $8,000.

1825
01:42:15,029 --> 01:42:18,055
Yeah, now, just things like that...
How do you know that?

1826
01:42:18,166 --> 01:42:22,159
I told you. I'm your guardian angel.
I know everything about you.

1827
01:42:23,204 --> 01:42:26,298
Well, you look about
like the kind of an angel I'd get.

1828
01:42:26,407 --> 01:42:29,342
Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you?
What happened to your wings?

1829
01:42:29,443 --> 01:42:33,436
I haven't won my wings yet.
That's why I'm an Angel Second Class.

1830
01:42:37,785 --> 01:42:39,309
I don't know whether I'd like it very much

1831
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:41,354
being seen around
with an angel without any wings.

1832
01:42:41,455 --> 01:42:45,050
Oh, I've got to earn them,
and you'll help me, won't you?

1833
01:42:45,159 --> 01:42:46,524
Sure, sure.

1834
01:42:47,061 --> 01:42:49,655
- How?
- By letting me help you.

1835
01:42:49,897 --> 01:42:52,661
Yes. Only one way you can help me.

1836
01:42:52,767 --> 01:42:54,701
You don't happen to have
8,000 bucks on you, do you?

1837
01:42:54,802 --> 01:42:57,236
Oh, no. No.
We don't use money in heaven.

1838
01:42:57,338 --> 01:42:59,863
Oh, yeah, that's right, I keep forgetting.

1839
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:04,203
- Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
- Oh, tut, tut, tut.

1840
01:43:05,279 --> 01:43:07,474
I found it out a little late.

1841
01:43:07,915 --> 01:43:09,940
I'm worth more dead than alive.

1842
01:43:10,051 --> 01:43:14,181
Now, look, you mustn't talk like that.
I won't get my wings with that attitude.

1843
01:43:14,288 --> 01:43:17,985
You just don't know all that you've done.
If it hadn't been for you...

1844
01:43:18,092 --> 01:43:20,754
Yeah, if it hadn't been for me,
everybody'd be a lot better off.

1845
01:43:20,861 --> 01:43:23,056
My wife and my kids and my friends.

1846
01:43:23,164 --> 01:43:26,395
I mean, look, little fellow, go off
and haunt somebody else, will you?

1847
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:29,128
No, now, you don't understand.
I've got my job...

1848
01:43:29,237 --> 01:43:31,068
Oh, shut up, will you?

1849
01:43:34,976 --> 01:43:37,638
Oh, this isn't gonna be so easy.

1850
01:43:42,984 --> 01:43:47,421
Yeah, so you still think killing yourself
would make everyone feel happier, eh?

1851
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:51,653
Well, I don't know. I guess you're right.

1852
01:43:52,994 --> 01:43:55,861
I suppose it would have been better
if I'd never been born at all.

1853
01:43:55,963 --> 01:43:59,262
- What'd you say?
- I said I wish I'd never been born.

1854
01:43:59,367 --> 01:44:01,961
Oh, you mustn't say things like that.

1855
01:44:02,436 --> 01:44:06,998
You... Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
That's an idea.

1856
01:44:08,009 --> 01:44:09,636
What do you think?

1857
01:44:10,311 --> 01:44:12,040
Yeah, that'll do it.

1858
01:44:12,747 --> 01:44:14,044
All right.

1859
01:44:16,784 --> 01:44:19,981
You've got your wish.
You've never been born.

1860
01:44:25,593 --> 01:44:28,585
You don't have
to make all that fuss about it!

1861
01:44:29,530 --> 01:44:30,929
What did you say?

1862
01:44:31,032 --> 01:44:34,866
You've never been born. You don't exist.
You haven't a care in the world.

1863
01:44:34,969 --> 01:44:38,234
No worries, no obligations,
no $8,000 to get,

1864
01:44:38,339 --> 01:44:40,170
no Potter looking for you
with the Sheriff.

1865
01:44:40,274 --> 01:44:43,710
- Say something else in that ear.
- Sure, you can hear out of it.

1866
01:44:43,811 --> 01:44:45,938
Well, that's the doggonedest thing.

1867
01:44:46,047 --> 01:44:48,572
I haven't heard anything out of that ear
since I was a kid.

1868
01:44:48,683 --> 01:44:50,810
Must have been that jump
in that cold water.

1869
01:44:50,918 --> 01:44:53,614
Your lip stopped bleeding, too, George.

1870
01:44:58,359 --> 01:45:02,022
What do you know about that?
What's happening?

1871
01:45:03,531 --> 01:45:05,795
It stopped snowing out here, didn't it?

1872
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:07,663
What's happened here?

1873
01:45:08,402 --> 01:45:10,302
What I need
is a couple of good stiff drinks.

1874
01:45:10,404 --> 01:45:12,668
How about you, Angel?
You want a drink?

1875
01:45:14,175 --> 01:45:16,439
Come on,
soon as these clothes of ours are dry...

1876
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:18,478
The clothes are dry.

1877
01:45:18,579 --> 01:45:21,707
What do you know about that?
Stove's hotter than I thought.

1878
01:45:21,816 --> 01:45:25,912
Now, come on, get your clothes on.
We'll stroll up to my car and get...

1879
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:28,181
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll. You fly.

1880
01:45:28,289 --> 01:45:29,813
I can't fly. I haven't got my wings.

1881
01:45:29,924 --> 01:45:32,586
You haven't got your wings.
Yeah, that's right.

1882
01:45:38,265 --> 01:45:39,596
What's the matter?

1883
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:42,396
Well, this is where I left my car,
and it isn't here.

1884
01:45:42,503 --> 01:45:45,802
- You have no car.
- Well, I had a car, and it was right here.

1885
01:45:45,906 --> 01:45:47,396
I guess somebody moved it.

1886
01:45:47,508 --> 01:45:51,569
- Good evening.
- Oh, say, hey, where's my car?

1887
01:45:51,846 --> 01:45:53,939
- I beg your pardon?
- My car, my car.

1888
01:45:54,048 --> 01:45:56,312
I'm the fellow that owns the car
that ran into your tree.

1889
01:45:56,417 --> 01:45:58,408
- What tree?
- What do you mean, what tree?

1890
01:45:58,519 --> 01:46:00,578
This tree. Here, I ran into it.

1891
01:46:00,688 --> 01:46:03,885
Cut a big gash in the side of it there.

1892
01:46:08,229 --> 01:46:11,687
You must mean two other trees.
You had me worried.

1893
01:46:11,799 --> 01:46:13,994
One of the oldest trees in Pottersville.

1894
01:46:14,101 --> 01:46:15,227
Pottersville?

1895
01:46:15,336 --> 01:46:16,928
Why, you mean Bedford Falls.

1896
01:46:17,037 --> 01:46:20,564
I mean Pottersville.
Don't you think I know where I live?

1897
01:46:20,775 --> 01:46:22,834
What's the matter with you?

1898
01:46:22,943 --> 01:46:26,106
What's the matter with me?
Well, I guess I just...

1899
01:46:28,716 --> 01:46:32,982
Oh, I don't know.
Either I'm off my nut or he is or you are.

1900
01:46:34,021 --> 01:46:35,352
It isn't me.

1901
01:46:35,456 --> 01:46:37,447
Well, maybe I left the car
up at Martini's.

1902
01:46:37,558 --> 01:46:39,890
- Well, come on, Gabriel.
- Clarence.

1903
01:46:39,994 --> 01:46:41,723
Clarence. Clarence.

1904
01:46:47,234 --> 01:46:51,034
That's all right. Go on in.
Martini is a friend of mine.

1905
01:46:51,439 --> 01:46:54,067
There's a place to sit down. Sit down.

1906
01:47:00,448 --> 01:47:03,975
- Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini?
- Want a martini?

1907
01:47:04,084 --> 01:47:06,109
No, no, Martini. Your boss.
Where is he?

1908
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:08,620
Hey, look, I'm the boss.
You want a drink or don't you?

1909
01:47:08,722 --> 01:47:10,917
Okay, all right. Double bourbon,
will you, and quick, huh?

1910
01:47:11,025 --> 01:47:12,219
Okay.

1911
01:47:15,396 --> 01:47:18,422
- What's yours?
- I was just thinking.

1912
01:47:19,667 --> 01:47:22,067
It's been so long since I...

1913
01:47:22,169 --> 01:47:25,798
Look, mister, I'm standing here
waiting for you to make up your mind.

1914
01:47:25,906 --> 01:47:27,498
That's a good man.

1915
01:47:27,608 --> 01:47:29,735
I was just thinking

1916
01:47:30,644 --> 01:47:33,772
of a flaming rum punch.

1917
01:47:34,181 --> 01:47:36,672
No, it's not cold enough for that,
not nearly cold enough.

1918
01:47:36,784 --> 01:47:39,719
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I got it.

1919
01:47:39,820 --> 01:47:43,415
Mulled wine, heavy on the cinnamon
and light on the cloves.

1920
01:47:43,524 --> 01:47:45,424
Off with you, me lad, and be lively!

1921
01:47:45,526 --> 01:47:48,518
Hey, look, mister,
we serve hard drinks in here

1922
01:47:48,629 --> 01:47:50,392
for men who want to get drunk fast.

1923
01:47:50,498 --> 01:47:54,025
And we don't need any characters
around to give the joint atmosphere.

1924
01:47:54,134 --> 01:47:57,729
Is that clear, or do I have
to slip you my left for a convincer?

1925
01:47:57,838 --> 01:47:59,203
What's he talking about?

1926
01:47:59,306 --> 01:48:03,174
Nick, Nick,
just give him the same as mine.

1927
01:48:03,277 --> 01:48:05,575
- He's okay.
- Okay.

1928
01:48:07,047 --> 01:48:10,608
What's the matter with him?
I never saw Nick act like that before.

1929
01:48:10,718 --> 01:48:13,778
You'll see a lot of strange things
from now on.

1930
01:48:14,088 --> 01:48:15,817
Oh, yeah.

1931
01:48:19,059 --> 01:48:22,654
Hey, little fellow,
you worry me, you know.

1932
01:48:22,763 --> 01:48:25,698
- You got someplace to sleep?
- No.

1933
01:48:25,799 --> 01:48:27,323
You don't, huh?

1934
01:48:27,434 --> 01:48:30,028
- Well, you got any money?
- No.

1935
01:48:31,005 --> 01:48:32,632
No wonder you jumped in the river.

1936
01:48:32,740 --> 01:48:36,335
I jumped in the river to save you
so I could get my wings.

1937
01:48:40,247 --> 01:48:42,340
- Somebody's just made it.
- Made what?

1938
01:48:42,449 --> 01:48:47,216
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means
that some angel's just got his wings.

1939
01:48:55,129 --> 01:48:57,859
Look, I think maybe you
better not mention

1940
01:48:57,965 --> 01:48:59,296
getting your wings around here.

1941
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:01,800
Why? Don't they believe in angels?

1942
01:49:04,405 --> 01:49:06,236
Yeah, they believe in them.

1943
01:49:06,340 --> 01:49:09,605
Oh, why should they be surprised
when they see one?

1944
01:49:11,445 --> 01:49:14,642
Oh, he never grew up. He's...

1945
01:49:15,082 --> 01:49:19,075
- How old are you anyway, Clarence?
- Two hundred and ninety-three,

1946
01:49:21,322 --> 01:49:22,550
next May.

1947
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:25,784
That does it. Out, you two pixies!

1948
01:49:25,893 --> 01:49:27,861
Go through the door or out the window.

1949
01:49:27,962 --> 01:49:29,987
- Look, Nick, what's wrong?
- Now, that's another thing.

1950
01:49:30,097 --> 01:49:32,065
Where do you come off
calling me Nick?

1951
01:49:32,166 --> 01:49:33,633
Well, Nick, that's your name.

1952
01:49:33,734 --> 01:49:37,864
What's that got to do with it?
I don't know you from Adam's off ox.

1953
01:49:37,972 --> 01:49:40,805
Hey. Hey, you rummy, there.
Come here, come here.

1954
01:49:44,311 --> 01:49:47,838
Didn't I tell you never to come
panhandling around here, huh?

1955
01:49:54,955 --> 01:49:56,286
Mr. Gower.

1956
01:49:57,558 --> 01:49:58,855
Mr. Gower.

1957
01:50:00,527 --> 01:50:02,222
What... What did...

1958
01:50:02,630 --> 01:50:05,030
Mr. Gower, look, this is George Bailey.

1959
01:50:06,433 --> 01:50:08,526
- Don't you know me?
- No.

1960
01:50:10,170 --> 01:50:11,330
No.

1961
01:50:11,438 --> 01:50:12,871
Throw him out. Throw him out.

1962
01:50:12,973 --> 01:50:14,964
Mr. Gower! Hey, what is...

1963
01:50:16,143 --> 01:50:18,407
Hey, Nick. Nick.
Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist?

1964
01:50:18,512 --> 01:50:20,707
You know, that's another reason
for me not to like you.

1965
01:50:20,814 --> 01:50:24,250
That rum head spent 20 years in jail
for poisoning a kid.

1966
01:50:24,351 --> 01:50:27,184
If you know him,
you must be a jailbird yourself.

1967
01:50:27,287 --> 01:50:29,312
Would you show these gentlemen
to the door?

1968
01:50:29,423 --> 01:50:31,414
Sure. This way, gentlemen.

1969
01:50:36,897 --> 01:50:38,159
Stay out.

1970
01:50:39,333 --> 01:50:41,893
Get me! I'm giving out wings!

1971
01:50:44,605 --> 01:50:47,096
You see, George,
you were not there to stop Gower

1972
01:50:47,207 --> 01:50:48,868
from putting that poison
into the capsules.

1973
01:50:48,976 --> 01:50:52,605
What do you mean, I wasn't there?
I remember distinctly...

1974
01:50:54,848 --> 01:50:57,248
Hey, what's going on around here?

1975
01:50:57,551 --> 01:50:58,882
What...

1976
01:51:00,054 --> 01:51:02,648
Why, this ought to be Martini's place.

1977
01:51:08,595 --> 01:51:10,222
Look, who are you?

1978
01:51:10,497 --> 01:51:13,022
I told you, George.
I'm your guardian angel.

1979
01:51:13,133 --> 01:51:15,328
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that.

1980
01:51:20,974 --> 01:51:24,205
What else are you?
What, are you a hypnotist?

1981
01:51:24,311 --> 01:51:25,437
No. Of course not.

1982
01:51:25,546 --> 01:51:28,106
Well, then, why am I seeing
all these strange things here?

1983
01:51:28,215 --> 01:51:32,618
Don't you understand, George?
It's because you were not born.

1984
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:37,020
- Well, if I wasn't born, who am I?
- You're nobody. You have no identity.

1985
01:51:37,124 --> 01:51:39,752
What do you mean, no identity?
My name's George Bailey.

1986
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:41,885
There is no George Bailey.

1987
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:47,330
You have no papers, no cards,
no driver's license,

1988
01:51:47,801 --> 01:51:50,497
no 4-F card, no insurance policy.

1989
01:51:51,538 --> 01:51:53,529
They're not there, either.

1990
01:51:54,808 --> 01:51:57,106
- What?
- Zuzu's petals.

1991
01:52:02,616 --> 01:52:05,312
You've been given a great gift, George,

1992
01:52:05,519 --> 01:52:09,080
a chance to see what the world
would be like without you.

1993
01:52:11,458 --> 01:52:14,052
Now, wait a minute here.
Wait a minute here.

1994
01:52:15,996 --> 01:52:19,261
This is some sort of a funny dream
I'm having.

1995
01:52:19,466 --> 01:52:21,263
So long, mister. I'm going home.

1996
01:52:21,368 --> 01:52:24,201
- Home? What home?
- Shut up! Cut it out!

1997
01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:28,731
You're crazy!
That's what I think. You're screwy.

1998
01:52:29,209 --> 01:52:31,871
You're driving me crazy, too.
I'm seeing things here.

1999
01:52:31,979 --> 01:52:33,879
I'm going home
and see my wife and family.

2000
01:52:33,981 --> 01:52:37,144
You understand that?
And I'm going home alone.

2001
01:52:39,553 --> 01:52:41,418
How am I doing, Joseph?

2002
01:52:42,189 --> 01:52:43,349
Thanks.

2003
01:52:43,724 --> 01:52:45,749
No, I didn't have a drink.

2004
01:53:37,010 --> 01:53:39,535
Hey, hey, where did
the Building and Loan move to?

2005
01:53:39,646 --> 01:53:40,635
Building and what?

2006
01:53:40,747 --> 01:53:42,476
The Bailey Building and Loan.
It was up there.

2007
01:53:42,583 --> 01:53:44,414
They went out of business years ago.

2008
01:53:44,518 --> 01:53:45,883
That sailor's a liar!

2009
01:53:45,986 --> 01:53:48,250
I know every big shot in this town!

2010
01:53:48,355 --> 01:53:50,880
I know Potter,
and I'll have you kicked off the beat.

2011
01:53:50,991 --> 01:53:52,424
Hey, Violet!

2012
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:56,220
Hey, hey! Listen. That's Violet Bick.

2013
01:53:56,330 --> 01:53:58,423
- I know.
- I know that girl!

2014
01:53:58,532 --> 01:54:00,295
Take a walk. Beat it.

2015
01:54:02,336 --> 01:54:04,065
Hey, Ernie! Ernie.

2016
01:54:06,273 --> 01:54:08,138
Ernie, take me home.
I'm going off my nut.

2017
01:54:08,242 --> 01:54:09,231
Where do you live?

2018
01:54:09,343 --> 01:54:11,402
Now, doggone it, Ernie,
don't you start pulling that stuff.

2019
01:54:11,511 --> 01:54:14,002
You know where I live. 320 Sycamore.
Now hurry up.

2020
01:54:14,114 --> 01:54:17,550
- All right. 320 Sycamore?
- Yeah, yeah, hurry up. Zuzu's sick.

2021
01:54:17,651 --> 01:54:19,448
- Come on.
- All right. All right.

2022
01:54:20,087 --> 01:54:22,112
Come on, Ernie,
now straighten me out here.

2023
01:54:22,222 --> 01:54:25,214
Look, I've got some bad liquor
or something. Listen to me.

2024
01:54:25,325 --> 01:54:26,485
Now, you are Ernie Bishop,

2025
01:54:26,593 --> 01:54:28,322
and you live in Bailey Park
with your wife and kid?

2026
01:54:28,428 --> 01:54:30,453
- That's right, isn't it?
- You seen my wife?

2027
01:54:30,564 --> 01:54:33,795
Seen your wife?
I've been to your house 100 times.

2028
01:54:33,901 --> 01:54:36,699
Look, bud, what's the idea?
I live in a shack in Potter's Field,

2029
01:54:36,803 --> 01:54:38,794
my wife ran away three years ago
and took the kid,

2030
01:54:38,906 --> 01:54:41,374
and I ain't never seen you
before in my life, see?

2031
01:54:41,475 --> 01:54:44,205
Okay, well, just step on it.
Just get me home!

2032
01:55:01,762 --> 01:55:04,026
- Is this the place?
- Of course it's the place.

2033
01:55:04,131 --> 01:55:07,328
Well, this house ain't been lived in
for 20 years.

2034
01:55:13,407 --> 01:55:15,375
- What's up, Ernie?
- I don't know.

2035
01:55:15,475 --> 01:55:18,638
But we better keep our eye on this guy.
He's bats.

2036
01:55:36,129 --> 01:55:38,290
Mary. Mary!

2037
01:55:41,301 --> 01:55:44,168
Tommy! Pete! Janie! Zuzu!
Where are you?

2038
01:55:44,638 --> 01:55:47,232
They're not here, George.
You have no children.

2039
01:55:47,341 --> 01:55:48,774
Where are they?
What have you done with them?

2040
01:55:48,875 --> 01:55:51,002
All right, put up your hands.
No fast moves.

2041
01:55:51,111 --> 01:55:52,669
Come on out here, both of you.

2042
01:55:52,779 --> 01:55:55,077
- Bert! Thank heaven you're here.
- Back this.

2043
01:55:55,182 --> 01:55:58,447
Bert, what's happened to this house?
Where's Mary? Where's my kids?

2044
01:55:58,552 --> 01:56:00,179
- Watch him, Bert.
- Come on, come on.

2045
01:56:00,287 --> 01:56:02,312
Bert, Ernie.
What's the matter with you two guys?

2046
01:56:02,422 --> 01:56:03,889
You were here on my wedding night.

2047
01:56:03,991 --> 01:56:05,583
You, both of you,
stood out there on the porch

2048
01:56:05,692 --> 01:56:07,990
- and sung to us, don't you remember?
- Think I'd better be going.

2049
01:56:08,095 --> 01:56:09,392
Look, now, why don't you be a good kid,

2050
01:56:09,496 --> 01:56:10,622
and we'll take you in to a doctor?

2051
01:56:10,731 --> 01:56:12,665
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- Bert, no, listen to me.

2052
01:56:12,766 --> 01:56:14,597
Ernie, will you take me over
to my mother's house?

2053
01:56:14,701 --> 01:56:17,169
Bert, listen. It's that fellow here.
He says he's an angel.

2054
01:56:17,270 --> 01:56:20,671
- He's trying to hypnotize me.
- I hate to do this to you, bud, but...

2055
01:56:22,042 --> 01:56:24,738
Run, George! Run, George! Run!

2056
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:29,244
- Joseph! Help! Help!
- Oh, shut up.

2057
01:56:29,416 --> 01:56:32,180
Oh, Joseph! Joseph!

2058
01:56:38,025 --> 01:56:40,660
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?
I had him right here.

2059
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:41,285
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?
I had him right here.

2060
01:56:44,064 --> 01:56:45,588
I need a drink.

2061
01:56:46,099 --> 01:56:48,693
Well, which way did he go?
Help me find him.

2062
01:56:58,645 --> 01:56:59,737
Well?

2063
01:57:03,016 --> 01:57:04,176
Mother.

2064
01:57:06,219 --> 01:57:08,210
Mother? What do you want?

2065
01:57:09,456 --> 01:57:12,050
Mother, this is George.

2066
01:57:12,459 --> 01:57:14,222
I thought sure you'd remember me.

2067
01:57:14,327 --> 01:57:15,726
George who?

2068
01:57:15,829 --> 01:57:17,660
If you're looking for a room,
there's no vacancy.

2069
01:57:17,764 --> 01:57:21,097
Mother, listen. Please help me.
Something terrible's happened to me.

2070
01:57:21,201 --> 01:57:23,601
I don't know what it is.
Something's happened to everybody.

2071
01:57:23,703 --> 01:57:26,638
Please let me come in,
and keep me here until I get over it.

2072
01:57:26,740 --> 01:57:29,072
Get over what? I don't take in strangers

2073
01:57:29,176 --> 01:57:31,667
unless they're sent here
by somebody I know.

2074
01:57:32,045 --> 01:57:37,005
Well, I know everybody you know.
Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.

2075
01:57:37,117 --> 01:57:38,812
- You know him?
- Well, sure I do.

2076
01:57:38,919 --> 01:57:41,046
- When did you see him last?
- Today over at his house.

2077
01:57:41,154 --> 01:57:42,246
It's a lie.

2078
01:57:42,355 --> 01:57:45,222
He's been in the insane asylum
ever since he lost his business.

2079
01:57:45,325 --> 01:57:48,158
And if you ask me,
that's where you belong.

2080
01:58:00,107 --> 01:58:01,734
Strange, isn't it?

2081
01:58:02,242 --> 01:58:05,143
Each man's life
touches so many other lives.

2082
01:58:05,612 --> 01:58:08,547
And when he isn't around,
he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?

2083
01:58:08,648 --> 01:58:09,808
I've heard of things like this.

2084
01:58:09,916 --> 01:58:11,645
You got me in some kind of a spell
or something.

2085
01:58:11,751 --> 01:58:13,810
Well, I'm gonna get out of it.
I'll get out of it.

2086
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:15,683
I know how, too. I...

2087
01:58:16,123 --> 01:58:17,249
The last man I talked to,

2088
01:58:17,357 --> 01:58:19,484
before all this stuff
started happening to me, was Martini.

2089
01:58:19,593 --> 01:58:20,787
You know where he lives?

2090
01:58:20,894 --> 01:58:23,761
Well, sure, I know where he lives.
He lives in Bailey Park.

2091
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:31,837
- Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
- No, I'm not sure of anything anymore.

2092
01:58:32,739 --> 01:58:35,537
All I know is this should be Bailey Park.

2093
01:58:36,376 --> 01:58:40,073
- But where are the houses?
- You weren't here to build them.

2094
01:58:44,684 --> 01:58:47,676
Your brother Harry Bailey
broke through the ice

2095
01:58:47,787 --> 01:58:49,652
and was drowned at the age of nine.

2096
01:58:49,756 --> 01:58:51,815
That's a lie. Harry Bailey went to war.

2097
01:58:51,925 --> 01:58:53,358
He got the Congressional
Medal of Honor.

2098
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:55,394
He saved the lives
of every man on that transport.

2099
01:58:55,495 --> 01:58:57,520
Every man on that transport died.

2100
01:58:57,631 --> 01:58:58,928
Harry wasn't there to save them,

2101
01:58:59,032 --> 01:59:01,728
because you weren't there
to save Harry.

2102
01:59:12,946 --> 01:59:16,438
You see, George?
You really had a wonderful life.

2103
01:59:16,950 --> 01:59:20,977
Don't you see what a mistake
it would be to throw it away?

2104
01:59:21,688 --> 01:59:23,588
- Clarence.
- Yes, George?

2105
01:59:24,624 --> 01:59:27,821
- Where's Mary?
- Oh, well, I can't...

2106
01:59:27,928 --> 01:59:30,419
I don't know how you know these things,
but tell me, where is she?

2107
01:59:30,530 --> 01:59:32,498
If you know where she is,
tell me where my wife is.

2108
01:59:32,599 --> 01:59:35,568
- I'm not supposed to tell.
- Please, Clarence, tell me where she is.

2109
01:59:35,669 --> 01:59:37,967
- You're not gonna like it, George.
- Where is she?

2110
01:59:38,071 --> 01:59:40,403
She's an old maid. She never married.

2111
01:59:40,507 --> 01:59:42,839
Where is Mary? Where is she?
Where is she?

2112
01:59:42,943 --> 01:59:45,810
She's just about to close up the library!

2113
01:59:49,716 --> 01:59:53,083
There must be some easier way
for me to get my wings.

2114
02:00:04,631 --> 02:00:05,689
Mary!

2115
02:00:11,371 --> 02:00:12,429
Mary!

2116
02:00:14,874 --> 02:00:15,966
Mary!

2117
02:00:17,410 --> 02:00:18,900
Mary! Mary!

2118
02:00:19,145 --> 02:00:21,841
Mary, it's George. Don't you know me?
What's happened to us?

2119
02:00:21,948 --> 02:00:23,279
I don't know you. Let me go!

2120
02:00:23,383 --> 02:00:26,409
Mary, please! Oh, don't do this to me.
Please, Mary, help me.

2121
02:00:26,519 --> 02:00:28,646
Where's our kids? I need you, Mary.

2122
02:00:29,356 --> 02:00:31,085
Help me, Mary!

2123
02:00:31,391 --> 02:00:32,983
Mary! Let me go!

2124
02:00:33,293 --> 02:00:34,988
Help! It's a wild man!

2125
02:00:36,263 --> 02:00:38,925
The wild man is chasing me.
Somebody stop him!

2126
02:00:39,032 --> 02:00:41,557
Tom! Ed! Charlie!

2127
02:00:42,302 --> 02:00:43,633
That's my wife!

2128
02:00:46,206 --> 02:00:47,696
- Mary!
- No, you don't.

2129
02:00:47,807 --> 02:00:48,899
Somebody call the police.

2130
02:00:49,009 --> 02:00:50,306
Somebody hit him on the head
with a bottle.

2131
02:00:50,410 --> 02:00:52,503
You need a straightjacket.

2132
02:00:53,647 --> 02:00:54,909
Clarence!

2133
02:00:55,415 --> 02:00:56,973
Get out of here!

2134
02:00:57,083 --> 02:00:58,311
Clarence!

2135
02:01:00,053 --> 02:01:02,487
- Clarence!
- Right, that's you!

2136
02:01:05,625 --> 02:01:06,956
Stand back!

2137
02:01:10,730 --> 02:01:11,992
Clarence!

2138
02:01:21,174 --> 02:01:22,436
Clarence!

2139
02:01:27,414 --> 02:01:29,609
Clarence! Clarence!

2140
02:01:31,284 --> 02:01:32,945
Help me, Clarence!

2141
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:35,485
Get me back!

2142
02:01:36,389 --> 02:01:39,290
Get me back.
I don't care what happens to me.

2143
02:01:39,693 --> 02:01:42,025
Get me back to my wife and kids.

2144
02:01:42,228 --> 02:01:44,253
Help me, Clarence, please.

2145
02:01:44,798 --> 02:01:49,394
Please. I want to live again.
I want to live again.

2146
02:01:51,171 --> 02:01:55,130
I want to live again.
Please, God, let me live again.

2147
02:02:04,217 --> 02:02:05,616
Hey, George!

2148
02:02:07,053 --> 02:02:08,213
George!

2149
02:02:09,289 --> 02:02:11,280
You all right. Hey, what's the matter?

2150
02:02:11,391 --> 02:02:13,825
Now get out of here, Bert,
or I'll hit you again! Get out of here!

2151
02:02:13,927 --> 02:02:15,622
What the sam hill
are you yelling for, George?

2152
02:02:15,729 --> 02:02:17,196
You...

2153
02:02:18,565 --> 02:02:21,432
George? Bert, do you know me?

2154
02:02:21,801 --> 02:02:23,769
Know you? You kidding?

2155
02:02:23,870 --> 02:02:25,997
I've been looking all over town
trying to find you.

2156
02:02:26,106 --> 02:02:29,041
I saw your car piled into that tree
down there, and I thought maybe you...

2157
02:02:29,142 --> 02:02:31,372
Hey, your mouth's bleeding.
Are you sure you're all right?

2158
02:02:31,478 --> 02:02:32,945
What did...

2159
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:39,978
My mouth's bleeding, Bert!
My mouth's...

2160
02:02:40,286 --> 02:02:43,312
Zuzu's petals. Zuzu... There they are!

2161
02:02:43,423 --> 02:02:46,324
Bert! What do you know about that?

2162
02:02:46,426 --> 02:02:50,157
- Merry Christmas!
- Well, Merry Christmas.

2163
02:02:50,630 --> 02:02:53,690
Mary! Mary!

2164
02:03:02,375 --> 02:03:04,343
Hello, Bedford Falls!

2165
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:08,745
Merry Christmas!

2166
02:03:08,848 --> 02:03:10,645
- Merry Christmas, George!
- Merry Christmas!

2167
02:03:10,750 --> 02:03:12,615
Merry Christmas, George.

2168
02:03:12,719 --> 02:03:15,085
Merry Christmas, movie house!

2169
02:03:15,688 --> 02:03:17,952
Merry Christmas, emporium!

2170
02:03:19,225 --> 02:03:22,888
Merry Christmas,
you wonderful old Building and Loan!

2171
02:03:27,133 --> 02:03:30,694
Hey, Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!

2172
02:03:30,804 --> 02:03:33,500
Happy New Year to you in jail!

2173
02:03:33,606 --> 02:03:35,631
Go on home. They're waiting for you.

2174
02:03:37,243 --> 02:03:40,212
Mary! Mary!

2175
02:03:41,948 --> 02:03:43,006
Mary!

2176
02:03:43,950 --> 02:03:46,783
Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner!
How are you?

2177
02:03:46,886 --> 02:03:49,081
- Mr. Bailey, there's a deficit.
- I know, $8,000.

2178
02:03:49,189 --> 02:03:50,622
George, I've got a little paper here.

2179
02:03:50,723 --> 02:03:51,985
I'll bet it's a warrant for my arrest.

2180
02:03:52,091 --> 02:03:53,718
Isn't it wonderful? I'm going to jail!

2181
02:03:53,827 --> 02:03:56,193
Merry Christmas! Reporters?
Where's Mary?

2182
02:03:56,296 --> 02:03:59,094
Mary! Oh, look at this wonderful,
old drafty house.

2183
02:03:59,199 --> 02:04:01,429
Mary! Mary!

2184
02:04:02,735 --> 02:04:03,793
Mary.

2185
02:04:04,604 --> 02:04:06,231
Have you seen my wife?

2186
02:04:06,339 --> 02:04:09,206
Merry Christmas, Daddy.

2187
02:04:09,309 --> 02:04:11,300
Kids! Pete!

2188
02:04:16,015 --> 02:04:17,277
Kids! Janie!

2189
02:04:17,383 --> 02:04:18,850
Janie! Tommy!

2190
02:04:20,987 --> 02:04:23,820
Let me look at you.
Oh, I could eat you up.

2191
02:04:24,624 --> 02:04:25,682
Where's your mother?

2192
02:04:25,792 --> 02:04:27,555
- She went looking for you.
- With Uncle Billy.

2193
02:04:27,660 --> 02:04:29,355
- Daddy!
- Zuzu!

2194
02:04:29,462 --> 02:04:31,987
Zuzu, my little gingersnap.
How do you feel?

2195
02:04:32,098 --> 02:04:35,363
- Fine! Not a smidge of temperature.
- Not a smidge of...

2196
02:04:36,069 --> 02:04:38,003
- Hallelujah!
- Hello.

2197
02:04:38,771 --> 02:04:41,641
- George! George, darling!
- Mary! Mary!

2198
02:04:41,641 --> 02:04:41,902
- George! George, darling!
- Mary! Mary!

2199
02:04:42,008 --> 02:04:44,203
George, darling. Where have you been?

2200
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:47,609
- Oh, George, George, George.
- Mary.

2201
02:04:47,714 --> 02:04:50,911
Let me touch you.
Let me touch you. Are you real?

2202
02:04:52,418 --> 02:04:54,511
George, George.

2203
02:04:54,621 --> 02:04:56,521
You have no idea
what's happened to me.

2204
02:04:56,623 --> 02:04:58,591
You've no idea what happened...

2205
02:04:59,492 --> 02:05:01,585
Well, come on, George.
Come on downstairs, quick.

2206
02:05:01,694 --> 02:05:03,025
- They're on their way.
- All right.

2207
02:05:03,129 --> 02:05:04,323
Come on.

2208
02:05:06,766 --> 02:05:08,495
Come on in here now.

2209
02:05:09,702 --> 02:05:11,329
Now, you stand right over here
by the tree.

2210
02:05:11,437 --> 02:05:13,667
Right there, and don't move.
Don't move.

2211
02:05:13,773 --> 02:05:15,297
What's happening?
Who's gonna come?

2212
02:05:15,742 --> 02:05:17,073
I hear them coming now.

2213
02:05:17,176 --> 02:05:19,576
George, it's a miracle. It's a miracle.

2214
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:21,874
- What's happening?
- What's happening?

2215
02:05:21,981 --> 02:05:23,949
- Who's gonna come, Daddy?
- Who, Daddy?

2216
02:05:24,050 --> 02:05:27,679
Come in, Uncle Billy.
Everybody, in here.

2217
02:05:27,787 --> 02:05:28,981
George.

2218
02:05:30,490 --> 02:05:32,685
Here's everything right here.

2219
02:05:34,027 --> 02:05:37,622
Isn't it wonderful? So many friends.
Mary did it, George! Mary did it!

2220
02:05:37,730 --> 02:05:39,288
She told some people
you were in trouble,

2221
02:05:39,399 --> 02:05:41,333
and they scattered all over town
collecting money.

2222
02:05:41,434 --> 02:05:42,526
Didn't ask any questions.

2223
02:05:42,635 --> 02:05:44,296
Just said,
"George in trouble? Then count me in."

2224
02:05:44,404 --> 02:05:46,099
- What is this...
- You never saw anything like it.

2225
02:05:46,205 --> 02:05:48,298
...another run on the bank?

2226
02:05:48,408 --> 02:05:50,876
Here you are, George. Merry Christmas.

2227
02:05:50,977 --> 02:05:52,945
Now, don't crowd. Don't push.
There we are.

2228
02:05:53,046 --> 02:05:55,173
The line forms on the right.

2229
02:05:55,548 --> 02:05:57,175
More coming, George.

2230
02:05:57,283 --> 02:05:59,774
Merry Christmas, and God bless you.

2231
02:06:00,853 --> 02:06:02,445
Merry Christmas.

2232
02:06:02,822 --> 02:06:05,188
- Oh, Mr. Martini!
- Merry Christmas.

2233
02:06:05,291 --> 02:06:07,759
Martini! Step right up here.

2234
02:06:08,528 --> 02:06:10,928
I busted the jukebox, too.

2235
02:06:14,133 --> 02:06:15,623
Oh, Mr. Gower!

2236
02:06:17,904 --> 02:06:20,600
I made the rounds
of my charge accounts.

2237
02:06:28,481 --> 02:06:31,541
I'm not gonna go, George.
I changed my mind.

2238
02:06:31,884 --> 02:06:33,283
Violet Bick.

2239
02:06:34,087 --> 02:06:35,748
Oh, Annie! Annie!

2240
02:06:36,990 --> 02:06:39,254
I've been saving this money
for a divorce,

2241
02:06:39,359 --> 02:06:41,327
if ever I get a husband.

2242
02:06:42,662 --> 02:06:43,788
Merry Christmas.

2243
02:06:46,032 --> 02:06:49,365
There you are, George.
I got the faculty all up and out of bed.

2244
02:06:49,469 --> 02:06:51,733
Here's something for you to play with.

2245
02:06:53,272 --> 02:06:56,400
I wouldn't have a roof over my head
if it wasn't for you, George.

2246
02:06:56,509 --> 02:07:00,001
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Quiet, everybody. Quiet, quiet.

2247
02:07:00,113 --> 02:07:02,274
Now, get this, it's from London.

2248
02:07:03,216 --> 02:07:05,776
"Mr. Gower cabled you need cash. Stop.

2249
02:07:06,019 --> 02:07:10,285
"My office instructed
to advance you up to $25,000. Stop.

2250
02:07:10,390 --> 02:07:13,382
"Hee-haw and Merry Christmas.
Sam Wainwright."

2251
02:07:23,636 --> 02:07:26,036
And Mr. Martini. How about some wine?

2252
02:07:32,045 --> 02:07:35,742
Hark the herald angels sing

2253
02:07:35,848 --> 02:07:40,114
Glory to the newborn king

2254
02:07:40,219 --> 02:07:44,553
Peace on earth and mercy mild

2255
02:07:44,657 --> 02:07:48,718
God and sinners reconciled

2256
02:07:48,828 --> 02:07:53,128
Joyful, all ye nations rise

2257
02:07:53,232 --> 02:07:57,293
Join the triumph of the skies

2258
02:07:57,403 --> 02:08:01,533
With angelic host proclaim

2259
02:08:01,641 --> 02:08:05,202
Christ is born in Bethlehem

2260
02:08:05,311 --> 02:08:06,778
Harry Bailey!

2261
02:08:12,285 --> 02:08:14,515
George, you old son of a gun.

2262
02:08:14,787 --> 02:08:17,017
Harry. Harry.

2263
02:08:17,290 --> 02:08:18,450
Looks like I got here too late.

2264
02:08:18,558 --> 02:08:21,152
Mary, I got him here from the airport
just as quick as I could.

2265
02:08:21,260 --> 02:08:23,023
The fool flew all the way up here
in a blizzard.

2266
02:08:23,129 --> 02:08:24,858
Harry, how about your banquet
in New York?

2267
02:08:24,964 --> 02:08:27,592
Oh, I left right in the middle of it
as soon as I got Mary's telegram.

2268
02:08:27,700 --> 02:08:29,668
Good idea, Ernie. A toast

2269
02:08:29,769 --> 02:08:33,034
to my big brother, George,
the richest man in town!

2270
02:08:35,208 --> 02:08:40,646
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

2271
02:08:40,747 --> 02:08:46,242
And never brought to mind?

2272
02:08:46,352 --> 02:08:47,979
Should auld acquaintance

2273
02:08:51,023 --> 02:08:52,047
Be forgot

2274
02:08:52,158 --> 02:08:56,561
And days of auld lang syne

2275
02:08:56,662 --> 02:08:58,061
Who's that?

2276
02:08:59,198 --> 02:09:02,759
That's a Christmas present
from a very dear friend of mine.

2277
02:09:03,603 --> 02:09:04,729
Look, Daddy!

2278
02:09:04,837 --> 02:09:10,207
Teacher says every time a bell rings,
an angel gets his wings.

2279
02:09:11,010 --> 02:09:12,477
That's right.

2280
02:09:13,045 --> 02:09:14,512
That's right.

2281
02:09:16,048 --> 02:09:17,174
Attaboy, Clarence.

2282
02:09:17,283 --> 02:09:19,911
Auld lang syne

2283
02:09:20,019 --> 02:09:25,389
