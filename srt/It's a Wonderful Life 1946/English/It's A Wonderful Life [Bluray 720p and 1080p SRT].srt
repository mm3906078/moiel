1
00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:30,937
I owe everything to George Bailey ... 
Help him, dear Father.

2
00:01:30,937 --> 00:01:37,088
Joseph, Jesus and Mary. 
Help my friend, Mr. Bailey.

3
00:01:37,088 --> 00:01:40,367
Help my son, George, tonight.

4
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:44,094
He never thinks about himself, 
God, that's why he's in trouble.

5
00:01:44,094 --> 00:01:48,630
George is a good guy. 
Give him a break, God ...

6
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,504
I love him, dear Lord. 
Watch over him tonight ...

7
00:01:52,504 --> 00:01:56,228
Please, God, something's 
the matter with Daddy ...

8
00:01:56,228 --> 00:02:00,798
Please bring Daddy back.

9
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,568
Hello, Joseph. 
Trouble?

10
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:14,281
Looks like we'll have to 
send someone down.

11
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:17,643
A lot of people asking for help 
for a man named  George Bailey.

12
00:02:17,643 --> 00:02:21,631
George Bailey. Yes. Tonight's 
his crucial night. You're right.

13
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:24,697
We'll have to send someone down 
immediately. Whose turn is it?

14
00:02:24,697 --> 00:02:27,404
That's why I came to see you, sir.

15
00:02:27,404 --> 00:02:29,684
It's that clock-maker's turn again.

16
00:02:29,684 --> 00:02:32,982
Oh, Clarence. 
Hasn't got his wings yet, has he?

17
00:02:32,982 --> 00:02:35,158
We've passed him up right along.

18
00:02:35,158 --> 00:02:38,438
Because, you know, sir, he's got 
the I.Q. of a rabbit.

19
00:02:38,438 --> 00:02:42,163
Yes, but he's got the faith 
of a child. Simple.

20
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:44,318
Joseph, send for Clarence.

21
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:48,782
You sent for me, sir?

22
00:02:48,782 --> 00:02:52,057
Yes, Clarence. 
A man down on earth needs our help.

23
00:02:52,057 --> 00:02:53,551
Splendid! Is he sick?

24
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:55,862
No. Worse. He's discouraged.

25
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:58,779
At exactly ten forty-five P.M., 
earth-time,

26
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:02,637
that man will be thinking seriously 
of throwing away God's greatest gift.

27
00:03:02,637 --> 00:03:06,717
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then 
I have only an hour to dress.

28
00:03:06,717 --> 00:03:07,730
What are they wearing now?

29
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,098
You will spend that hour getting 
acquainted with George Bailey.

30
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:17,604
Sir ...If I should accomplish this mission ...
I mean, uh, might I perhaps win my wings?

31
00:03:17,604 --> 00:03:20,121
I've been waiting for over 
two hundred years now, sir ...

32
00:03:20,121 --> 00:03:21,835
and people are beginning to talk.

33
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:23,155
What's that book you've got there?

34
00:03:23,155 --> 00:03:25,634
Oh, 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.'

35
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:29,199
Clarence, you do a good job with 
George Bailey and you'll get your wings.

36
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,306
Oh, thank you, sir. 
Thank you.

37
00:03:31,306 --> 00:03:34,038
Poor George. Sit down.

38
00:03:34,038 --> 00:03:35,512
Sit down?! What are we ...

39
00:03:35,512 --> 00:03:39,559
If you're going to help a man, you want 
to know something about him, don't you?

40
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:43,383
- Well, naturally, of course, I ...
- Well, keep your eyes open.

41
00:03:43,383 --> 00:03:47,240
- See the town?
- Where? I — I don't see a thing.

42
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,306
Oh, I forgot. You haven't 
got your wings yet.

43
00:03:50,306 --> 00:03:52,206
Now look, I'll help you out.

44
00:03:52,206 --> 00:03:54,057
Concentrate.

45
00:03:54,057 --> 00:03:55,736
Begin to see something?

46
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,539
Why, yes! This is amazing!

47
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:01,170
If you ever get your wings, 
you'll see all by yourself.

48
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,001
Oh, wonderful!

49
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:05,912
Yippee!

50
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,495
Okay, boys, let's go.

51
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:09,628
Hey, who's that?

52
00:04:09,628 --> 00:04:12,545
- That's your problem, George Bailey.
- A boy?!

53
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:15,831
That's him when he was twelve. 
Back in nineteen nineteen.

54
00:04:15,831 --> 00:04:19,200
Something happens here 
you'll have to remember later on.

55
00:04:20,405 --> 00:04:26,121
Come on, Marty. 
Come on, Marty.

56
00:04:27,137 --> 00:04:31,268
- Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw!

57
00:04:31,268 --> 00:04:35,638
And here comes the scare-baby, 
my kid brother, Harry Bailey!

58
00:04:35,638 --> 00:04:37,716
I'm not scared!

59
00:04:40,743 --> 00:04:46,690
Go, Harry! C'mon, Harry! 
Attaboy, Harry! Come on, Harry!

60
00:04:47,465 --> 00:04:51,055
Help, George! Help! Help!

61
00:04:51,055 --> 00:04:53,820
... Harry, I'm coming!

62
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,244
- Help!
- Hang on, Harry!

63
00:04:56,244 --> 00:04:58,698
I'm coming! Chain Gang!

64
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,812
George saved his brother's 
life that day.

65
00:05:01,812 --> 00:05:05,457
But it caught him that cold 
which infected his left ear.

66
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:07,876
Cost him his hearing in that ear.

67
00:05:07,876 --> 00:05:11,539
It was weeks before he was able to 
go back to his after-school job

68
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:14,307
at old man Gower's Drugstore.

69
00:05:14,307 --> 00:05:15,696
Mr. Potter!

70
00:05:15,696 --> 00:05:17,885
Who's that? A king?

71
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:20,077
That's Henry F. Potter.

72
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:23,582
The richest and meanest man 
in the county.

73
00:05:27,376 --> 00:05:36,799
Hee-haw! Hee-haw! 
Go to work, slave ...

74
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:44,452
I wish I had a million dollars! 
Hot dog!

75
00:05:44,452 --> 00:05:46,456
It's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey.

76
00:05:46,456 --> 00:05:48,622
- You're late
- Yes, sir.

77
00:05:57,172 --> 00:06:00,678
Hello, George. Hello, Mary.

78
00:06:00,678 --> 00:06:01,964
Hello, Violet.

79
00:06:01,964 --> 00:06:03,455
Two-cents' worth of shoelaces?

80
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:04,930
She was here first.

81
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,886
I'm still thinking.

82
00:06:06,886 --> 00:06:07,911
Shoelaces?

83
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:11,546
Please, Georgie. 
I like him.

84
00:06:11,546 --> 00:06:13,329
You like every boy.

85
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:15,260
What's wrong with that?

86
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,468
Here you are.

87
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:20,202
- Help me down.
- Help you down?!

88
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,052
Made up your mind yet?

89
00:06:29,052 --> 00:06:30,902
I'll take chocolate.

90
00:06:30,902 --> 00:06:32,119
With coconuts?

91
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:33,952
I don't like coconuts.

92
00:06:33,952 --> 00:06:35,896
You don't like coconuts?

93
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,842
Say, brainless, don't you know 
where coconuts come from?

94
00:06:39,842 --> 00:06:44,705
Look it here ... from Tahiti, 
Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea!

95
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:47,814
A new magazine! 
I never saw it before.

96
00:06:47,814 --> 00:06:49,100
Of course you never.

97
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,136
Only us explorers can get it.

98
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:56,239
I've been nominated for membership 
in the National Geographic Society.

99
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:59,077
Is this the ear you can't hear on?

100
00:06:59,077 --> 00:07:02,560
George Bailey, 
I'll love you till the day I die.

101
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,486
I'm going out exploring some day, 
you watch.

102
00:07:05,486 --> 00:07:09,026
And I'm gonna have a couple of harems, 
and maybe three or four wives.

103
00:07:09,026 --> 00:07:10,379
Wait and see.

104
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:16,335
- George! George!
- Yes, sir.

105
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:19,392
You're not paid to be a canary.

106
00:07:19,392 --> 00:07:20,755
No, sir ...

107
00:07:48,017 --> 00:07:50,151
Mr. Gower, do you want something?

108
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:52,737
- Anything?
- No.

109
00:07:52,737 --> 00:07:56,010
- Anything I can do back here?
- Nope.

110
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,400
I'll get them, sir.

111
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,762
... take those capsules 
over to Mrs. Blaine's.

112
00:08:01,762 --> 00:08:03,889
- She's waiting for them.
- Yes, sir ...

113
00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:29,111
They have the diphtheria there, 
haven't they, sir?

114
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:30,261
Ummm.

115
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:32,110
Is it a charge, sir?

116
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,197
Yes, charge.

117
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:36,744
- Mr. Gower, I think ...
- Aw, get going!

118
00:08:36,744 --> 00:08:37,949
Yes, sir.

119
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,432
Fast there, Captain Cook! 
Where you headin'?

120
00:09:06,432 --> 00:09:07,709
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.

121
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:09,730
- Some other time, George.
- It's important!

122
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,422
There's a squall in there 
that's shapin' up into a storm.

123
00:09:12,422 --> 00:09:13,794
Uncle Billy, telephone.

124
00:09:13,794 --> 00:09:15,923
- Who is it?
- The Bank examiner.

125
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:17,421
Bank examiner?

126
00:09:17,421 --> 00:09:19,645
Oh, I should have 
called him yesterday.

127
00:09:19,645 --> 00:09:21,209
Switch it inside.

129
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:24,694
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.

130
00:09:24,694 --> 00:09:26,560
Well, you're begging 
and that's a whole lot worse.

131
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,631
All I'm asking for 
is thirty days more.

132
00:09:28,631 --> 00:09:29,732
- Pop!
- Just a minute, son.

133
00:09:29,732 --> 00:09:32,586
Just thirty short days. I'll dig up 
that five thousand somehow.

134
00:09:32,586 --> 00:09:34,279
- Shove me up. Shove me up.
- Pop!

135
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:38,549
Have you put any real pressure on these 
people of yours to pay those mortgages?

136
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:40,978
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. 
A lot of these people are out of work.

137
00:09:40,978 --> 00:09:42,907
- Then foreclose!
- I can't do that.

138
00:09:42,907 --> 00:09:44,347
- These families have children.
- Pop!

139
00:09:44,347 --> 00:09:45,538
They're not my children.

140
00:09:45,538 --> 00:09:47,439
But they're somebody's 
children, Mr. Potter.

141
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:50,104
Are you running a business 
or a charity ward?

142
00:09:50,104 --> 00:09:52,344
- Well, all right ...
- Not with my money.

143
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:54,992
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a 
hard-skulled character?

144
00:09:54,992 --> 00:09:56,875
You have no family, no children.

145
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,853
You can't begin to spend all the 
money you've got.

146
00:09:58,853 --> 00:10:02,715
So I suppose I should give it to 
miserable failures like you ...

147
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:05,419
and that idiot brother of yours 
to spend for me.

148
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:06,862
He's not a failure!

149
00:10:06,862 --> 00:10:09,169
- You can't say that about my father!
- George, George, quiet. George, George ...

150
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:10,909
You're not! 
You're the biggest man in town!

151
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:12,105
- Run along.
- Bigger than him.

152
00:10:12,105 --> 00:10:13,425
- Run along!
- Bigger than everybody!

153
00:10:13,425 --> 00:10:14,931
Gives you an idea of the Baileys.

154
00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:16,802
Don't let him say things like that 
about you, Pop.

155
00:10:16,802 --> 00:10:17,847
All right, son. All right.

156
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:20,001
Thanks. I'll talk to you tonight.

157
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,926
What!

158
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:32,641
Why, that medicine should 
have been there an hour ago.

159
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:35,438
It'll be over in 
five minutes, Mrs. Blaine.

160
00:10:39,112 --> 00:10:41,483
Where's Mrs. Blaine's 
box of capsules?

161
00:10:41,483 --> 00:10:43,271
I feel ...

162
00:10:43,996 --> 00:10:46,306
- Didn't you hear what I said?
- Yes, sir, I ...

163
00:10:46,306 --> 00:10:48,730
What kind of tricks 
are you playing anyway?

164
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:53,903
Why didn't you 
deliver them right away?

165
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,280
Don't you know that boy's very sick?

166
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,977
You're hurting my sore ear.

167
00:10:56,977 --> 00:10:58,537
You lazy loafer!

168
00:10:58,537 --> 00:11:00,852
Mr. Gower, you don't know 
what you're doing.

169
00:11:00,852 --> 00:11:02,650
You put something wrong 
in those capsules.

170
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,040
I know you're unhappy.

171
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,803
You got that telegram 
and you're upset.

172
00:11:05,803 --> 00:11:07,654
You put something 
bad in those capsules.

173
00:11:07,654 --> 00:11:09,532
It wasn't your fault, Mr. Gower.

174
00:11:11,263 --> 00:11:12,909
Just look and see what you did.

175
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:14,400
Look at the bottle 
you took the powder from.

176
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,159
It's poison! 
I tell you it's poison!

177
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:19,194
I know you feel bad.

178
00:11:19,194 --> 00:11:20,196
I didn't know ...

179
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,964
- Oh ...
- Don't hurt my sore ear again.

180
00:11:25,964 --> 00:11:27,290
- Don't hurt my sore ear again.
- Oh, no, no, no ...

181
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,361
Oh, George. George ...

182
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:33,101
Oh, Mr. Gower, 
I won't ever tell anyone.

183
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:34,608
I know what you're feeling.

184
00:11:34,608 --> 00:11:36,100
I won't tell a soul.

185
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,276
- Hope to die, I won't.
- Oh, George, George ...

186
00:11:39,276 --> 00:11:42,093
An overnight bag, 
genuine English cowhide,

187
00:11:42,093 --> 00:11:44,275
combination lock, 
fitted up with brushes, combs ...

188
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:46,824
Nope! 
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

189
00:11:46,824 --> 00:11:49,272
Now look, Joe. 
Now look,

190
00:11:49,272 --> 00:11:52,125
I, I — I want a big one.

191
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,344
What did you stop it for?

192
00:11:53,344 --> 00:11:56,788
I want you to take 
a good look at that face.

193
00:11:56,788 --> 00:11:58,823
- Who is it?
- George Bailey.

194
00:11:58,823 --> 00:12:02,100
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears 
slapped back by the druggist?

195
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,763
That's the kid.

196
00:12:03,763 --> 00:12:06,452
Uh-huh. It's a good face.

197
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:09,974
I like it. 
I like George Bailey.

198
00:12:09,974 --> 00:12:12,485
Tell me, did he ever tell anyone 
about the pills?

199
00:12:12,485 --> 00:12:14,011
Not a soul.

200
00:12:14,011 --> 00:12:16,830
Did he ever marry the girl? 
Did he ever go exploring?

201
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,341
Well, wait and see.

202
00:12:19,341 --> 00:12:21,379
Big ...see ...
I, I don't want one for one night.

203
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:23,590
I want something for a thousand 
and one nights.

204
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:28,140
With plenty of room here for labels 
from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand ...

205
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,328
a great big one.

206
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:31,274
- I see, a flying carpet, huh?
- Yeah.

207
00:12:31,274 --> 00:12:34,116
I don't suppose you'd like this 
old second-hand job, would you?

208
00:12:34,116 --> 00:12:35,409
Now you're talking.

209
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:38,375
Gee whiz, I could use that 
as a raft in case the boat sunk.

210
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,330
- How much does this cost?
- No charge.

211
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,655
That's my trick ear, Joe. 
It sounded as if you said no charge.

212
00:12:43,655 --> 00:12:44,683
That's right.

213
00:12:45,856 --> 00:12:47,468
Well, what's my name doing on it here?

214
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:50,279
A little present form old man Gower. 
Came down and picked it out himself.

215
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,322
He did?!

216
00:12:51,322 --> 00:12:54,252
What do you know about that ...
my old boss. Isn't that nice?

217
00:12:54,252 --> 00:12:55,301
What boat you sailing on?

218
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:56,948
I'm working across on a cattle boat.

219
00:12:56,948 --> 00:12:59,322
- A cattle boat?
- Okay, I like cows.

220
00:13:01,485 --> 00:13:03,202
- Hello, Mr. Gower.
- George!

221
00:13:03,202 --> 00:13:05,127
How are you? 
Thanks ever so much for the baggage.

222
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:06,426
- It's just exactly what I wanted.
- Aw, forget it.

223
00:13:06,426 --> 00:13:07,837
Oh, it's wonderful 
of you to think of it.

224
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:09,999
- Hope you enjoy it.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

225
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:13,369
I wish I had a million dollars. 
Hot dog!

226
00:13:13,369 --> 00:13:16,223
Avast there, Captain Cook! 
You got your sealegs yet?

227
00:13:16,223 --> 00:13:17,713
Parlez vous Francais, Mister?

228
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,740
Hey, send us some of their picture 
postcards, will you, George?

229
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,623
Hey, George, 
don't take any plugged nickels.

230
00:13:21,623 --> 00:13:23,642
Hey, George, 
your suitcase is leaking.

231
00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:26,055
Hey, Ernie! Hi, Ernie!

232
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,087
- Hiya, George.
- Hi, Bert.

233
00:13:27,087 --> 00:13:29,141
- George ...
- Hey, hey, I, I'm a rich tourist today.

234
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,882
- How about driving me home in style?
- Great.

235
00:13:30,882 --> 00:13:34,201
Hop in Your Highness, hop in. 
And for the carriage trade.

236
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:35,828
I put on my hat.

237
00:13:37,798 --> 00:13:41,011
- Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
- Hello, Violet.

238
00:13:41,011 --> 00:13:43,191
Hey, you look good. 
That's some dress you got on there.

239
00:13:43,191 --> 00:13:44,869
What! This old thing?

240
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:47,178
Why, I only wear it when 
I don't care how I look.

241
00:14:02,762 --> 00:14:04,557
- How would you like ...
- Yes.

242
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:08,255
Want to come along, Bert? 
We'll show you the town.

243
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:12,471
No, thanks. I, uh, I've gotta go home 
and see what the wife's doing.

244
00:14:14,662 --> 00:14:15,836
Family man.

245
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,039
George! Harry!

246
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:21,329
You're shaking the house down! 
Stop it!

247
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:24,283
Oh, let them alone! 
I wish I was up there with them.

248
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:27,102
But Harry'll tear his dinner suit! 
George!

249
00:14:27,102 --> 00:14:29,257
That's why all children should be girls.

250
00:14:29,257 --> 00:14:31,534
But if they were all girls, 
there wouldn't be any ...

251
00:14:31,534 --> 00:14:33,102
Oh, never mind.

252
00:14:33,102 --> 00:14:35,597
George! Harry! 
Come down to dinner this minute.

253
00:14:35,597 --> 00:14:38,552
Everything's getting cold and you know, 
how long we've been waiting for you.

254
00:14:38,552 --> 00:14:40,308
Okay, Mom!

255
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:53,628
- Here's a present for you, Pop.
- Oh, you two idiots!

256
00:14:53,628 --> 00:14:55,677
- George, sit down and have dinner.
- I've eaten.

257
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:58,148
Well, aren't you going to finish 
dressing for your graduating party?

258
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:59,353
- Look at you!
- I don't care.

259
00:14:59,353 --> 00:15:01,994
It's George's tux. Annie, my sweet, 
have you got those pies?

260
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:04,403
If you lay a hand on me, 
I'll hit you with this broom.

261
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,861
Annie, I'm in love with you, 
there's a moon out tonight.

262
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:11,699
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, my last meal 
in the old Bailey Boarding House.

263
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:13,904
Oh, my lands, my blood pressure!

264
00:15:13,904 --> 00:15:16,264
Pop, can I have the car? I have to 
take over a lot of plates and things.

265
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:17,530
- What plates?
- Oh, Mom,

266
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:20,015
I'm Chairman of the Eats Committee 
and we only need a couple of dozen.

267
00:15:20,015 --> 00:15:22,529
Oh, no, you don't. 
Harry, now, not my best Haviland.

268
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:25,602
Oh, let him have the plates, Mother.

269
00:15:25,602 --> 00:15:28,423
Hope you have a good trip, George. 
Uncle Billy and I are gonna miss you.

270
00:15:28,423 --> 00:15:31,565
I'll miss you too, Pop. 
What's the matter? You look tired.

271
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:34,125
- Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
- Oh.

272
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:37,077
I thought when we put him on the board 
of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.

273
00:15:37,077 --> 00:15:39,932
Oh, what's eating that 
old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?

274
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:42,526
Oh, he's a sick man. 
Frustrated and sick.

275
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:45,201
And his mind's sick in his soul, 
if he has one.

276
00:15:45,201 --> 00:15:48,095
He hates everybody that has 
anything that he can't have.

277
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:49,805
He hates us mostly, I guess.

278
00:15:49,805 --> 00:15:51,487
Gangway! Gangway! 
So long, Pop.

279
00:15:51,487 --> 00:15:52,743
So long!

280
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,759
- Harry, you got a match?
- Very funny. Very funny.

281
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,174
Put those things in the car and I'll 
get your tie and studs ready for you.

282
00:15:57,174 --> 00:15:58,845
- Now, hurry up, hurry up.
- Okay, Mom.

283
00:15:58,845 --> 00:15:59,996
- You coming later?
- Don't you drop one of those.

284
00:15:59,996 --> 00:16:01,247
- You coming later, George?
- What do you mean,

285
00:16:01,247 --> 00:16:03,185
- and be bored to death?
- Couldn't want a better death.

286
00:16:03,185 --> 00:16:05,406
Lots of pretty girls, and we're going 
to use that new floor tonight, too.

287
00:16:05,406 --> 00:16:07,261
- Oh, I hope it works.
- No gin tonight, son!

288
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:09,806
- Aw, Pop, just a little.
- No, son. Not one drop.

289
00:16:09,806 --> 00:16:11,023
Oh!

290
00:16:11,023 --> 00:16:15,240
Boys and girls and music ...
why do they need gin?

291
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,332
Father, did I act like that when 
I graduated from high school?

292
00:16:18,332 --> 00:16:19,391
Pretty much.

293
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,752
You know, George, I wish we could 
send Harry to college with you.

294
00:16:22,752 --> 00:16:24,312
Your mother and I talked it over 
half the night.

295
00:16:24,312 --> 00:16:27,619
Mmm, we have that all figured out.

296
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,728
Harry'll take my job at the Building 
and Loan, and work there four years,

297
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:32,007
then he'll go.

298
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,984
- He's pretty young for that job.
- Well, no younger than I was.

299
00:16:35,984 --> 00:16:38,066
Maybe you were born older, George.

300
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,810
How's that?

301
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,548
I say, you were born older.

302
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:45,773
I suppose you've decided what you 
want to do when you get out of college.

303
00:16:45,773 --> 00:16:48,805
Oh well, you know what I've always 
talked about ... build things ...

304
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:51,252
design new buildings ...
plan modern cities ...

305
00:16:51,252 --> 00:16:54,136
- all that stuff, I was talking about.
- Still after that first million before you're thirty.

306
00:16:54,136 --> 00:16:55,575
No, I'll settle for half that in cash.

307
00:16:57,442 --> 00:17:00,689
'Course it's just a hope, but uh,

308
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:03,229
you wouldn't consider coming back 
to the Building and Loan, would you?

309
00:17:05,844 --> 00:17:11,804
Well, I — I ... Why, Annie, why, 
why don't you draw up a chair?

310
00:17:11,804 --> 00:17:14,846
Then you'd be more comfortable and 
you could hear everything that's going on.

311
00:17:14,846 --> 00:17:17,281
I would if I thought I'd hear 
anything worth listening to.

312
00:17:17,281 --> 00:17:19,231
You would, eh?

313
00:17:19,231 --> 00:17:23,094
- I know it's soon to talk about it.
- Oh, now, Pop. I, I,

314
00:17:23,094 --> 00:17:30,471
I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for 
the rest of my life in a shabby little office ...

315
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:32,959
Oh, I'm sorry, Pop, 
I didn't mean it that way,

316
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:37,421
but this business of nickels and 
dimes and spending all your life ...

317
00:17:37,421 --> 00:17:41,102
trying to figure out how to save three 
cents on a length of pipe ... I'd go crazy.

318
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,734
I — I wanna do something big 
and something important.

319
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:48,291
You know, George, I feel that in a small 
way we are doing something important.

320
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,634
Satisfying a fundamental urge.

321
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:55,123
It's deep in the race for a man to want 
his own roof and walls and fireplace.

322
00:17:55,123 --> 00:17:58,658
And we're helping him get those 
things in our shabby little office.

323
00:17:58,658 --> 00:18:05,852
I know, Pop. I, uh, I, I know that I,
I ... I wish I felt ...

324
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:09,645
but I, I've been hoarding pennies 
like a miser here in order to ...

325
00:18:09,645 --> 00:18:11,898
Most of my friends 
have already finished college.

326
00:18:11,898 --> 00:18:15,468
I, uh, I just feel like if I 
didn't get away, I'd bust.

327
00:18:15,468 --> 00:18:20,617
Yes, yes. You're right, son.

328
00:18:20,617 --> 00:18:22,518
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?

329
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:26,515
This town is no place for any man unless 
he's willing to crawl to Potter.

330
00:18:26,515 --> 00:18:29,818
And you've got talent, son. 
I've seen it.

331
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:33,218
You get yourself an education. 
Then get out of here.

332
00:18:35,527 --> 00:18:38,911
Pop, you want a shock?

333
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:40,917
I think you're a great guy.

334
00:18:44,522 --> 00:18:45,948
Oh, did you hear that, Annie?

335
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:49,789
I heard it. About time one 
of you lunkheads said it.

336
00:18:51,178 --> 00:18:52,982
I'm going to miss old Annie.

337
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,918
Pop, I think I'll get dressed 
and go over to Harry's party.

338
00:18:59,918 --> 00:19:01,338
Have a good time, son.

339
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:09,200
Here you are.

340
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,401
George! Hello!

341
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:12,676
You know my kid brother, George?
I'm going to put him through college.

342
00:19:12,676 --> 00:19:15,357
- Hello, George! 
- Hee-haw!

343
00:19:15,357 --> 00:19:16,957
Oh, oh, Sam Wainwright.

344
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:18,259
How are you? 
When did you get here?

345
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:20,551
Oh, this afternoon. 
I thought I'd give the kids a treat.

346
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:22,012
Old college graduate now, huh?

347
00:19:22,012 --> 00:19:24,203
Yeah. Old Joe College Wainwright, 
they call me.

348
00:19:24,203 --> 00:19:26,769
Well, freshman, looks like 
you're going to make it after all.

349
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:27,842
- Yep.
- Hey, hey!

350
00:19:27,842 --> 00:19:30,055
Harry! 
You're the guy I want to see.

351
00:19:30,055 --> 00:19:31,703
- The Coach has heard all about you.
- He has?

352
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,681
Yeah. He's followed every game 
and his mouth's watering.

353
00:19:33,681 --> 00:19:35,478
He wants me to find out if you're 
going to come along with us.

354
00:19:35,478 --> 00:19:37,480
Well, I eh, 
I gotta make some dough first.

355
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,012
Well, you'd better make it fast. 
We need great ends like you.

356
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,134
not broken-down old guys 
like this one!

357
00:19:42,134 --> 00:19:43,428
- Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw!

358
00:19:43,428 --> 00:19:45,856
George! Welcome back!

359
00:19:45,856 --> 00:19:47,442
Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you?

360
00:19:47,442 --> 00:19:49,452
Putting a pool under this floor 
was a great idea.

361
00:19:49,452 --> 00:19:50,619
Saved us another building.

362
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:52,672
Now, Harry, Sam, have a lot of fun.

363
00:19:52,672 --> 00:19:54,052
There's lots of stuff here 
to eat and drink.

364
00:19:54,052 --> 00:19:58,339
- Lots of pretty girls around.
- Hey, George ...

365
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:00,988
- Hello, Violet. How are you ...
- Hello. What am I bid?

366
00:20:00,988 --> 00:20:04,076
- George ...
- Marty. Well, it's old home week.

367
00:20:04,076 --> 00:20:06,262
Marty! 
Glad to see you.

368
00:20:06,262 --> 00:20:08,229
- Do me a favor, will you, George?
- What's that?

369
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:10,690
- Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

370
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,356
"Mamma wants you, Marty." 
"Mama wants you." Remember?

371
00:20:13,356 --> 00:20:14,389
Dance with her, will you?

372
00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:17,448
Oh, me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough 
already, with all these kids.

373
00:20:17,448 --> 00:20:18,448
Aw, come on. Be a sport.

374
00:20:18,448 --> 00:20:21,165
Just dance with her one time and 
you'll give her the thrill of her life.

375
00:20:21,165 --> 00:20:22,229
- Aw, go on.
- Hey, sis!

376
00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:25,328
And don't be long, Marty! 
I don't want to be a wet nurse for ...

377
00:20:25,328 --> 00:20:27,655
And the next thing I knew, 
some guy came up and tripped me.

378
00:20:27,655 --> 00:20:29,675
That's the reason why I came in fourth.

379
00:20:29,675 --> 00:20:32,428
If it hadn't been for that, that 
race would have been a cinch.

380
00:20:32,428 --> 00:20:35,546
I tried to find out who it was 
later but I couldn't find out.

381
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:39,633
Nobody'd ever tell you who ... whoever, 
whoever it was because they'd be scared.

382
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:41,780
- They know what kind of a guy I am ...
- You remember George?

383
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,895
- This is Mary. Well, I'll be seeing you.
- Well ... well ... well ...

384
00:20:45,895 --> 00:20:48,706
Now, to get back 
to my story, see ...

385
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,918
Hey, this is my dance.

386
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,870
Oh, why don't you stop 
annoying people?

387
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,847
Well, I'm sorry. Hey!

388
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:03,415
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

389
00:21:03,415 --> 00:21:06,851
- You look at me as if you didn't know me.
- Well, I don't.

390
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:09,193
You've passed me on the street 
almost every day.

391
00:21:09,193 --> 00:21:10,858
- Me?! 
- Uh-huh. Uh-uh.

392
00:21:10,858 --> 00:21:13,907
That was a little girl named 
Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.

393
00:21:13,907 --> 00:21:15,637
O-yes, o-yes, o-yes!

394
00:21:15,637 --> 00:21:18,203
The big Charleston contest!

395
00:21:20,138 --> 00:21:22,432
The prize? A genuine loving cup!

396
00:21:22,432 --> 00:21:26,530
Those not tapped by the judges 
will remain on the floor. Let's go!

397
00:21:36,785 --> 00:21:39,764
- I'm not very good at this.
- Neither am I.

398
00:21:39,764 --> 00:21:41,374
Okay. What can we lose?

399
00:21:53,506 --> 00:21:55,067
Hey, you're wonderful!

400
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:25,222
What's the matter, Othello, 
jealous?

401
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,348
Did you know there's a swimming 
pool under this floor?

402
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:35,445
And did you know that button behind 
you causes this floor to open up?

403
00:22:35,445 --> 00:22:42,603
And did you further know that George 
Bailey is dancing right over that crack?

404
00:22:42,603 --> 00:22:44,639
And I've got the key?

405
00:23:06,891 --> 00:23:09,864
Stand back, everybody! 
Stand back!

406
00:23:14,152 --> 00:23:16,307
They're cheering us. 
We must be good.

407
00:23:55,192 --> 00:23:58,524
Get out! Oh, well ...

408
00:24:05,081 --> 00:24:07,277
♪ Buffalo Gals, 
can't you come out tonight? ♪

- Oh, Hot dog! Just like an organ.
- Beautiful.

414
00:24:27,802 --> 00:24:29,875
I told Harry I thought 
I'd be bored to death.

415
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,724
You, you should have seen the 
commotion in that locker room.

416
00:24:31,724 --> 00:24:34,738
I, I had to knock off three people 
to get this stuff we're wearing here.

417
00:24:34,738 --> 00:24:37,281
Here, let me, let me 
hold that old wet dress of yours.

418
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:38,729
Do I look as funny as you do?

419
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:40,324
I guess I'm not quite 
the football type.

420
00:24:40,324 --> 00:24:43,111
I ... You, you look wonderful!

421
00:24:43,111 --> 00:24:46,344
You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say 
you were the prettiest girl in town.

422
00:24:47,785 --> 00:24:50,197
Well, why don't you say it?

423
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:53,232
Well, I don't know. Maybe I will 
say it. How old are you anyway?

424
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:57,190
- Eighteen.
- Eighteen?!

425
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,929
Why, it was only last year 
you were seventeen.

426
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:01,269
Too young or too old?

427
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:04,719
Oh, no, no. Just right. 
Your age fits you.

428
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:07,692
Yes, sir, you look a little older 
without your clothes on.

429
00:25:07,692 --> 00:25:11,315
I, I mean, without a dress. 
You look older.

430
00:25:11,315 --> 00:25:14,165
I, I mean, younger. 
You look ... y-y-you just look ...

431
00:25:14,165 --> 00:25:15,504
- Oh, oh!
- Oh, oh!

432
00:25:15,504 --> 00:25:19,244
- Oh, no. I wanna ...
- Sir, my train, please!

433
00:25:19,244 --> 00:25:21,972
A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.

434
00:25:21,972 --> 00:25:25,439
Your — your caboose, me lady.

435
00:25:26,423 --> 00:25:29,076
- You may kiss my hand.
- Ummm.

436
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,412
Hey.

437
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:35,668
Hey, Mary.

438
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,761
As I was lumbering 
down the street,

439
00:25:39,761 --> 00:25:42,361
down the street, 
down the street ...

440
00:25:42,361 --> 00:25:44,569
Okay then, I'll throw a rock 
at the old Granville house.

441
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:46,899
Oh, no, don't! 
I — I love that old house.

442
00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:49,139
No. You see, you make a wish 
and then try and break some glass.

443
00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:50,758
And you got to be a pretty good 
shot nowadays, too.

444
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,149
Oh, no, George, don't.

445
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:54,509
It's full of romance, 
that old place.

446
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:56,390
I'd like to live in it.

447
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,000
- In that place?!
- Uh-huh.

448
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,768
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. 
Now watch.

449
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,660
There's a window right on 
the second floor there, see?

450
00:26:07,297 --> 00:26:10,979
- What did you wish, George?
- Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful.

451
00:26:10,979 --> 00:26:12,946
Mary, I know what 
I'm gonna do tomorrow ...

452
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,644
and the next day and the next 
year and the year after that.

453
00:26:15,644 --> 00:26:18,665
I'm shaking the dust of this 
crummy little town off my feet ...

454
00:26:18,665 --> 00:26:20,376
and I'm gonna see the world.

455
00:26:20,376 --> 00:26:23,830
Italy, Greece, the Parthenon ...
the Colesseum.

456
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,293
Then I'm coming back here and go to 
college and see what they know ...

457
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,998
and then I'm going to build things.

458
00:26:27,998 --> 00:26:29,558
I'm gonna build air fields.

459
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:32,237
I'm gonna build skyscrapers a 
hundred stories high.

460
00:26:32,237 --> 00:26:34,804
I'm gonna build 
bridges a mile long.

461
00:26:34,804 --> 00:26:36,135
Well, are you gonna throw a rock?

462
00:26:41,108 --> 00:26:42,395
Hey, that's pretty good.

463
00:26:43,446 --> 00:26:44,869
What'd you wish, Mary?

464
00:26:48,376 --> 00:26:50,651
Buffalo Gals, 
Can't you come out tonight?

465
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:53,593
Can't you come out tonight?
Can't you come out tonight?

466
00:26:53,593 --> 00:26:56,535
Buffalo Gal, 
Can't you come out tonight?

467
00:26:56,535 --> 00:27:03,612
And dance by the light of the moon.

468
00:27:03,612 --> 00:27:05,464
What'd you wish 
when you threw that rock?

469
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:07,293
- Oh, no.
- Come on, tell me.

470
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,243
If I told you, 
it might not come true.

471
00:27:09,243 --> 00:27:11,149
What is it you want, Mary?

472
00:27:11,149 --> 00:27:12,199
What do you want?

473
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:13,998
You, you want the moon?!

474
00:27:13,998 --> 00:27:17,501
Just say the word and I'll throw a 
lasso around it and pull it down.

475
00:27:17,501 --> 00:27:19,914
Hey, that's a pretty good idea.

476
00:27:19,914 --> 00:27:24,804
- I'll give you the moon, Mary.
- I'll take it. Then what?

477
00:27:24,804 --> 00:27:26,519
Well then, you could swallow it,

478
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,626
and it'd all dissolve, see?

479
00:27:28,626 --> 00:27:32,011
And the moon beams'd shoot out 
of your fingers and your toes ...

480
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:33,965
and the ends of your hair.

481
00:27:35,602 --> 00:27:36,957
Am I talking too much?

482
00:27:36,957 --> 00:27:38,240
Yes!

483
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:41,539
Why don't you kiss her 
instead of talking her to death?

484
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:42,605
How's that?

485
00:27:42,605 --> 00:27:45,642
Why don't you kiss her 
instead of talking her to death?

486
00:27:47,887 --> 00:27:49,122
Want me to kiss her, huh?

487
00:27:49,122 --> 00:27:53,915
Aw, youth is wasted 
on the wrong people!

488
00:27:53,915 --> 00:27:57,278
Hey, hey, hold on. 
Hey, mister, come on back out here.

489
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:00,055
I'll show you some kissing 
that'll put hair back on your head.

490
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:01,384
What are you ...

491
00:28:09,051 --> 00:28:10,219
Mary?

492
00:28:21,214 --> 00:28:23,492
Okay, I give up. Where are you?

493
00:28:23,492 --> 00:28:26,702
Over here, in the hydrangea bushes.

494
00:28:28,024 --> 00:28:30,170
Here you are. Catch.

495
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,860
Wait a minute. What am I doing?

496
00:28:36,825 --> 00:28:39,390
This is a very interesting situation!

497
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:43,046
- Please give me my robe.
- Hmm.

498
00:28:43,046 --> 00:28:45,788
A man doesn't get in a situation 
like this every day.

499
00:28:45,788 --> 00:28:47,827
I'd like to have my robe.

500
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:49,489
Not in Bedford Falls anyway.

501
00:28:49,489 --> 00:28:52,610
- Ooooouch! Oh!
- Gesundheit.

502
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,596
- George Bailey!
- This requires a little thought here.

503
00:28:54,596 --> 00:28:56,378
Give me my robe!

504
00:28:56,378 --> 00:28:58,724
I've read about things like this, 
but I never ...

505
00:28:58,724 --> 00:29:01,757
Shame on you! I'm going to 
tell your mother on you!

506
00:29:01,757 --> 00:29:04,955
Oh, my mother's way up on the corner over there.

507
00:29:04,955 --> 00:29:06,773
I'll call the police!

508
00:29:06,773 --> 00:29:09,321
They're way downtown. 
They'd be on my side, too.

509
00:29:09,321 --> 00:29:12,265
Then, then, 
then I'm going to scream!

510
00:29:12,265 --> 00:29:14,960
Maybe I could sell tickets.

511
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,154
Let's see. No, no, the point is, 
in order to get this robe ...

512
00:29:20,154 --> 00:29:23,325
I've got it. I'll make 
a deal with you, Mary.

513
00:29:23,325 --> 00:29:25,130
George! 
George!

514
00:29:27,923 --> 00:29:30,181
George! Come on home. Quick.

515
00:29:30,181 --> 00:29:31,691
You father's had a stroke!

516
00:29:31,691 --> 00:29:32,807
What?!

517
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,970
Mary! Mary, I'm sorry. 
I've got to go.

518
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,069
Come on, George. Let's hurry!

519
00:29:36,069 --> 00:29:38,655
- Did you get a doctor?
- Yes. Campbell's there now.

520
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:52,470
I think that's all we'll need you for, George, 
I know you're anxious to make a train.

521
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,150
I have a taxi waiting downstairs.

522
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:57,124
I want the Board to know that George 
gave up his trip to Europe ...

523
00:29:57,124 --> 00:30:00,407
to help straighten things out 
here these past few months.

524
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:01,910
Good luck to you at school, George.

525
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,203
- Thanks.
- Good luck! So long!

526
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:06,773
Now we come to the real purpose 
of this meeting ...

527
00:30:06,773 --> 00:30:09,492
to appoint a successor 
to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.

528
00:30:09,492 --> 00:30:11,740
Mr. Chairman, 
I'd like to get to my real purpose.

529
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,004
- Wait just a minute now.
- Wait for what?

530
00:30:14,004 --> 00:30:17,530
I claim this institution is not 
necessary to this town.

531
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:21,811
Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I make a 
motion to dissolve this institution ...

532
00:30:21,811 --> 00:30:24,690
and turn its assets and liabilities 
over to the receiver.

533
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,233
Potter, you dirty, contemptible ...

534
00:30:26,233 --> 00:30:27,461
I'll wring his neck, so help me, 
George,

535
00:30:27,461 --> 00:30:29,072
- you hear what that buzzard ...
- Mr. Chairman,

536
00:30:29,072 --> 00:30:33,533
it's too soon after Peter Bailey's death to talk 
about chloroforming the Building and Loan.

537
00:30:33,533 --> 00:30:35,833
Peter Bailey died three months ago.

538
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,717
I second Mr. Potter's motion.

539
00:30:37,717 --> 00:30:41,689
Very well. In that case, I'll ask the 
two executive officers to withdraw.

540
00:30:41,689 --> 00:30:43,203
But before you go,

541
00:30:43,203 --> 00:30:46,149
I'm sure the whole Board wishes 
to express its deep sorrow ...

542
00:30:46,149 --> 00:30:48,587
- at the passing of Peter Bailey.
- Thank you very much.

543
00:30:48,587 --> 00:30:52,263
It was his faith and devotion that are 
responsible for this organization.

544
00:30:52,263 --> 00:30:54,258
I'll go further than that.

545
00:30:54,258 --> 00:30:58,869
I'll say that to the public, Peter 
Bailey was the Building and Loan.

546
00:30:58,869 --> 00:31:01,159
Oh, that's fine, 
Potter, coming from you,

547
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,151
considering that you probably 
drove him to his grave.

548
00:31:03,151 --> 00:31:06,188
Peter Bailey was not a business man.

549
00:31:06,188 --> 00:31:10,654
That's what killed him. Oh, I don't mean 
any disrespect to him, God rest his soul.

550
00:31:10,654 --> 00:31:14,500
He was a man of 
high ideals, so-called.

551
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,976
But ideals without common sense 
can ruin this town.

552
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:22,446
Now, you take this loan here 
to Ernie Bishop ...

553
00:31:22,446 --> 00:31:28,407
you know, that fellow that sits around 
all day on his brains in his taxi, you know.

554
00:31:28,407 --> 00:31:33,855
I happen to know the bank turned down 
this loan, but he comes here ...

555
00:31:33,855 --> 00:31:39,536
and we're building him a house 
worth five thousand dollars.

556
00:31:39,536 --> 00:31:41,948
- Why?
- Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter.

557
00:31:41,948 --> 00:31:43,255
You have all the papers there.

558
00:31:43,255 --> 00:31:46,249
His salary, insurance. I can 
personally vouch for his character.

559
00:31:46,249 --> 00:31:48,915
- A friend of yours.
- Yes, sir.

560
00:31:48,915 --> 00:31:52,472
You see, if you shoot pool with 
some employee here,

561
00:31:52,472 --> 00:31:55,131
you can come and borrow money.

562
00:31:55,131 --> 00:31:56,927
What does that get us?

563
00:31:56,927 --> 00:32:02,157
A discontented, lazy rabble 
instead of a thrifty working class.

564
00:32:02,157 --> 00:32:07,369
And all because a few starry-eyed 
dreamers like Peter Bailey ...

565
00:32:07,369 --> 00:32:11,572
stir them up and fill their heads 
with a lot of impossible ideas.

566
00:32:11,572 --> 00:32:14,110
- Now, I say ...
- Just a minute. Just a ...

567
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:16,541
Just a minute. 
Now, hold on, Mr. Potter.

568
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:19,772
You're right when you say my father 
was no business man. I know that.

569
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:23,087
Why he ever started this cheap penny-ante 
Building and Loan, I'll never know.

570
00:32:23,087 --> 00:32:26,476
But neither you nor anybody else can say 
anything against his character,

571
00:32:26,476 --> 00:32:28,462
because his whole life was ...

572
00:32:28,462 --> 00:32:31,159
Why, in the twenty-five years since 
he and Uncle Billy started this thing,

573
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:33,441
he never once thought of himself. 
Isn't that right, Uncle Billy?

574
00:32:33,441 --> 00:32:36,495
He didn't save enough money to 
send Harry to school, let alone me.

575
00:32:36,495 --> 00:32:39,294
But he did help a few people 
get out of your slums, Mr. Potter.

576
00:32:39,294 --> 00:32:40,598
And what's wrong with that?

577
00:32:40,598 --> 00:32:43,313
Why ... here, 
you are all businessmen here.

578
00:32:43,313 --> 00:32:46,451
Doesn't it make them better citizens? 
Doesn't it make them better customers?

579
00:32:46,451 --> 00:32:48,520
You — you said that uh ...
what'd you say just a minute ago ...

580
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,441
They, they had to wait and save their money 
before they even thought of a decent home.

581
00:32:52,441 --> 00:32:54,373
Wait! Wait for what?

582
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:55,862
Until their children grow up 
and leave them?

583
00:32:55,862 --> 00:32:58,312
Until they're so old 
and broken-down that they ...

584
00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:01,043
Do you know how long it takes a working 
man to save five thousand dollars?

585
00:33:01,043 --> 00:33:04,505
Just remember this, Mr. Potter, 
that this rabble you're talking about ...

586
00:33:04,505 --> 00:33:08,580
they do most of the working and paying 
and living and dying in this community.

587
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,843
Well, it is too much to have them 
work and pay and live and die ...

588
00:33:10,843 --> 00:33:12,876
in a couple of decent rooms 
and a bath?

589
00:33:12,876 --> 00:33:15,742
Anyway, my father didn't think so.

590
00:33:15,742 --> 00:33:17,232
People were human beings to him,

591
00:33:17,232 --> 00:33:21,137
but to you, a warped, 
frustrated old man, they're cattle.

592
00:33:21,137 --> 00:33:23,644
Well, in my book, he died a much 
richer man than you'll ever be.

593
00:33:23,644 --> 00:33:28,008
I'm not interested in your book. 
I'm talking about the Building and Loan.

594
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:29,869
I know very well 
what you're talking about.

595
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:33,181
You're talking about something you can't 
get your fingers on, and it's galling you.

596
00:33:33,181 --> 00:33:35,639
That's what you're 
talking about, I know.

597
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,469
Well, I, I, I've said too much.

598
00:33:37,469 --> 00:33:41,140
I ... You're, you're the Board here. 
You do what you want with this thing.

599
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,631
There's j-just one thing more though.

600
00:33:42,631 --> 00:33:45,795
This town needs this measly 
one-horse institution ...

601
00:33:45,795 --> 00:33:49,740
if only to have some place where people 
can come without crawling to Potter.

602
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,007
Come on, Uncle Billy.

603
00:33:56,564 --> 00:34:02,099
Sentimental hogwash. 
I want my motion.

604
00:34:02,099 --> 00:34:04,372
Oh boy, that was telling him, 
George, old boy.

605
00:34:04,372 --> 00:34:06,507
You shut his big mouth. 
You should have heard him.

606
00:34:06,507 --> 00:34:07,710
What happened? 
We heard a lot of yelling.

607
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:11,156
Well, we're being voted out of 
business after twenty-five years.

608
00:34:11,156 --> 00:34:12,626
Easy come, easy go.

609
00:34:12,626 --> 00:34:14,579
Here it is. 
"Help wanted — Female."

610
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:16,737
You still want me 
hang around, George?

611
00:34:16,737 --> 00:34:17,919
Yeah, I'll be right down.

612
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:19,182
Hey, you'll miss your train.

613
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,046
You're a week late for 
school already. Go on.

614
00:34:21,046 --> 00:34:23,984
- What's going on in there?
- Oh, never mind. Don't worry about that.

615
00:34:23,984 --> 00:34:26,113
They're putting us out of business. 
So what?

616
00:34:26,113 --> 00:34:28,294
I can get another job. 
I'm only fifty-five.

617
00:34:28,294 --> 00:34:29,992
- Fifty-six.
- Go on, go on.

618
00:34:29,992 --> 00:34:33,216
Hey, look, you gave up your boat trip, now 
you don't want to miss college, too, do you?

619
00:34:33,216 --> 00:34:34,415
George! 
George!

620
00:34:34,415 --> 00:34:36,846
They voted Potter down. 
They want to keep it going.

621
00:34:38,299 --> 00:34:40,121
- Whoopee!
- You did it, George, you did it.

622
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:42,276
But they got one condition, 
only one condition.

623
00:34:42,276 --> 00:34:43,994
- What's that?
- That's the best part of it.

624
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:47,405
They've appointed George here as Executive 
Secretary to take his father's place.

625
00:34:47,405 --> 00:34:48,677
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy ...

626
00:34:48,677 --> 00:34:50,439
You can keep him on. 
That's all right.

627
00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:52,403
As Secretary you can 
hire anyone you like.

628
00:34:52,403 --> 00:34:54,315
Dr. Campbell, now let's 
get this thing straight.

629
00:34:54,315 --> 00:34:55,872
I'm leaving. 
I'm leaving right now.

630
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,598
I'm going to school. 
This is my last chance.

631
00:34:57,598 --> 00:34:59,139
Uncle Billy here, he's your man.

632
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:01,767
But, George, they'll vote 
with Potter otherwise.

633
00:35:04,142 --> 00:35:06,515
I know, I know, he didn't go.

634
00:35:06,515 --> 00:35:07,596
That's right.

635
00:35:07,596 --> 00:35:12,205
Not only that, but he gave his school money 
to his brother, Harry, and sent him to college.

636
00:35:12,205 --> 00:35:13,999
Harry became a football star.

637
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:15,777
Made second team All-American.

638
00:35:15,777 --> 00:35:18,339
Yeah, but what happened to George?

639
00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:21,477
George got four years older, 
waiting for Harry to come back ...

640
00:35:21,477 --> 00:35:23,256
and take over the Building and Loan.

641
00:35:23,256 --> 00:35:25,952
Oh, there are plenty of jobs around 
for somebody that likes to travel.

642
00:35:25,952 --> 00:35:27,143
Look at this. There ...

643
00:35:27,143 --> 00:35:31,610
Venezuela oil fields — Wanted. 
Man with construction experience.

644
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:36,365
Here's the Yukon, oh, right here — 
wanted - man with engineering experience.

645
00:35:37,226 --> 00:35:39,073
There she blows.

646
00:35:39,073 --> 00:35:41,464
You know what the three most exciting 
sounds in the world are?

647
00:35:41,464 --> 00:35:43,880
- Uh-huh. 
- Breakfast is served, lunch is served, dinner ...

648
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,501
No, no, no, no!

649
00:35:45,501 --> 00:35:49,088
- Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
- Peanut?

650
00:35:49,088 --> 00:35:50,409
There's the Professor now.

651
00:35:50,409 --> 00:35:54,321
- Old Professor Phil Beta Kappa Bailey! All-American.
- Well, if it isn't old George Geographic Explorer Bailey.

652
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:56,172
What? No husky dogs? No sled?

653
00:35:56,172 --> 00:35:57,642
Uncle Billy, you haven't changed a bit.

654
00:35:57,642 --> 00:36:01,032
- Nobody ever changes here, you know that.
- Oh, am I glad to see you.

655
00:36:01,032 --> 00:36:03,305
- Say, where's mother?
- She's home, cooking the fatted calf.

656
00:36:03,305 --> 00:36:05,284
- Come on. Let's go.
- Oh, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

657
00:36:05,284 --> 00:36:08,277
George, Uncle Billy, 
I want you to meet Ruth.

658
00:36:08,277 --> 00:36:09,628
- Hello.
- How do you do.

659
00:36:09,628 --> 00:36:12,456
- Ruth Dakin.
- Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind.

660
00:36:12,456 --> 00:36:13,548
Huh?

661
00:36:13,548 --> 00:36:17,062
Well, I wired you I had a surprise. 
Here she is. Meet the wife.

662
00:36:17,062 --> 00:36:19,955
Well, what do you know — wife.

663
00:36:21,002 --> 00:36:23,826
Well, how do you do. 
Congratulations.

664
00:36:23,826 --> 00:36:25,874
What am I doing? Congratulations!

665
00:36:25,874 --> 00:36:29,760
They're married ...
why didn't you tell somebody?

666
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,237
... Oh, I can't wait 
to see Tilly's face.

667
00:36:33,237 --> 00:36:34,646
- Did you really marry him?
- Why, yes ...

668
00:36:34,646 --> 00:36:37,971
What's a pretty girl like you doing 
marrying this two-headed brother of mine?

669
00:36:37,971 --> 00:36:39,619
Well, I tell you. 
It's purely mercenary.

670
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:40,905
My father offered him a job.

671
00:36:40,905 --> 00:36:45,560
Oh, he gets you and a job? 
Well, Harry's cup runneth over.

672
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,460
Uh, George, about that job, 
Ruth spoke out of turn.

673
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,229
I never said I'd take it.

674
00:36:50,229 --> 00:36:53,098
You've been holding the bag here 
for four years, and ...

675
00:36:53,098 --> 00:36:54,740
well, I won't let you down, George.

676
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,010
I would like to ... Oh, wait a minute. 
I forgot the bags.

677
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:58,105
I'll be right back.

678
00:36:58,995 --> 00:37:03,736
It was a surprise to me. This is the 
new Mrs. Bailey, my nephew's wife.

679
00:37:03,736 --> 00:37:09,535
Old, old friends of the family.

680
00:37:09,535 --> 00:37:12,639
- Oh, of course, I've heard him speak of you.
- And I want you to tell you,

681
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:19,203
we're going to give the biggest 
party this town ever saw.

682
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,104
Here, have some popcorn.

683
00:37:22,459 --> 00:37:24,934
George, George, George, 
that's all Harry ever talks about.

684
00:37:24,934 --> 00:37:29,095
Uh, uh, uh, Ruth, uh, this, 
uh, what about this job?

685
00:37:29,095 --> 00:37:31,590
Oh, well, my father owns 
a glass factory in Buffalo.

686
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:34,050
He wants to get Harry started 
in the research business.

687
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,621
- Well, is it a good job?
- Oh, yes, very.

688
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:40,007
- Not much money, but, uh, good future, you know.
- I know.

689
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,021
Harry's a genius at research.

690
00:37:42,021 --> 00:37:45,205
- My father just fell in love with him.
- And you did, too.

691
00:38:00,351 --> 00:38:03,253
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

692
00:38:03,253 --> 00:38:07,338
I feel so good. 
I could spit in Potter's eye.

693
00:38:07,338 --> 00:38:10,239
I think I will. 
I think I will.

694
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:12,539
What did you say? Huh?

695
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:14,794
Oh, maybe I'd better go home.

696
00:38:14,794 --> 00:38:16,706
Where's my hat? Where's my ...

697
00:38:16,706 --> 00:38:20,354
Oh! Oh, thank you, George, 
which is mine?

698
00:38:20,354 --> 00:38:23,693
- The middle one.
- Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy.

699
00:38:23,693 --> 00:38:27,447
Now, look, if you'll point me in the right 
direction ... would you do that, George?

700
00:38:27,447 --> 00:38:31,197
- Right down here.
- Oh ... Old Building and Loan pal, huh ...

701
00:38:31,197 --> 00:38:34,274
Now you just turn this way and 
go right straight down there.

702
00:38:34,274 --> 00:38:35,576
That way, huh?

703
00:38:35,576 --> 00:38:40,424
♪ My Wild Irish rose ... ♪

704
00:38:43,241 --> 00:38:46,515
I'm all right. I'm all right.

706
00:39:28,795 --> 00:39:29,832
Hello, Mom.

707
00:39:32,343 --> 00:39:33,568
That's for nothing.

708
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:37,801
- How do you like her?
- Oh, she's swell.

709
00:39:37,801 --> 00:39:40,551
Looks like she can 
keep Harry on his toes.

710
00:39:40,551 --> 00:39:42,875
Keep him out of Bedford Falls anyway.

711
00:39:45,029 --> 00:39:47,775
Did you know that 
Mary Hatch is back from school?

712
00:39:47,775 --> 00:39:50,208
- Uh-huh.
- Came back three days ago.

713
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:51,952
Hmmm ...

714
00:39:51,952 --> 00:39:55,586
- Nice girl, Mary.
- Hmmm.

715
00:39:55,586 --> 00:39:58,607
Kind that will help you 
find the answers, George.

716
00:39:58,607 --> 00:40:01,729
- Hmmm ...
- Oh, stop that grunting.

717
00:40:01,729 --> 00:40:03,029
Hmmm.

718
00:40:03,029 --> 00:40:06,489
Can you give me one good reason 
why you shouldn't call on Mary?

719
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:08,203
- Sure — Sam Wainwright.
- Hmmm?

720
00:40:08,203 --> 00:40:11,551
- Yes, Sam's crazy about Mary.
- Well, she's not crazy about him.

721
00:40:11,551 --> 00:40:12,555
Well, how do you know?

722
00:40:12,555 --> 00:40:14,111
- Well, did she discuss it with you?
- No.

723
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:16,972
- Well then, how do you know?
- Well, I've got eyes, haven't I?

724
00:40:16,972 --> 00:40:20,231
Why, she lights up like a firefly 
whenever you're around.

725
00:40:20,231 --> 00:40:21,429
Oh ...

726
00:40:21,429 --> 00:40:25,742
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in 
New York and you're here in Bedford Falls.

727
00:40:25,742 --> 00:40:28,473
And all's fair in love and war.

728
00:40:28,473 --> 00:40:30,003
Well, I don't know about war.

729
00:40:33,842 --> 00:40:37,646
Mother of mine, I can see right through 
you, right to your back collar button ...

730
00:40:37,646 --> 00:40:39,913
- trying to get rid of me, huh?
- Uh-huh.

731
00:40:42,476 --> 00:40:44,524
Well, here's your hat, 
what's your hurry.

732
00:40:45,606 --> 00:40:48,443
All right, Mother, 
Old Building and Loan pal,

733
00:40:48,443 --> 00:40:51,585
I think I'll go out and find the girl 
and do a little passionate necking.

734
00:40:51,585 --> 00:40:53,133
Oh, George ...

735
00:40:53,133 --> 00:40:56,266
Now if you'll just point me 
in the right direction ...

736
00:40:57,942 --> 00:40:59,181
this direction?

737
00:41:06,408 --> 00:41:07,879
Good night, Mrs. Bailey.

738
00:41:19,328 --> 00:41:21,971
- Excuse me ...
- Now, wait a minute.

739
00:41:21,971 --> 00:41:24,301
I think I got a date.

740
00:41:24,301 --> 00:41:26,883
But uh, stick around, fellows, 
just in case, huh?

741
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:29,944
We'll wait for you, baby.

742
00:41:32,097 --> 00:41:34,712
- Hello, George-Porgie!
- What?

743
00:41:34,712 --> 00:41:37,970
- Hey, uh ... What gives?
- Nothing.

744
00:41:38,804 --> 00:41:43,208
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I'm ... probably end up down at the library.

745
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:47,459
Georgie, don't you ever get tired of 
just reading about things?

746
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:52,868
- Yes. What are you doing tonight?
- Not a thing.

747
00:41:53,438 --> 00:41:55,262
Are you game, Violet? 
Let's make a night of it.

748
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,518
Oh, I'd love it, Georgie. 
What'll we do?

749
00:41:57,518 --> 00:42:00,881
Let's go out in the fields and take off 
our shoes, and walk through the grass.

750
00:42:00,881 --> 00:42:01,929
Huh?

751
00:42:01,929 --> 00:42:04,983
Then we can to up to the falls. 
It's beautiful up there in the moonlight,

752
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:07,219
and there's a green pool up there,

753
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:09,799
and we can, uh, s-swim in it.

754
00:42:09,799 --> 00:42:11,813
Then we can climb Mt. Bedford,

755
00:42:11,813 --> 00:42:14,781
and smell the pines and watch 
the sunrise against the peaks,

756
00:42:14,781 --> 00:42:16,270
and we'll stay up there 
the whole night,

757
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:18,286
and everybody'll be talking 
and there'll be a terrific scandal ...

758
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,191
Georgie, have you gone crazy?

759
00:42:20,191 --> 00:42:22,194
Walk in the grass in my bare feet?

760
00:42:23,515 --> 00:42:26,333
- Why, it's ten miles up to Mt. Bedford.
- Shhh ...

761
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:29,723
- You think just because you ...
- O-O-Okay, just forget about the whole thing.

762
00:42:47,726 --> 00:42:50,404
What are you doing, picketing?

763
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:52,173
Hello, Mary.

764
00:42:52,173 --> 00:42:54,412
I just happened to be passing by.

765
00:42:54,412 --> 00:42:56,751
Yes, so I noticed.

766
00:42:56,751 --> 00:42:59,134
- Have you made up your mind?
- How's that?

767
00:42:59,134 --> 00:43:00,687
Have you made up your mind?

768
00:43:00,687 --> 00:43:03,909
- About what?
- About coming in.

769
00:43:03,909 --> 00:43:07,629
Your mother just phoned and said you 
were on your way over to pay me a visit.

770
00:43:07,629 --> 00:43:10,327
My mother just called you? 
Well, how did she know?

771
00:43:10,327 --> 00:43:12,159
- Didn't you tell her?
- I didn't tell anybody.

772
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:15,270
I just went for a walk and happened 
to be passing by, idiot.

773
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:20,851
What do you ... 
went for a walk. That's all.

774
00:43:22,153 --> 00:43:24,516
- I'll be downstairs, mother.
- All right, dear.

775
00:43:46,918 --> 00:43:49,666
Well, are you coming in 
or aren't you?

776
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:55,216
Well, I'll come in for a minute. 
But I ...

777
00:44:07,272 --> 00:44:10,205
I didn't tell anybody 
I was coming over here, you know.

778
00:44:12,189 --> 00:44:15,904
- When did you get back?
- Tuesday.

779
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:17,802
Where'd you get that dress?

780
00:44:17,802 --> 00:44:20,234
- Do you like it?
- It's all right.

781
00:44:25,211 --> 00:44:28,958
I thought you'd go back to New York like 
Sam and Angie, and the rest of them.

782
00:44:30,236 --> 00:44:33,462
Oh, oh, I worked there 
a couple of vacations. But ...

783
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,513
I don't know ... 
I — I guess I was homesick.

784
00:44:35,513 --> 00:44:38,907
Homesick? For Bedford Falls?

785
00:44:38,907 --> 00:44:45,686
Yes, and my family, and ... 
Oh, everything.

786
00:44:45,686 --> 00:44:47,590
Would you like to sit down?

787
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:49,164
All right, for a minute.

788
00:44:50,297 --> 00:44:54,457
I — I still can't understand it though. 
You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.

789
00:44:54,457 --> 00:44:55,671
Would you rather leave?

790
00:44:55,671 --> 00:44:57,604
No, I don't want to be rude.

791
00:44:57,604 --> 00:44:59,405
Well, then sit down.

792
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,546
What's this?

793
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:05,227
Some joke, huh?

794
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:15,874
Well, I see it still smells 
like pine needles around here.

795
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:17,934
Thank you.

796
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:27,231
And dance by the ...

797
00:45:27,231 --> 00:45:28,361
What's the matter?

798
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,599
Oh, oh, yeah ... yeah ...

799
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:35,422
Well, I ...

800
00:45:35,422 --> 00:45:37,794
It was nice about your brother 
Harry, and Ruth, isn't it?

801
00:45:37,794 --> 00:45:40,286
Oh ... yeah, yeah. That's all right.

802
00:45:40,286 --> 00:45:41,471
Don't you like her?

803
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:43,752
Well, of course, I like her. 
She's a peach.

804
00:45:45,089 --> 00:45:49,181
Oh, it's just marriage in general 
you're not enthusiastic about, huh?

805
00:45:49,181 --> 00:45:53,735
No. Uh, marriage is all right 
for Harry and Marty and Sam and you.

806
00:45:53,735 --> 00:45:55,530
Mary! Mary!

807
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:57,102
Who's down there with you?

808
00:45:57,102 --> 00:45:59,069
It's George Bailey, Mother.

809
00:45:59,069 --> 00:46:01,987
George Bailey?! What's he want?

810
00:46:01,987 --> 00:46:03,886
I don't know.

811
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:04,999
What do you want?

812
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:08,020
Me?

813
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:10,595
Not a thing. 
I — I just came in to get warm.

814
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:16,438
He's making violent love to me, Mother.

815
00:46:16,438 --> 00:46:19,678
You tell him to go right back home, 
and don't you leave the house, either.

816
00:46:19,678 --> 00:46:22,833
Sam Wainwright promised to call you 
from New York tonight.

817
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:24,407
But your mother needn't ...

818
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:26,017
You know I — I didn't come here to ...

819
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:27,404
What did you come here for then?

820
00:46:27,404 --> 00:46:28,603
I don't know. You tell me.

821
00:46:28,603 --> 00:46:30,333
You're supposed to be the one 
that has all the answers.

822
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:32,134
- You tell me.
- Why don't you go home?

823
00:46:32,134 --> 00:46:35,037
That's where I'm going. I don't know 
why I came here in the first place.

824
00:46:35,037 --> 00:46:36,525
- Good night.
- Good night!

825
00:46:36,525 --> 00:46:38,105
Mary! Mary!

826
00:46:38,105 --> 00:46:41,069
- The telephone. It's Sam!
- I'll get it.

827
00:46:41,069 --> 00:46:43,370
Whatever were you doing 
that you couldn't hear?

828
00:46:52,832 --> 00:46:55,240
Mary, he's waiting!

829
00:46:58,635 --> 00:46:59,892
Hello.

830
00:47:01,587 --> 00:47:03,035
I forgot my hat.

831
00:47:04,858 --> 00:47:08,402
Hee-haw! Hello, Sam, how are you?

832
00:47:08,402 --> 00:47:11,355
Aw, I'm great. Gee, it's good 
to hear your voice again.

833
00:47:11,355 --> 00:47:15,166
Oh, well, that's awfully 
sweet of you, Sam.

834
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:18,594
There's an old friend of yours here. 
George Bailey.

835
00:47:18,594 --> 00:47:20,578
You mean old moss-back George?

836
00:47:20,578 --> 00:47:23,351
Yes. Old moss-back George.

837
00:47:23,351 --> 00:47:25,215
Hee-haw! Put him on.

838
00:47:25,215 --> 00:47:27,514
W-Wait just a minute. 
I — I'll call him. George!

839
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:29,782
He doesn't want to speak to George, 
you idiot!

840
00:47:29,782 --> 00:47:31,053
He does so. He asked for him.

841
00:47:31,053 --> 00:47:35,366
Geo-George! 
George, Sam wants to speak to you.

842
00:47:39,801 --> 00:47:42,911
- Hi, Sam.
- Well, George Baileyoffski!

843
00:47:42,911 --> 00:47:44,638
Hey, a fine pal you are.

844
00:47:44,638 --> 00:47:46,608
What're you trying to do? 
Steal my girl?

845
00:47:46,608 --> 00:47:49,468
W-W-What do you mean? Nobody's 
trying to steal anybody's girl.

846
00:47:49,468 --> 00:47:51,464
H-Here ... here's Mary.

847
00:47:51,464 --> 00:47:53,038
No, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute. 
I want to talk to both of you.

848
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:55,082
- Here to you.
- Tell Mary to get on the extension.

849
00:47:55,082 --> 00:47:57,323
- You tell him.
- Mother's on the extension. We ...

850
00:47:57,323 --> 00:47:58,636
I am not!

851
00:47:59,327 --> 00:48:01,914
We can both hear. Come here.

852
00:48:01,914 --> 00:48:04,032
We-We're listening, Sam.

853
00:48:04,032 --> 00:48:07,637
Well look, I have a big deal coming 
up that's going to make us all rich.

854
00:48:07,637 --> 00:48:10,655
George, you remember that night 
in Martini's Bar when, eh,

855
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:13,754
you told me you read someplace 
about making plastics out of soybeans?

856
00:48:13,754 --> 00:48:15,006
Jelly beans?

857
00:48:15,006 --> 00:48:16,047
Shut up, will you?

858
00:48:16,047 --> 00:48:20,002
Do you remember out of jelly —
... out of soybeans?

859
00:48:20,002 --> 00:48:23,192
Huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah ...
soybeans. Yeah.

860
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:25,807
Well, listen. 
Dad snapped up the idea.

861
00:48:25,807 --> 00:48:28,067
And he's going to build a factory 
outside of Rochester.

862
00:48:28,067 --> 00:48:29,420
How do you like that?

863
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:35,088
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?

864
00:48:35,088 --> 00:48:37,971
Well, why not? 
Can you think of anything better?

865
00:48:37,971 --> 00:48:39,713
Oh, I don't know ... 
It's just ...

866
00:48:39,713 --> 00:48:41,388
Why not right here?

867
00:48:41,388 --> 00:48:44,680
Y-You remember that ...
that old tool and machinery works?

868
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,070
W-Well, you tell your father 
he can get that for a song.

869
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:48,353
And all the labor he wants, too.

870
00:48:48,353 --> 00:48:51,185
Half the town was thrown out 
of work when they closed down.

871
00:48:51,185 --> 00:48:53,424
Is that so? Well, I'll tell him.

872
00:48:53,424 --> 00:48:54,964
Hey, that sounds great.

873
00:48:54,964 --> 00:48:56,793
Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through.

874
00:48:56,793 --> 00:48:58,146
Now here's the point,

875
00:48:58,146 --> 00:49:02,646
Mary ... Mary, you're in on this, too. 
Now listen, have you got any money?

876
00:49:05,158 --> 00:49:08,016
- Money? Yeah ... well, a little.
- Well now, listen.

877
00:49:08,016 --> 00:49:11,822
I want you to put every cent 
you've got into our stock, you hear?

878
00:49:11,822 --> 00:49:14,518
And George, I may have a job for you,

879
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:17,842
that is, unless you're still married 
to that broken-down Building and Loan.

880
00:49:19,111 --> 00:49:22,947
Well, this is the biggest thing since radio. 
And I'm letting you in on the ground floor.

881
00:49:22,947 --> 00:49:25,241
Oh, Mary ... Mary ...

882
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:29,513
Well, I — I'm here.

883
00:49:29,513 --> 00:49:33,348
Uh, would you tell that guy I'm giving 
him the chance of a lifetime, you hear?

884
00:49:33,348 --> 00:49:35,287
The chance of a lifetime.

885
00:49:38,904 --> 00:49:41,803
H-He says it's the 
chance of a lifetime.

886
00:49:44,798 --> 00:49:46,526
Now you listen to me.

887
00:49:46,526 --> 00:49:49,624
I don't want any plastics. 
I don't want any ground floors.

888
00:49:49,624 --> 00:49:53,164
And I don't want to get married 
ever to anyone. You understand that?

889
00:49:53,164 --> 00:49:55,383
I want to do what I want to do.

890
00:49:55,383 --> 00:49:57,703
And you're ... and you're ...

891
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:02,564
- Oh, Mary ... Mary ...
- George ... George ... George ...

892
00:50:04,803 --> 00:50:11,016
Mary ... Would you? Would you ...

893
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:17,284
Here they come! Here they come!

894
00:50:38,859 --> 00:50:40,059
Goodbye.

895
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:58,102
First Harry. Now George.

896
00:50:58,102 --> 00:51:00,372
Annie, we're just two old maids now.

897
00:51:00,372 --> 00:51:02,514
You speak for yourself, Mrs. B.

898
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:08,573
If either of you two see a stranger 
around here, it's me.

899
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:13,285
Hey, look! 
There's somebody driving this cab.

900
00:51:13,285 --> 00:51:15,245
Bert the cop sent this over.

901
00:51:15,245 --> 00:51:17,512
He said to float away to Happy Land 
on the bubbles.

902
00:51:17,512 --> 00:51:20,128
- Oh, look at this. Old Bert. Champagne!
- Good old Bert.

903
00:51:20,128 --> 00:51:23,165
By the way, where are you two going 
on this here now honeymoon?

904
00:51:23,165 --> 00:51:24,535
Where are we going?

905
00:51:24,535 --> 00:51:26,516
Look at this. 
There's the kitty, Ernie.

906
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:28,308
Here, come on, count it, Mary.

907
00:51:28,308 --> 00:51:30,136
I feel like a bootlegger's wife. 
Look!

908
00:51:30,136 --> 00:51:32,389
You know what we're going to do? 
We're going to shoot the works.

909
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,694
A whole week in New York. 
A whole week in Bermuda.

910
00:51:34,694 --> 00:51:37,375
The highest hotels, 
the oldest champagne,

911
00:51:37,375 --> 00:51:41,943
the richest caviar, the hottest music, 
and the prettiest wife!

912
00:51:41,943 --> 00:51:43,495
Wow! 
That does it! Then what?

913
00:51:43,495 --> 00:51:47,879
- Then what, honey? 
- After that, who cares?

914
00:51:47,879 --> 00:51:50,193
That does it, 
come here, come here, come here!

915
00:51:52,908 --> 00:51:57,031
Don't look now, but there's something funny 
going on over there at the bank, George.

916
00:51:57,031 --> 00:52:00,734
I've never really seen one, but that's 
got all the earmarks of being a run.

917
00:52:08,329 --> 00:52:11,487
Hey, Ernie, if you got any money 
in the bank, you better hurry.

918
00:52:11,487 --> 00:52:14,235
- George, let's not stop. Let's go.
- Just a minute, dear.

919
00:52:16,746 --> 00:52:19,335
- Oh-oh ...
- Please, let's not stop, George.

920
00:52:19,335 --> 00:52:20,686
I'll be back in a minute, Mary.

921
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,494
Well, hello, everybody. 
Mrs. Thompson, how are you?

922
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:42,856
Charlie? 
What's the matter here, can't you get in?

923
00:53:00,662 --> 00:53:02,779
What is this, Uncle Billy? 
A holiday?

924
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,463
George ...

925
00:53:05,204 --> 00:53:06,656
Come on in, everybody. 
That's right.

926
00:53:07,687 --> 00:53:08,982
Just come on in.

927
00:53:12,836 --> 00:53:14,444
Now look, 
why don't you all sit down?

928
00:53:14,444 --> 00:53:16,251
There are a lot of seats over there.

929
00:53:17,691 --> 00:53:19,110
Just make yourself at home.

930
00:53:21,145 --> 00:53:23,262
George, can I see you a minute?

931
00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:26,360
- Why didn't you call me?
- I just did, but they said you left.

932
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,019
This is a pickle, George. 
This is a pickle.

933
00:53:28,019 --> 00:53:29,504
All right now, what happened? 
How did it start?

934
00:53:29,504 --> 00:53:32,048
Well, how does a thing like this ever start? 
All I know is the bank called our loan.

935
00:53:32,048 --> 00:53:33,378
- When?
- About an hour ago.

936
00:53:33,378 --> 00:53:35,409
- I had to hand over all our cash.
- All of it?

937
00:53:35,409 --> 00:53:37,088
Every cent of it 
and it still was less than we owe.

938
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,919
Holy mackerel!

939
00:53:38,919 --> 00:53:42,718
And then I got scared, George, 
and closed the doors. I — I — I ...

940
00:53:44,959 --> 00:53:46,584
The whole town's gone crazy.

941
00:53:46,584 --> 00:53:48,124
Yes, h-hello?

942
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:50,291
George, it's Potter.

943
00:53:54,078 --> 00:53:55,634
- Hello?
- George,

944
00:53:55,634 --> 00:54:01,127
there is a rumor around town that you've 
closed your doors. Is that true?

945
00:54:01,127 --> 00:54:05,246
Oh, well, I'm very glad to hear that. 
George, are you all right?

946
00:54:05,246 --> 00:54:08,363
- Do you need any police?
- Police? What's for?

947
00:54:08,363 --> 00:54:12,627
Well, mobs get pretty ugly 
sometimes, you know.

948
00:54:12,627 --> 00:54:17,468
George, I'm going all out 
to help in this crisis.

949
00:54:17,468 --> 00:54:22,919
I've just guaranteed the bank 
sufficient funds to meet their needs.

950
00:54:22,919 --> 00:54:26,223
They'll close up for a week 
and then reopen.

951
00:54:27,016 --> 00:54:28,315
He just took over the bank.

952
00:54:29,158 --> 00:54:34,745
I may lose a fortune, but I'm 
willing to guarantee your people too.

953
00:54:34,745 --> 00:54:39,923
Just tell them to bring their shares over here, 
and I will pay fifty cents on the dollar.

954
00:54:39,923 --> 00:54:42,178
Aw, you never miss a trick, 
do you, Potter?

955
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:43,292
Well, you're gonna miss this one.

956
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:47,242
If you close your doors before 
six P.M., you will never reopen.

957
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:59,150
George, was it a nice wedding? 
Gosh, I wanted to be there.

958
00:55:00,011 --> 00:55:01,124
Yeah ...

959
00:55:02,988 --> 00:55:04,983
You can take this one off now.

960
00:55:13,703 --> 00:55:19,159
Now, just remember that this thing 
isn't as black as it appears.

961
00:55:28,712 --> 00:55:30,525
I have some news for you folks.

962
00:55:30,525 --> 00:55:33,816
I was just talking to old man Potter and 
he's guaranteed cash payments at the bank.

963
00:55:33,816 --> 00:55:35,439
The bank's going to reopen next week.

964
00:55:35,439 --> 00:55:37,354
But, George, I got my money here.

965
00:55:37,354 --> 00:55:39,148
Did he guarantee this place?

966
00:55:39,148 --> 00:55:40,935
Well, no, Charlie. 
I didn't even ask him.

967
00:55:40,935 --> 00:55:43,611
- We don't need Potter over here.
- I'll take mine now.

968
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:48,826
No, but you — you ... you're 
thinking of this place all wrong.

969
00:55:48,826 --> 00:55:50,674
As if I had the money back in a safe.

970
00:55:50,674 --> 00:55:52,741
The, the money's not here.

971
00:55:52,741 --> 00:55:55,267
Well, your money's in Joe's house ...
that's right next to yours.

972
00:55:55,267 --> 00:55:59,238
And in the Kennedy House, and Mrs. Macklin's 
house, and, and a hundred others.

973
00:55:59,238 --> 00:56:01,078
Why, you're lending them 
the money to build,

974
00:56:01,078 --> 00:56:02,809
and then, they're going to pay it 
back to you as best they can.

975
00:56:02,809 --> 00:56:04,604
Now what are you going to do? 
Foreclose on them?

976
00:56:04,604 --> 00:56:07,447
I got two hundred and 
forty-two dollars in here ...

977
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:10,907
and two hundred and forty-two dollars 
isn't going to break anybody.

978
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,688
Okay, Tom. All right. 
Here you are. You sign this.

979
00:56:15,688 --> 00:56:18,316
- You'll get your money in sixty days.
- Sixty days?

980
00:56:18,316 --> 00:56:20,488
Well, now that's what you agreed 
to when you bought you shares.

981
00:56:20,488 --> 00:56:22,613
- Tom ...Tom ... Did you get your money?
- No.

982
00:56:22,613 --> 00:56:26,424
Well, I did. Old man Potter'll pay fifty cents 
on the dollar for every share you got.

983
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:29,168
- Fifty cents on the dollar!
- Yes, cash!

984
00:56:29,168 --> 00:56:31,844
- Well, what do you say?
- Now, Tom,

985
00:56:31,844 --> 00:56:33,557
you have to stick to your original agreement.

986
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:36,081
- Now give us sixty days on this.
- Okay, Randall.

987
00:56:36,081 --> 00:56:38,918
- Are you going to go to Potter's?
- Better get half than nothing.

988
00:56:39,325 --> 00:56:41,923
Tom! Tom!

989
00:56:41,923 --> 00:56:44,167
Randall, now wait a minute, wait ...

990
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:45,979
now listen ... now listen to me.

991
00:56:45,979 --> 00:56:48,369
I — I beg of you not to do this thing.

992
00:56:48,369 --> 00:56:50,093
If Potter gets ahold 
of this Building and Loan,

993
00:56:50,093 --> 00:56:52,069
there'll never be another decent 
house built in this town.

994
00:56:52,069 --> 00:56:54,661
He's already got charge of the bank. 
He's got the bus line.

995
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,948
He's got the department stores. 
And now he's after us.

996
00:56:56,948 --> 00:56:58,539
Why? Well, it's very simple.

997
00:56:58,539 --> 00:57:01,081
Because we're cutting in on 
his business, that's why.

998
00:57:01,081 --> 00:57:03,125
And because he wants to keep 
you living in his slums ...

999
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:05,205
and paying the kind of rent he decides.

1000
00:57:05,205 --> 00:57:08,019
Joe, you had one of those Potter houses, 
didn't you? Well, have you forgotten?

1001
00:57:08,019 --> 00:57:10,852
Have you forgotten what he charged 
for that broken-down shack?

1002
00:57:10,852 --> 00:57:13,855
Here, Ed. You know, you remember last 
year when things weren't going so well,

1003
00:57:13,855 --> 00:57:15,173
you couldn't make your payments.

1004
00:57:15,173 --> 00:57:18,276
You didn't lose your house, did you? 
Do you think Potter would have let you keep it?

1005
00:57:18,276 --> 00:57:21,346
Ca-Can't you understand 
what's happening here?

1006
00:57:21,346 --> 00:57:23,061
Don't you see what's happening?

1007
00:57:23,061 --> 00:57:25,229
Potter isn't selling. 
Potter's buying.

1008
00:57:25,229 --> 00:57:28,165
And why? Because we're panicky 
and he's not. That's why.

1009
00:57:28,165 --> 00:57:29,311
He's picking up some bargains.

1010
00:57:29,311 --> 00:57:31,942
Now, We-We can get 
through this thing all right.

1011
00:57:31,942 --> 00:57:35,301
We — We've got to stick together, though. 
We've got to have faith in each other.

1012
00:57:35,301 --> 00:57:38,508
But my husband hasn't worked in 
over a year and I need money.

1013
00:57:38,508 --> 00:57:41,876
- How am I going to live until the bank opens?
- I got doctor bills to pay.

1014
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:44,517
- I need cash.
- I can't feed my kids on faith.

1015
00:57:44,517 --> 00:57:46,608
How much do you need?

1016
00:57:46,608 --> 00:57:49,928
Hey! I got two thousand dollars.

1017
00:57:50,824 --> 00:57:53,403
Here's two thousand dollars. This'll 
tide us over until the bank reopens.

1018
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:54,483
All right, 
Tom, how much do you need?

1019
00:57:54,483 --> 00:57:56,108
Two hundred and forty-two dollars.

1020
00:57:56,108 --> 00:57:58,530
Aw, Tom, just enough to tide you over 
till the bank reopens.

1021
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:01,252
I'll take 
two hundred and forty-two dollars.

1022
00:58:03,661 --> 00:58:05,472
- There you are.
- That'll close my account.

1023
00:58:05,472 --> 00:58:07,922
Your account's still here. 
That's a loan.

1024
00:58:07,922 --> 00:58:09,667
Okay. All right, Ed?

1025
00:58:09,667 --> 00:58:12,010
- I got 300 dollars here, George.
- Alright, now, Ed ...

1026
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:15,046
wh-wh-what'll it take till the 
bank opens? What do you need?

1027
00:58:15,046 --> 00:58:19,301
- Well, I — I suppose twenty dollars.
- Twenty dollars. Now you're talking.

1028
00:58:19,301 --> 00:58:20,499
Fine. Thanks, Ed.

1029
00:58:20,499 --> 00:58:22,123
All right now, Mrs. Thompson, 
how much do you want?

1030
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:24,019
- But it's your own money, George.
- Never mind about that.

1031
00:58:24,019 --> 00:58:26,426
- How much do you want?
- I can get along with twenty, all right.

1032
00:58:26,426 --> 00:58:28,436
- Twenty dollars.
- And I'll sign a paper.

1033
00:58:28,436 --> 00:58:29,568
You don't have to sign anything.

1034
00:58:29,568 --> 00:58:31,090
I know you — you'll pay it when you can.

1035
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,326
That's okay. All right, Mrs. Davis?

1036
00:58:33,326 --> 00:58:37,451
- Could I have 17.50?
- Seven ...

1037
00:58:37,451 --> 00:58:40,502
Bless your heart, of course you 
can have it. You got fifty cents?

1038
00:58:40,502 --> 00:58:41,948
- Seven ...
- We're going to make it, George.

1039
00:58:41,948 --> 00:58:45,780
- They'll never close us up today!
- Six, five, four,

1040
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:49,064
three, two, one ...

1041
00:58:49,064 --> 00:58:50,418
Bingo!

1042
00:58:50,418 --> 00:58:52,640
We made it. Close the door, Ernie. 
We made it. Look.

1043
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,148
Look, we're still in business. 
We're still got two bucks left.

1044
00:58:55,148 --> 00:58:56,890
Well, look, let's have some of that. 
Let's celebrate, huh.

1045
00:58:56,890 --> 00:58:58,491
G-Get some glasses, Tilly.

1046
00:58:58,491 --> 00:59:00,353
Well, a couple of financial wizards.

1047
00:59:00,353 --> 00:59:02,007
Those Rockefellers.

1048
00:59:02,007 --> 00:59:04,413
Get a tray for these two great 
big important simoleans here.

1049
00:59:04,413 --> 00:59:06,072
We'll save them for seed. 
A toast.

1050
00:59:06,072 --> 00:59:09,493
A toast! A toast to Mama Dollar 
and to Papa Dollar,

1051
00:59:09,493 --> 00:59:11,751
and if you want to keep this 
old Building and Loan in business,

1052
00:59:11,751 --> 00:59:14,098
- you better have a family real quick.
- I wish they were rabbits.

1053
00:59:14,098 --> 00:59:15,424
I wish they were, too.

1054
00:59:16,568 --> 00:59:18,930
Okay, let's put them in safe 
and see what happens.

1055
00:59:28,223 --> 00:59:31,733
- Folks, folks, wedding cigars!
- Oh-oh ... wedding!

1056
00:59:31,733 --> 00:59:35,322
Holy mackerel, I'm married! 
Where's Mary? Mary ...

1057
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:36,399
Well, poor Mary.

1058
00:59:36,399 --> 00:59:38,483
Look, I've got a train to catch. 
Well, the train's gone.

1059
00:59:38,483 --> 00:59:41,110
I wonder if Ernie's still 
here with his taxicab?

1060
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,567
George, there's a call for you.

1061
00:59:43,567 --> 00:59:46,390
Look, will you get my wife on the phone? 
She's probably over at her mother's.

1062
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:48,963
- Mrs. Bailey is on the phone.
- I don't want Mrs. Bailey.

1063
00:59:48,963 --> 00:59:52,133
I want my wife. Mrs. Bailey! 
Mrs ... oh, that's my wife.

1064
00:59:52,133 --> 00:59:54,158
Here, I'll take it in here.

1065
00:59:54,158 --> 00:59:57,687
Mary! Hello. Listen, dear. 
I'm sorry ...

1066
00:59:57,687 --> 01:00:02,135
What? Come home? What home?

1067
01:00:02,135 --> 01:00:04,341
Three-twenty Sycamore? 
Well, what ...

1068
01:00:04,341 --> 01:00:09,315
whose home is that? 
The Waldorf Hotel, huh?

1069
01:00:19,487 --> 01:00:22,317
Hey, this is the company's posters, 
and the company won't like this.

1070
01:00:22,317 --> 01:00:24,514
How would you like to get 
a ticket next week?

1071
01:00:24,514 --> 01:00:27,447
- Haven't you any romance in you?
- Sure I have, but I got rid of it.

1072
01:00:27,447 --> 01:00:28,595
Liver pills!

1073
01:00:28,595 --> 01:00:31,424
Who wants to see 
liver pills on their honeymoon?

1074
01:00:31,424 --> 01:00:35,397
What we want is romantic places, beautiful 
places ... places George wants to go.

1075
01:00:36,887 --> 01:00:39,997
- Hey, Bert. Here he comes.
- Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.

1076
01:00:39,997 --> 01:00:41,922
- Who?
- The groom, idiot.

1077
01:00:41,922 --> 01:00:43,869
This is their honeymoon. 
Come on. Get that ladder.

1078
01:00:43,869 --> 01:00:45,193
What are they — ducks?

1079
01:00:48,315 --> 01:00:50,749
- Get that ladder up here.
- All right, all right.

1080
01:00:50,749 --> 01:00:53,151
- Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying.

1081
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:05,211
Hiya ... Geo ... 
uh ... good evening, sir.

1082
01:01:07,381 --> 01:01:09,229
Entree, Monsieur.

1083
01:01:10,804 --> 01:01:18,126
- Entree.

- Rent?

1101
01:03:54,912 --> 01:03:57,440
- You hear what he say, Mr. Bailey?
- What's that?

1102
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,406
I own the house.

1103
01:03:59,406 --> 01:04:02,835
Me, Giuseppe Martini, 
I own my own house.

1104
01:04:02,835 --> 01:04:06,248
No more we live like pigs 
in this Potter's Field.

1105
01:04:06,248 --> 01:04:07,698
Hurry, Marie!

1106
01:04:07,698 --> 01:04:09,121
Come on ... Bring the baby.

1107
01:04:09,977 --> 01:04:11,878
This is like a dream!

1108
01:04:11,878 --> 01:04:13,076
I'll take the kids in the car.

1109
01:04:13,076 --> 01:04:14,998
Oh, thank you, Mr. Bailey.

1110
01:04:14,998 --> 01:04:17,032
All right, kids. Here.

1111
01:04:17,032 --> 01:04:18,129
Get in here.

1112
01:04:18,129 --> 01:04:20,062
Now get right up on the seat there.

1113
01:04:22,305 --> 01:04:24,185
Get the ... get the dog!

1114
01:04:26,238 --> 01:04:27,997
You've got a goat too!

1115
01:04:29,316 --> 01:04:35,003
- All right. Goodbye.
- Goodbye, everybody!

1116
01:04:37,683 --> 01:04:38,712
All in.

1117
01:04:57,471 --> 01:04:59,587
Mr. and Mrs. Martini, welcome home.

1118
01:05:00,377 --> 01:05:02,678
Good old George. 
He's always making a speech.

1119
01:05:03,947 --> 01:05:05,780
Hee-haw!

1120
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:09,777
- Sam Wainwright!
- Oh, who cares!

1121
01:05:09,777 --> 01:05:12,817
Bread! That this house 
may never know hunger.

1122
01:05:13,594 --> 01:05:17,091
Salt! That life may 
always have flavor!

1123
01:05:17,091 --> 01:05:20,875
And wine!! That joy and 
prosperity may reign forever.

1124
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,809
Enter the Martini castle!

1125
01:05:24,537 --> 01:05:26,944
Look, Mr. Potter, 
it's no skin off my nose.

1126
01:05:26,944 --> 01:05:28,808
I'm just your little rent collector.

1127
01:05:28,808 --> 01:05:32,637
But you can't laugh off this 
Bailey Park anymore. Look at it.

1128
01:05:33,941 --> 01:05:35,733
Congressman Black is here to see you.

1129
01:05:35,733 --> 01:05:38,890
Oh, tell the congressman to wait.
Go on.

1130
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:41,773
Fifteen years ago, a half-dozen 
houses stuck here and there.

1131
01:05:41,773 --> 01:05:44,099
There's the old cemetery, squirrels, 
buttercups, daisies.

1132
01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:45,905
I used to hunt rabbits there myself.

1133
01:05:47,312 --> 01:05:48,716
Look at it today.

1134
01:05:48,716 --> 01:05:51,720
Dozens of the prettiest 
little homes you ever saw.

1135
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:54,993
Ninety per cent owned by suckers 
who used to pay rent to you!

1136
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:58,472
Your Potter's Field, my dear 
Mr. Employer, is becoming just that.

1137
01:05:58,472 --> 01:06:02,016
And are the local yokels making with 
those David and Goliath wisecracks.

1138
01:06:02,016 --> 01:06:03,743
Oh, they are, are they?

1139
01:06:03,743 --> 01:06:06,625
Even though they know the Baileys 
never made a dime out of it.

1140
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:07,909
You know very well why,

1141
01:06:07,909 --> 01:06:09,313
the Baileys were all chumps.

1142
01:06:09,313 --> 01:06:13,487
Every one of these homes is worth twice 
what it cost the Building and Loan to build.

1143
01:06:13,487 --> 01:06:16,181
- If I were you, Mr. Potter ...
- Well, you are not me.

1144
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:19,552
As I say, it's no skin off my nose.

1145
01:06:22,829 --> 01:06:27,208
But one of these days this bright young man 
is going to be asking George Bailey for a job.

1146
01:06:29,905 --> 01:06:33,483
The Bailey family has been a boil 
on my neck long enough.

1147
01:06:33,483 --> 01:06:34,746
- Yes, sir?
- Come in here.

1148
01:06:35,451 --> 01:06:37,760
We just stopped in town to take a 
look at the new factory, and then ...

1149
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,779
- we're going to drive on down to Florida.
- Oh ...

1150
01:06:39,779 --> 01:06:42,313
- Why don't you have your friends join us?
- Why, sure.

1151
01:06:42,313 --> 01:06:45,230
Hey, why don't you kids drive down 
with us, huh?

1152
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:48,099
Oh, I'm afraid 
I couldn't get away, Sam.

1153
01:06:48,099 --> 01:06:50,165
Still got the nose 
to the old grindstone, eh?

1154
01:06:50,165 --> 01:06:55,121
Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground 
floor in plastics and he turned me down cold.

1155
01:06:55,121 --> 01:06:57,880
- Oh, now don't rub it in.
- I'm not rubbing it in.

1156
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,794
Well, I guess we better run along.

1157
01:06:59,794 --> 01:07:01,337
Awfully glad to have met you, Mary.

1158
01:07:01,337 --> 01:07:02,341
- Nice meeting you.
- Goodbye.

1159
01:07:02,341 --> 01:07:03,776
- Goodbye, George.
- So long, George.

1160
01:07:03,776 --> 01:07:04,797
- See you in the funny papers.
- Goodbye, Sam.

1161
01:07:04,797 --> 01:07:07,141
- So long, Mary.
- So long, Sam. Have fun.

1162
01:07:07,141 --> 01:07:08,221
Thanks for dropping around.

1163
01:07:08,221 --> 01:07:10,019
Florida! Hee-haw!

1164
01:07:10,019 --> 01:07:11,081
Hee-haw.

1165
01:07:40,416 --> 01:07:41,465
Thank you, sir.

1166
01:07:42,071 --> 01:07:43,408
Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.

1167
01:07:43,408 --> 01:07:45,889
You like it? I'll send you a box.

1168
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:58,761
Well, I, uh, I suppose 
I'll find out sooner or later,

1169
01:07:58,761 --> 01:08:01,120
but just what exactly did you want 
to see me about?

1170
01:08:02,877 --> 01:08:08,048
George, now that's just 
what I like so much about you.

1171
01:08:08,048 --> 01:08:11,836
George, I'm an old man, 
and most people hate me.

1172
01:08:11,836 --> 01:08:14,840
But I don't like them, either, 
so that that makes it all even.

1173
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:19,861
You know, just as well as I do, that I 
run practically everything in this town ...

1174
01:08:19,861 --> 01:08:22,800
but the Bailey Building and Loan.

1175
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:27,539
You know, also, that for a number of years 
I've been trying to get control of it or kill it.

1176
01:08:27,539 --> 01:08:29,870
But I haven't been able to do it.

1177
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:32,868
You have been stopping me.

1178
01:08:32,868 --> 01:08:36,196
In fact, you have beaten me, George,

1179
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:41,268
and as anyone in this county 
can tell you, that takes some doing.

1180
01:08:41,268 --> 01:08:44,494
Take during the depression, 
for instance.

1181
01:08:44,494 --> 01:08:47,790
You and I were the only ones 
that kept our heads.

1182
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:51,680
You saved the Building and Loan, 
I saved all the rest.

1183
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:54,448
Yeah. Well, most people say 
you stole all the rest.

1184
01:08:54,448 --> 01:08:58,732
The envious ones say that, 
George, the suckers.

1185
01:08:58,732 --> 01:09:03,282
Now, I have stated 
my side very frankly.

1186
01:09:03,282 --> 01:09:06,287
Now, let's look at your side.

1187
01:09:06,287 --> 01:09:13,229
Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, 
married, making say ... forty a week.

1188
01:09:13,229 --> 01:09:16,729
- Forty-five!
- Forty-five. Forty-five.

1189
01:09:16,729 --> 01:09:19,246
Out of which, after supporting 
your mother ...

1190
01:09:19,246 --> 01:09:23,883
and paying your bills, you're 
able to keep, say ten, if you skimp.

1191
01:09:23,883 --> 01:09:28,336
A child or two comes along, and you 
won't even be able to save the ten.

1192
01:09:28,336 --> 01:09:32,658
Now, if this young man of 
twenty-eight was a common,

1193
01:09:32,658 --> 01:09:35,667
ordinary yokel, 
I'd say he was doing fine.

1194
01:09:35,667 --> 01:09:39,901
But, George Bailey is not a common, 
ordinary yokel.

1195
01:09:39,901 --> 01:09:43,933
He's an intelligent, 
smart, ambitious young man,

1196
01:09:43,933 --> 01:09:49,421
who hates his job, who hates the Building 
and Loan, almost as much as I do.

1197
01:09:49,421 --> 01:09:54,359
A young man who's been dying to get 
out on his own ever since he was born.

1198
01:09:54,359 --> 01:09:57,386
A young man ... the smartest one 
of the crowd, mind you,

1199
01:09:57,386 --> 01:10:00,841
a young man who has to sit by and 
watch his friends go places,

1200
01:10:00,841 --> 01:10:02,540
because he's trapped.

1201
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:10,459
Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away  
playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic-eaters.

1202
01:10:10,459 --> 01:10:13,824
Do I paint a correct picture, 
or do I exaggerate?

1203
01:10:16,099 --> 01:10:17,625
Oh, what's your point, Mr. Potter?

1204
01:10:17,625 --> 01:10:21,197
- My point? My point is, I want to hire you.
- Hire me?

1205
01:10:21,197 --> 01:10:24,937
I want you to manage my affairs, 
run my properties.

1206
01:10:24,937 --> 01:10:30,056
George, I'll start you out at 
twenty thousand dollars a year.

1208
01:10:33,967 --> 01:10:37,007
Twenty thous ...
twenty thousand dollars a year?

1209
01:10:37,007 --> 01:10:40,476
You wouldn't mind living 
in the nicest house in town,

1210
01:10:40,476 --> 01:10:43,109
buying your wife 
a lot of fine clothes,

1211
01:10:43,109 --> 01:10:47,921
a couple of business trips to New York 
a year, maybe once in a while Europe.

1212
01:10:47,921 --> 01:10:49,593
You wouldn't mind that, 
would you, George?

1213
01:10:49,593 --> 01:10:51,032
Would I?

1214
01:10:53,843 --> 01:10:56,070
Y-You're not talking to somebody 
else around here, are you?

1215
01:10:56,070 --> 01:10:58,707
you know, th-this is me, 
you remember me? George Bailey.

1216
01:10:58,707 --> 01:11:04,278
Oh, yes, George Bailey. 
Whose ship has just come in,

1217
01:11:04,278 --> 01:11:07,626
provided he has enough brains 
to climb aboard.

1218
01:11:16,003 --> 01:11:17,272
Holy mackerel!

1219
01:11:20,315 --> 01:11:22,880
Well, how about the 
Building and Loan?

1220
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,522
Oh, confound it, man! 
Are you afraid of success?

1221
01:11:26,522 --> 01:11:31,569
I'm offering you a three-year contract at 
twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today.

1222
01:11:31,569 --> 01:11:33,426
Is it a deal, or isn't it?

1223
01:11:35,037 --> 01:11:36,820
Well, Mr. Potter, I ...

1224
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:41,647
I — I know I ought to jump 
at the chance but I — I just, uh,

1225
01:11:41,647 --> 01:11:45,606
I — I wonder if-if it would be possible for you 
to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?

1226
01:11:45,606 --> 01:11:47,475
Sure, sure, sure.

1227
01:11:47,475 --> 01:11:50,209
You go on home 
and talk about it to your wife.

1228
01:11:50,209 --> 01:11:51,822
- I'd like to do that.
- Yeah.

1229
01:11:51,822 --> 01:11:54,145
In the meantime, 
I'll draw up the papers.

1230
01:11:54,145 --> 01:11:56,415
- All right, sir.
- Okay, George?

1231
01:11:57,772 --> 01:11:59,299
Okay, Mr. Potter.

1233
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:12,512
No, no, no, no. Wait a minute here. 
Wait a minute.

1234
01:12:12,512 --> 01:12:15,607
I don't need twenty-four hours. 
I, I don't have to talk to anybody.

1235
01:12:15,607 --> 01:12:17,746
I know right now, 
and the answer is no! No!

1236
01:12:17,746 --> 01:12:19,338
Doggone it!

1237
01:12:19,338 --> 01:12:21,928
You sit around here 
and you spin your little webs ...

1238
01:12:21,928 --> 01:12:24,117
and you think the whole world revolves 
around you and your money.

1239
01:12:24,117 --> 01:12:25,983
Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter.

1240
01:12:25,983 --> 01:12:29,205
In the ... in the whole 
vast configuration of things,

1241
01:12:29,205 --> 01:12:32,177
I'd say you were nothing 
but a scurvy little spider.

1242
01:12:32,177 --> 01:12:36,946
You ... and that goes for you, too.

1243
01:12:40,858 --> 01:12:43,234
And it goes for you, too.

1244
01:12:49,954 --> 01:12:53,469
If you wouldn't mind living 
in the nicest house in town.

1245
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:56,358
Buying your wife 
a lot of fine clothes.

1246
01:12:56,358 --> 01:12:59,856
Going to New York on a business 
trip a couple of times a year.

1247
01:12:59,856 --> 01:13:02,421
Maybe to Europe once in a while.

1248
01:13:03,148 --> 01:13:05,031
I know what I'm going 
to do tomorrow ...

1249
01:13:05,031 --> 01:13:08,377
and the next day and next year 
and the hear after that.

1250
01:13:08,377 --> 01:13:13,570
I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town  
off my feet, and I'm going to see the world ...

1251
01:13:13,570 --> 01:13:16,421
and then I'm going to build things. 
I'm going to build air fields.

1252
01:13:16,421 --> 01:13:19,376
I'm going to build skyscrapers 
a hundred stories high.

1253
01:13:19,376 --> 01:13:22,831
I'm going to build 
a bridge a mile long.

1254
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:24,595
What is it you want,

1255
01:13:24,595 --> 01:13:26,485
Mary? What? Y-You want the moon?

1256
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:29,045
If you do, just say the word, 
I'll throw a lasso around it

1257
01:13:29,045 --> 01:13:31,140
and pulls her down for you.

1258
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,610
Buffalo Gals, 
won't you come out tonight,

1259
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:36,600
Won't you come out tonight, 
Won't you come out tonight.

1260
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:40,004
Buffalo Gals, 
won't you come out tonight,

1261
01:13:40,004 --> 01:13:42,055
And ...

1262
01:13:48,181 --> 01:13:49,807
- Hi.
- Hi.

1263
01:13:55,355 --> 01:13:56,759
Mary Hatch!

1264
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:03,319
Wh-Why in the world did you 
ever marry a guy like me?

1265
01:14:03,319 --> 01:14:05,860
To keep from being an old maid.

1266
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:09,937
You could have married Sam Wainwright 
and anybody else in town.

1267
01:14:09,937 --> 01:14:13,370
I didn't want to marry 
anybody else in town.

1268
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:15,798
I want my baby to look like you.

1269
01:14:15,798 --> 01:14:17,719
You didn't even have a honeymoon.

1270
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:21,320
I promised you ... your what?

1271
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,934
My baby.

1272
01:14:23,934 --> 01:14:29,222
You — You-You-You-You-You-You-You ...
Mary, you're on the nest?

1273
01:14:29,222 --> 01:14:31,937
George Bailey lassoes stork.

1274
01:14:31,937 --> 01:14:33,397
Lassoes the stork!

1275
01:14:35,416 --> 01:14:37,214
What do you ...

1276
01:14:37,214 --> 01:14:39,216
You mean ... you-you-you ...

1277
01:14:39,216 --> 01:14:41,438
What-what-what is it, 
a boy or a girl?

1278
01:14:41,438 --> 01:14:42,697
Uh-hm.

1279
01:14:44,757 --> 01:14:49,345
Now, you've probably already guessed 
that George never leaves Bedford Falls.

1280
01:14:49,345 --> 01:14:50,369
No!

1281
01:14:50,369 --> 01:14:53,493
Mary had her baby, a boy.

1282
01:14:53,493 --> 01:14:55,988
Then she had another one, a girl.

1283
01:14:55,988 --> 01:15:01,243
Day after day she worked away remaking 
the old Granville house into a home.

1284
01:15:01,243 --> 01:15:04,962
Night after night, George 
came back late from the office.

1285
01:15:08,548 --> 01:15:10,805
Potter was bearing down hard.

1286
01:15:15,985 --> 01:15:17,731
Then came a war.

1287
01:15:18,389 --> 01:15:22,469
Ma Bailey and Mrs. Hatch joined 
the Red Cross and sewed.

1288
01:15:22,469 --> 01:15:26,719
Mary had two more babies but still 
found time to run the U.S.O.

1289
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:30,713
Sam Wainwright made a fortune 
in plastic hoods for planes.

1290
01:15:30,713 --> 01:15:33,502
Potter became head of the draft board.

1291
01:15:33,502 --> 01:15:41,641
One-A ... one-A ... one-A

1292
01:15:41,641 --> 01:15:44,462
Gower and Uncle Billy sold war bonds.

1293
01:15:44,462 --> 01:15:49,036
Bert the cop was wounded in 
North Africa, got the Silver Star.

1294
01:15:49,036 --> 01:15:52,895
Ernie, the taxi-driver, 
parachuted into France.

1295
01:15:52,895 --> 01:15:56,328
Marty helped capture the Remagen Bridge.

1296
01:15:56,328 --> 01:16:00,086
Harry, Harry Bailey topped them all.

1297
01:16:00,086 --> 01:16:03,861
A Navy flier, 
he shot down fifteen planes.

1298
01:16:03,861 --> 01:16:08,239
Two of them as they were about to crash 
into a transport full of soldiers.

1299
01:16:09,663 --> 01:16:12,379
- Yes, but George ...
- George?

1300
01:16:12,379 --> 01:16:17,554
Four-F on account of his ear, 
George fought the battle of Bedford Falls.

1301
01:16:17,554 --> 01:16:19,692
Hold on, hold on, hold on now.

1302
01:16:19,692 --> 01:16:21,334
Don't you know there's a war on?

1303
01:16:21,334 --> 01:16:23,533
Air raid warden ...

1304
01:16:32,036 --> 01:16:36,536
paper drives ... scrap drives ...
rubber drives ...

1305
01:16:36,536 --> 01:16:42,112
Like everybody else, 
on V-E day he wept and prayed.

1306
01:16:42,112 --> 01:16:46,875
On V-J day, 
he wept and prayed again.

1307
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:49,403
Joseph, now show him 
what happened today.

1308
01:16:49,403 --> 01:16:50,728
Yes, sir.

1309
01:16:50,728 --> 01:16:55,625
This morning, day before Christmas, 
about ten A.M., Bedford Falls Time.

1310
01:16:55,625 --> 01:16:58,192
Hi, Ernie, look at that.

1311
01:17:03,444 --> 01:17:04,542
Gonna snow again.

1312
01:17:04,542 --> 01:17:07,841
What do you mean it's gonna snow? 
Look at the headlines.

1313
01:17:07,841 --> 01:17:10,335
I know, I know, George. 
And it's marvelous.

1314
01:17:10,335 --> 01:17:12,133
Commander Harry Bailey!

1315
01:17:12,133 --> 01:17:13,809
Mr. Gower, look at this.

1316
01:17:13,809 --> 01:17:15,873
The second page. 
Now look, this is for you.

1317
01:17:15,873 --> 01:17:17,665
This is for you. That's for you.

1318
01:17:17,665 --> 01:17:19,333
- Thanks.
- See you again.

1319
01:17:20,965 --> 01:17:23,122
Be sure you spell the name right.

1320
01:17:23,122 --> 01:17:25,046
Hello, Billy, how are you?

1321
01:17:33,202 --> 01:17:35,934
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

1322
01:17:35,934 --> 01:17:38,264
George! George! It's Harry now 
on long distance from Washington.

1323
01:17:38,264 --> 01:17:41,249
- Harry! What do you know about that!
- He reversed the charges. It's okay, isn't it?

1324
01:17:41,249 --> 01:17:43,899
Reverse the charges ...
of course it's for a hero.

1325
01:17:43,899 --> 01:17:45,402
Harry ...

1326
01:17:45,402 --> 01:17:48,377
Oh, you old seven times 
of a son of a gun.

1327
01:17:48,377 --> 01:17:49,664
Congratulations!

1328
01:17:49,664 --> 01:17:51,378
How's mother standing it?

1329
01:17:51,378 --> 01:17:52,810
She did?

1330
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:53,910
What do you know ...

1331
01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:55,491
Mother had lunch 
with the President's wife.

1332
01:17:55,491 --> 01:17:56,770
Wait till Martha hears about this.

1333
01:17:56,770 --> 01:17:58,629
- What did they have to eat?
- Wha-What did they have to eat?

1334
01:17:58,629 --> 01:18:03,427
H-H-Harry, you should see what they're 
cooking up in the town for you.

1335
01:18:03,427 --> 01:18:04,458
Oh, they are?

1336
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:06,409
The Navy's going to fly mother 
home this afternoon.

1337
01:18:06,409 --> 01:18:08,171
In a plane?

1338
01:18:08,171 --> 01:18:10,174
What? Uncle Billy?

1339
01:18:10,174 --> 01:18:12,240
- Has Uncle Billy come in yet?
- No, he stopped at the bank first.

1340
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:14,276
No, he's not here right now, Harry. 
But look ...

1341
01:18:14,276 --> 01:18:15,844
- George ...
- ... tell me about it.

1342
01:18:15,844 --> 01:18:17,937
... George, tha-that man's here again.

1343
01:18:17,937 --> 01:18:19,623
- What man?
- B-B-Bank ... examiner.

1344
01:18:19,623 --> 01:18:21,087
Oh, oh. Uh, uh,

1345
01:18:21,087 --> 01:18:23,295
Harry, talk to Eustace for a minute, 
will you?

1346
01:18:23,295 --> 01:18:25,355
I'll be right back. Well ...

1347
01:18:25,355 --> 01:18:27,357
- Harry ...
- Good morning, sir.

1348
01:18:27,357 --> 01:18:28,677
Carter, bank examiner.

1349
01:18:28,677 --> 01:18:31,089
- Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1350
01:18:31,089 --> 01:18:32,932
We're all excited around here.

1351
01:18:32,932 --> 01:18:34,902
My brother just got 
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

1352
01:18:34,902 --> 01:18:36,035
The president just decorated him.

1353
01:18:36,035 --> 01:18:37,867
Well, I guess they do those things.

1354
01:18:37,867 --> 01:18:39,649
Well, I trust you had a good year.

1355
01:18:39,649 --> 01:18:40,935
Good year?

1356
01:18:40,935 --> 01:18:44,301
Uh, well, between you and me, 
Mr. Carter, we're broke.

1357
01:18:44,301 --> 01:18:47,820
Yeah, very funny.

1358
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:50,666
Uh, w-well ... 
Now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.

1359
01:18:50,666 --> 01:18:55,212
Oh, I shouldn't wonder when you okay 
reverse charges on personal long distance calls.

1360
01:18:55,212 --> 01:18:56,243
George, shall we hang up?

1361
01:18:56,243 --> 01:18:58,441
No, no. He wants to talk to 
Uncle Billy. You just hold on.

1362
01:18:58,441 --> 01:19:01,312
Now, if you'll cooperate, I'd 
like to finish with you by tonight.

1363
01:19:01,312 --> 01:19:04,149
I want to spend Christmas 
in Elmira with my family.

1364
01:19:04,149 --> 01:19:05,572
I don't blame you at all, Mr. Carter.

1365
01:19:05,572 --> 01:19:07,807
Just step right in here. 
We'll fix you up.

1366
01:19:07,807 --> 01:19:11,585
December twenty-fourth ...

1367
01:19:16,794 --> 01:19:19,698
Eight thousand.

1368
01:19:20,358 --> 01:19:23,080
Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter ...

1369
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,252
Well, good morning, Mr. Potter?

1370
01:19:25,252 --> 01:19:26,613
What's the news?

1371
01:19:26,613 --> 01:19:30,320
Oh, well, well, well. Harry Bailey 
wins Congressional Medal.

1372
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,476
That couldn't be one of the Bailey boys?

1373
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:36,111
You just can't keep those Baileys 
down, now can you, Mr. Potter.

1374
01:19:36,111 --> 01:19:38,778
How does slacker George 
feel about that?

1375
01:19:38,778 --> 01:19:39,996
Very jealous. Very jealous.

1376
01:19:39,996 --> 01:19:42,322
He only lost three 
buttons off his vest.

1377
01:19:42,322 --> 01:19:46,522
Of course, slacker George would have gotten 
two of these medals if he had gone.

1378
01:19:46,522 --> 01:19:47,551
Bad ear.

1379
01:19:47,551 --> 01:19:51,770
Yes. After all, Potter, some people 
like George had to stay at home.

1380
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:55,658
Not every heel was in Germany and Japan.

1381
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:06,750
- Oh, good morning, Mr. Bailey.
- Good morning, Horace.

1382
01:20:08,071 --> 01:20:10,654
- I guess you forgot something.
- Huh?

1383
01:20:10,654 --> 01:20:12,727
- You forgot something.
- What?

1384
01:20:12,727 --> 01:20:15,152
- Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
- Oh, sure, sure I am.

1385
01:20:15,152 --> 01:20:17,990
Well, then it's usually customary 
to bring the money with you.

1386
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:22,404
Huh? Oh, shucks ...

1387
01:20:22,404 --> 01:20:25,645
Well, I knew I had ...

1388
01:20:25,645 --> 01:20:29,531
- How about that finger there?
- Hmm? Well, I ...

1389
01:20:29,531 --> 01:20:30,739
Bailey ...

1390
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:39,700
Take me back there. Hurry up.

1391
01:20:41,738 --> 01:20:43,860
Come on, look sharp.

1392
01:21:01,757 --> 01:21:02,918
Take me back.

1393
01:21:13,047 --> 01:21:16,311
Just make yourself at home, Mr. Carter. 
I'll get those books for you.

1394
01:21:16,311 --> 01:21:17,845
Oh, hello, Vi.

1395
01:21:17,845 --> 01:21:19,522
George, can I see you for a second?

1396
01:21:19,522 --> 01:21:22,581
Why, of course you can. 
Come on in the office here.

1397
01:21:22,581 --> 01:21:25,042
Uncle Billy, talk to Harry. 
He's on the telephone.

1398
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:28,894
Hurry, Uncle Billy, hurry. 
Long distance, Washington.

1399
01:21:28,894 --> 01:21:29,975
Hey, here's Harry on the phone.

1400
01:21:29,975 --> 01:21:31,295
Harry, your nephew, remember?

1401
01:21:31,295 --> 01:21:33,796
Here he is. Hurry up.

1402
01:21:33,796 --> 01:21:35,516
Hello — hello. Y-Y-Yes, Harry.

1403
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:37,542
Yes ... everything ...
everything's fine.

1404
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:41,208
I should have my head examined. 
Eight thousand dollars.

1405
01:21:41,208 --> 01:21:43,092
It's got to be somewhere.

1406
01:21:49,626 --> 01:21:50,678
Here you are.

1407
01:21:51,238 --> 01:21:52,957
Character?

1408
01:21:52,957 --> 01:21:54,198
If I had any character, I'd ...

1409
01:21:54,198 --> 01:21:57,972
It takes a lot of character to leave your 
home town and start all over again.

1410
01:21:57,972 --> 01:21:59,360
No, George, don't ...

1411
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:02,258
- Now here, now you're broke, aren't you?
- I know, but ...

1412
01:22:02,258 --> 01:22:05,106
What do you want to do, 
hock your furs and that hat?

1413
01:22:06,563 --> 01:22:07,954
Want to walk to New York?

1414
01:22:07,954 --> 01:22:09,665
You know, they charge for meals 
and rent up there

1415
01:22:09,665 --> 01:22:11,285
just the same as 
they do in Bedford Falls.

1416
01:22:11,285 --> 01:22:13,280
- Yeah, sure.
- It's a loan.

1417
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:15,910
That's my business. 
Building and Loan.

1418
01:22:15,910 --> 01:22:17,949
Besides, you'll get a job.

1419
01:22:17,949 --> 01:22:19,029
Good luck to you.

1420
01:22:19,029 --> 01:22:21,337
I'm glad I know you, George Bailey.

1421
01:22:26,599 --> 01:22:27,663
Say hello to New York for me.

1422
01:22:27,663 --> 01:22:29,087
Yeah, yeah ... sure, I will.

1423
01:22:29,087 --> 01:22:30,842
Now let's hear from you 
once in a while.

1424
01:22:31,909 --> 01:22:33,183
Hmm.

1425
01:22:35,374 --> 01:22:38,520
- Merry Christmas, Violet.
- Merry Christmas, George.

1426
01:22:39,248 --> 01:22:40,985
- Mr. Bailey.
- Oh, Mr. Carter,

1427
01:22:40,985 --> 01:22:42,436
I'm sorry. I'll be right with you.

1428
01:22:42,436 --> 01:22:45,024
- Uncle Billy in?
- Yeah, he's in his office.

1429
01:22:45,024 --> 01:22:47,426
Unc ... What's going on?

1430
01:22:47,426 --> 01:22:50,178
The bank examiner's here, and I ...

1431
01:22:50,178 --> 01:22:51,549
- He's here?
- Yeah, yeah.

1432
01:22:51,549 --> 01:22:53,385
He wants the accounts payable ...

1433
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:56,212
- What's the matter with you?
- Come here.

1434
01:23:17,090 --> 01:23:18,203
- Eustace.
- Yeah?

1435
01:23:18,203 --> 01:23:19,399
Come here a minute.

1436
01:23:21,135 --> 01:23:23,530
Did you see Uncle Billy with 
any cash last night?

1437
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:26,124
He had it on his desk counting it 
before he closed up.

1438
01:23:27,141 --> 01:23:28,666
Now look, did you buy anything?

1439
01:23:28,666 --> 01:23:31,154
- Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
- All right, all right.

1440
01:23:31,154 --> 01:23:33,478
Now, we'll go over every step you 
took since you left the house.

1441
01:23:33,478 --> 01:23:34,910
All right. This way.

1442
01:23:44,992 --> 01:23:46,892
And did you put the envelope 
in your pocket?

1443
01:23:46,892 --> 01:23:49,820
Yeah ... maybe, maybe, maybe ...

1444
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:51,461
Maybe-Maybe! 
I don't want any maybe.

1445
01:23:51,461 --> 01:23:53,208
We've got to find that money!

1446
01:23:53,208 --> 01:23:56,734
- I'm no good to you, George. I ...
- Uncle Billy, do you ...

1447
01:23:57,882 --> 01:24:03,035
Listen to me. Do you have any 
secret place hiding place?

1448
01:24:08,104 --> 01:24:11,421
Listen to me, listen to me! 
Think! Think!

1449
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:15,467
I can't think anymore, George. 
I can't think anymore. It hurts ...

1450
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:18,493
Where's that money, 
you silly, stupid old fool?!

1451
01:24:18,493 --> 01:24:19,679
Where's that money?

1452
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:21,408
Do you realize what this means?

1453
01:24:21,408 --> 01:24:24,562
It means bankruptcy 
and scandal, and prison!

1454
01:24:25,545 --> 01:24:26,849
That's what it means.

1455
01:24:26,849 --> 01:24:28,102
One of us is going to jail!

1456
01:24:28,102 --> 01:24:30,070
Well, it's not gonna be me.

1457
01:24:53,044 --> 01:24:54,106
Hello, darling.

1458
01:24:54,106 --> 01:24:55,887
Hello daddy, hello daddy.

1459
01:24:55,887 --> 01:24:58,060
How do you like it? 
We're going to put ...

1460
01:24:58,060 --> 01:24:59,983
Bless you!

1461
01:25:01,445 --> 01:25:02,446
Did you bring the wreath?

1462
01:25:02,446 --> 01:25:05,411
- Yes, Daddy, did you bring the Christmas wreath?
- What wreath?

1463
01:25:05,411 --> 01:25:07,982
Oh, that's the Merry Christmas Wreath 
for the window.

1464
01:25:07,982 --> 01:25:09,572
No. I left it at the office.

1465
01:25:09,572 --> 01:25:11,660
- Is it snowing?
- Yeah, just started.

1466
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:15,235
- Where's your coat and hat?
- Left them at the office.

1467
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:18,131
- What's the matter?
- Nothing's the matter. Everything's all right.

1468
01:25:26,370 --> 01:25:28,389
Go on, Pete, you're a big boy.

1469
01:25:28,389 --> 01:25:29,628
You can put the star up.

1470
01:25:29,628 --> 01:25:31,638
Way up at the top.

1471
01:25:31,638 --> 01:25:33,399
That's it.

1472
01:25:33,399 --> 01:25:34,635
All right.

1473
01:25:34,635 --> 01:25:36,346
Fill in that little bare 
spot right there.

1474
01:25:36,346 --> 01:25:37,600
That's it.

1475
01:25:39,641 --> 01:25:41,629
Isn't it wonderful about Harry?

1476
01:25:41,629 --> 01:25:43,003
We're famous, George.

1477
01:25:43,003 --> 01:25:47,033
I'll bet I had fifty calls today 
about the parade, the banquet.

1478
01:25:47,033 --> 01:25:49,328
Your mother's so excited, she ...

1479
01:26:10,001 --> 01:26:12,225
Must she keep playing that?

1480
01:26:12,225 --> 01:26:14,979
I have to practice it 
for the party tonight, Daddy.

1481
01:26:14,979 --> 01:26:18,225
Mommy says we can stay up till 
midnight and sing Christmas carols.

1482
01:26:18,225 --> 01:26:19,549
Can you sing, Daddy?

1483
01:26:20,173 --> 01:26:22,016
Better hurry and shave.

1484
01:26:22,016 --> 01:26:23,608
The families will be here soon.

1485
01:26:23,608 --> 01:26:27,081
Families! I — I don't want 
the families over here.

1486
01:26:29,034 --> 01:26:32,475
Come on out in the kitchen 
with me while I finish dinner.

1487
01:26:32,475 --> 01:26:35,743
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1488
01:26:35,743 --> 01:26:36,946
Have a hectic day?

1489
01:26:36,946 --> 01:26:41,005
Oh, yeah. Another big red-letter 
day for the Bailey's.

1490
01:26:41,005 --> 01:26:43,801
Daddy, the Brown's next door 
have a new car. You should see it.

1491
01:26:43,801 --> 01:26:46,248
Well, what's the matter with our car? 
Isn't it good enough for you?

1492
01:26:46,248 --> 01:26:47,603
Yes, Daddy.

1493
01:26:47,603 --> 01:26:50,101
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1494
01:26:50,101 --> 01:26:51,440
Excuse you for what?

1495
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:52,772
I burped!

1496
01:26:53,805 --> 01:26:55,076
All right, darling, you're excused.

1497
01:26:55,076 --> 01:26:57,502
Now go upstairs and see 
what little Zuzu wants.

1498
01:26:58,518 --> 01:27:00,385
Zuzu. W-What's the matter with Zuzu?

1499
01:27:00,385 --> 01:27:02,429
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed.

1500
01:27:02,429 --> 01:27:04,159
Caught it coming home from school.

1501
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:05,733
They gave her a flower for a prize

1502
01:27:05,733 --> 01:27:08,069
and she didn't want to crush it 
so she didn't button up her coat.

1503
01:27:08,069 --> 01:27:10,263
- What is it, a sore throat or what?
- Just a cold.

1504
01:27:10,263 --> 01:27:11,361
- The doctor says it's nothing serious.
- The doctor?

1505
01:27:11,361 --> 01:27:13,460
- Was the doctor here?
- Yes, I called him right away.

1506
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:15,205
- He says it's nothing to worry about.
- Is she running a temperature?

1507
01:27:15,205 --> 01:27:17,538
- What is it?
- Just a teensy one, ninety-nine, six.

1508
01:27:17,538 --> 01:27:19,831
- She'll be all right.
- Gosh, it's this old house.

1509
01:27:19,831 --> 01:27:22,210
I don't ... I don't know 
why we don't all have pneumonia.

1510
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:26,934
This drafty old barn! Might as 
well be living in a refrigerator.

1511
01:27:26,934 --> 01:27:31,673
Why did we have to live here in the first place 
and stay around this measly, crummy old town?

1512
01:27:32,705 --> 01:27:33,824
George, what's wrong?

1513
01:27:33,824 --> 01:27:35,047
Wrong? Everything's wrong.

1514
01:27:35,047 --> 01:27:36,421
You call this a happy family?

1515
01:27:36,421 --> 01:27:38,728
Why did we have to have all these kids?

1516
01:27:38,728 --> 01:27:40,143
Dad, how do you spell 'frankincense'?

1517
01:27:40,143 --> 01:27:42,386
I don't know. Why, ask your mother.

1518
01:27:42,386 --> 01:27:44,419
- Where're you going?
- Going up to see Zuzu.

1519
01:27:44,419 --> 01:27:46,554
He told me to write a play for tomorrow.

1520
01:27:57,518 --> 01:28:01,489
F-R-A-N-K-I-N ...

1521
01:28:01,489 --> 01:28:02,951
Hi, Daddy.

1522
01:28:04,069 --> 01:28:07,648
- Well, what happened to you?
- I won a flower.

1523
01:28:07,648 --> 01:28:09,413
Wait now. 
W-Where do you think you're going?

1524
01:28:09,413 --> 01:28:11,075
Want to give my flower a drink.

1525
01:28:11,075 --> 01:28:13,608
All right, all right, here, 
give Daddy the flower.

1526
01:28:13,608 --> 01:28:16,273
I'll give it a drink. 
All right, here.

1527
01:28:17,765 --> 01:28:22,850
- Look, Daddy ... paste it.
- Yeah, all right ...

1528
01:28:26,628 --> 01:28:28,733
Now, I'll paste this together.

1529
01:28:32,305 --> 01:28:37,727
Now, there it is, good as new. 
All right, give the flower a drink.

1530
01:28:37,727 --> 01:28:40,095
- Now, will you do something for me?
- What?

1531
01:28:40,095 --> 01:28:42,149
Will you try to get some sleep?

1532
01:28:42,149 --> 01:28:45,209
I'm not sleepy. 
I want to look at my flower.

1533
01:28:45,209 --> 01:28:47,755
I know, I know, 
but you just go to sleep

1534
01:28:47,755 --> 01:28:52,212
and then you can dream about it, 
and it'll be a whole garden.

1535
01:28:52,212 --> 01:28:54,389
- It will?
- Uh-huh.

1536
01:29:01,848 --> 01:29:04,989
- Telephone!
- I'll get it.

1537
01:29:07,198 --> 01:29:09,126
Hello.

1538
01:29:09,126 --> 01:29:11,448
Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey.

1539
01:29:11,448 --> 01:29:14,607
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch. 
I'm sure she'll be all right.

1540
01:29:14,607 --> 01:29:17,354
The doctor says that she ought to be out 
of bed in time to have her Christmas dinner.

1541
01:29:17,354 --> 01:29:19,026
- Is that Zuzu's teacher?
- Yes.

1542
01:29:19,026 --> 01:29:20,462
Let me speak to her.

1543
01:29:20,462 --> 01:29:23,419
Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch?

1544
01:29:23,419 --> 01:29:25,917
This is George Bailey. 
I'm Zuzu's father.

1545
01:29:25,917 --> 01:29:27,562
Say, what kind of a teacher 
are you anyway?

1546
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:29,972
What do you mean sending her home 
like that, half naked?

1547
01:29:29,972 --> 01:29:32,127
Do you realize she'll probably end up 
with pneumonia on account of you?

1548
01:29:32,127 --> 01:29:33,636
- George!
- Is this the sort of thing

1549
01:29:33,636 --> 01:29:36,652
we pay taxes for — to have teachers ...
to have teachers like you?

1550
01:29:36,652 --> 01:29:40,181
Stupid, silly, careless people who send 
our kids home without any clothes on?

1551
01:29:40,181 --> 01:29:42,166
You know, maybe my kids aren't 
the best-dressed kids,

1552
01:29:42,166 --> 01:29:43,964
and maybe they don't have 
any decent clothes ...

1553
01:29:43,964 --> 01:29:46,104
Aw, that stupid ...

1554
01:29:46,104 --> 01:29:49,593
He-Hello, Mrs. Welch. 
I — I — I want to apologize.

1555
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:52,396
Hel-lo ... hello ...

1556
01:29:53,427 --> 01:29:55,999
- She's hung up.
- I — I — I'll hang her up.

1557
01:29:55,999 --> 01:29:57,995
Now, who do you think you are?

1558
01:29:57,995 --> 01:29:59,180
What is that?

1559
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:00,978
Hello? Who is this?

1560
01:30:00,978 --> 01:30:02,982
Oh, Mr. Welch?

1561
01:30:02,982 --> 01:30:04,454
Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch.

1562
01:30:04,454 --> 01:30:06,637
Gives me a chance to tell you 
what I really think of your wife.

1563
01:30:06,637 --> 01:30:09,629
- George ...
- Will you get out and let me handle this?

1564
01:30:09,629 --> 01:30:11,172
Hello?

1565
01:30:11,172 --> 01:30:15,535
Hello? What? Oh, you will, huh?

1566
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:18,569
Okay, Mr. Welch. Any time you 
think you're man enough.

1567
01:30:18,569 --> 01:30:22,268
Hello ... any ...

1568
01:30:22,268 --> 01:30:23,818
Oh ...

1569
01:30:23,818 --> 01:30:25,257
Daddy, how do you spell 
"Hallelujah?"

1570
01:30:25,257 --> 01:30:27,195
How should I know? What do you 
think I am, a dictionary?

1571
01:30:27,195 --> 01:30:28,756
Tommy, stop that! Stop it!

1572
01:30:28,756 --> 01:30:31,949
Janie, haven't you leaned that silly tune yet? 
You've played it over and over again.

1573
01:30:31,949 --> 01:30:33,695
Now stop it! Stop it!

1574
01:31:01,525 --> 01:31:03,389
I'm sorry, Mary.

1575
01:31:06,349 --> 01:31:07,946
Janie, I'm sorry.

1576
01:31:09,099 --> 01:31:11,236
I didn't mean ...

1577
01:31:11,843 --> 01:31:13,864
You go on and practice.

1578
01:31:18,679 --> 01:31:22,541
Pete, I owe you an apology, too.

1579
01:31:22,541 --> 01:31:24,014
I'm sorry.

1580
01:31:25,201 --> 01:31:26,726
What do you want to know?

1581
01:31:26,726 --> 01:31:28,064
Nothing, Daddy.

1582
01:31:34,975 --> 01:31:36,741
What's the matter with everybody?

1583
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:38,368
Janie, go on. 
I told you to practice.

1584
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:41,503
- Now, go on, play.
- Oh, Daddy ...

1585
01:31:46,252 --> 01:31:47,817
George, why must you 
torture the children?

1586
01:31:47,817 --> 01:31:49,104
Why don't you ...

1587
01:31:50,477 --> 01:31:51,643
Mary ...

1588
01:32:05,881 --> 01:32:07,630
Bedford two-four-seven, please.

1589
01:32:07,630 --> 01:32:09,790
- Is Daddy in trouble?
- Yes, Pete.

1590
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:13,027
- Shall I pray for him?
- Yes, Janie, pray very hard.

1591
01:32:13,027 --> 01:32:16,026
- Me, too?
- You, too, Tommy.

1592
01:32:16,026 --> 01:32:18,604
Hello, Uncle Billy?

1593
01:32:18,604 --> 01:32:21,112
I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter.

1594
01:32:21,112 --> 01:32:23,388
I need help.

1595
01:32:23,388 --> 01:32:26,258
Through some sort of an accident 
my company's short in their accounts.

1596
01:32:26,258 --> 01:32:28,278
The bank examiner's got there today.

1597
01:32:28,278 --> 01:32:30,486
I've got to raise eight 
thousand dollars immediately.

1598
01:32:30,486 --> 01:32:33,084
Oh, so that's what the reporters 
wanted to talk to you about?

1599
01:32:33,084 --> 01:32:34,437
- The reporters?
- Yes,

1600
01:32:34,437 --> 01:32:38,161
they called me up 
from your Building and Loan.

1601
01:32:38,161 --> 01:32:41,776
Oh, there's a man over there 
from the D.A.'s office, too.

1602
01:32:41,776 --> 01:32:42,977
He's looking for you.

1603
01:32:42,977 --> 01:32:44,947
Please help me, Mr. Potter.

1604
01:32:44,947 --> 01:32:46,641
Help me, won't you, please?

1605
01:32:46,641 --> 01:32:48,542
Can't you see 
what it means to my family?

1606
01:32:48,542 --> 01:32:51,479
I'll pay any sort of a bonus 
on the loan, any interest ...

1607
01:32:51,479 --> 01:32:53,219
if you still want the 
Building and Loan. I'm ...

1608
01:32:53,219 --> 01:32:56,866
George, could it possibly be there's 
a slight discrepancy in the books?

1609
01:32:56,866 --> 01:32:58,253
No, sir. There's nothing 
wrong with the books.

1610
01:32:58,253 --> 01:32:59,777
I've just misplaced 
eight thousand dollars.

1611
01:32:59,777 --> 01:33:01,490
I can't find it anywhere.

1612
01:33:01,490 --> 01:33:04,720
You misplaced eight thousand dollars?

1613
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:05,826
Yes, sir.

1614
01:33:08,649 --> 01:33:10,393
Have you notified the police?

1615
01:33:10,393 --> 01:33:12,205
No, sir. 
I — I didn't want the publicity.

1616
01:33:12,205 --> 01:33:14,031
Harry's homecoming tomorrow ...

1617
01:33:14,031 --> 01:33:16,408
They're gonna believe that one.

1618
01:33:16,408 --> 01:33:18,785
What've you been doing, George?

1619
01:33:18,785 --> 01:33:20,482
Playing the market 
with the company's money?

1620
01:33:20,482 --> 01:33:21,716
No, sir, no, sir. I haven't.

1621
01:33:21,716 --> 01:33:23,738
What is it, a woman then?

1622
01:33:23,738 --> 01:33:27,836
You know, it's all over town that 
you've been giving money to Violet Bick.

1623
01:33:27,836 --> 01:33:30,177
- What!
- Not that it makes any difference to me,

1624
01:33:30,177 --> 01:33:31,437
but why did you come to me?

1625
01:33:31,437 --> 01:33:34,205
Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright 
and ask him for the money?

1626
01:33:34,205 --> 01:33:35,785
I can't get ahold of him. 
He's in Europe.

1627
01:33:35,785 --> 01:33:37,395
Well, what about all your other friends?

1628
01:33:37,395 --> 01:33:39,194
They don't have that kind of money, 
Mr. Potter.

1629
01:33:39,194 --> 01:33:41,647
You know that. You're the only one 
in town that can help me.

1630
01:33:41,647 --> 01:33:43,526
I see.

1631
01:33:43,526 --> 01:33:47,114
I've suddenly become quite important.

1632
01:33:47,114 --> 01:33:50,023
Wha-What kind of security 
would I have, George?

1633
01:33:50,023 --> 01:33:53,315
- Have you got any stocks?
- No, sir.

1634
01:33:53,315 --> 01:33:56,184
Bonds? Real estate? 
Collateral of any kind?

1635
01:33:56,706 --> 01:34:01,007
I have some life insurance, 
a fifteen thousand dollar policy.

1636
01:34:01,007 --> 01:34:03,282
Yes ... how much is your equity in it?

1637
01:34:03,282 --> 01:34:07,090
- Five hundred dollars.
- Five hundred dollars!

1638
01:34:07,090 --> 01:34:11,370
And you ask me 
to lend you eight thousand.

1639
01:34:11,370 --> 01:34:12,518
Look at you.

1640
01:34:12,518 --> 01:34:14,745
You used to be so cocky!

1641
01:34:14,745 --> 01:34:18,346
You were going to go out 
and conquer the world.

1642
01:34:18,346 --> 01:34:23,895
You once called me a warped, 
frustrated old man.

1643
01:34:23,895 --> 01:34:27,805
What are you 
but a warped frustrated young man?

1644
01:34:27,805 --> 01:34:33,214
A miserable little clerk crawling in here 
on your hands and knees and begging for help.

1645
01:34:33,214 --> 01:34:35,313
No securities, no stocks, no bonds,

1646
01:34:35,313 --> 01:34:42,014
nothing but a miserable little five hundred 
dollar equity in a life insurance policy.

1647
01:34:42,014 --> 01:34:44,902
You're worth more dead than alive.

1648
01:34:44,902 --> 01:34:48,081
Why don't you go to the riff-raff 
you love so much ...

1649
01:34:48,081 --> 01:34:51,010
ask them to let you 
have eight thousand?

1650
01:34:51,010 --> 01:34:52,228
You know why?

1651
01:34:52,228 --> 01:34:54,964
Because they'd run you 
out of town on a rail.

1652
01:34:54,964 --> 01:34:58,297
But I tell you what I'm going 
to do for you, George.

1653
01:34:58,297 --> 01:35:01,595
Since the state examiner is still here,

1654
01:35:01,595 --> 01:35:04,194
as a stock holder 
of the Building and Loan,

1655
01:35:04,194 --> 01:35:07,594
I'm going to swear out a warrant 
for your arrest.

1656
01:35:07,594 --> 01:35:12,254
Misappropriation of funds, 
manipulation, malfeasance ...

1657
01:35:13,134 --> 01:35:15,648
All right, George, go ahead, George.

1658
01:35:15,648 --> 01:35:18,776
You can't hide in a 
little town like this.

1659
01:35:18,776 --> 01:35:21,221
Bill? This is Potter.

1660
01:35:34,038 --> 01:35:36,975
Joe! Merry Christmas!

1661
01:35:36,975 --> 01:35:38,622
- Glad you come.
- Thank you.

1662
01:35:38,622 --> 01:35:41,408
- How about some of that good spaghetti?
- We got everything.

1663
01:35:53,190 --> 01:35:54,824
God ...

1664
01:35:57,851 --> 01:35:59,101
Oh, God ...

1665
01:36:03,936 --> 01:36:05,835
Dear Father in Heaven,

1666
01:36:09,015 --> 01:36:13,116
I'm not a praying man, but 
if you're up there,

1667
01:36:13,116 --> 01:36:18,816
and you can hear me, 
show me the way.

1668
01:36:18,816 --> 01:36:22,961
I'm at the end of my rope. 
I ...

1669
01:36:22,961 --> 01:36:25,678
Show me the way, God.

1670
01:36:30,164 --> 01:36:31,537
Are you all right, George?

1671
01:36:31,537 --> 01:36:33,412
Want someone to take you home?

1672
01:36:36,227 --> 01:36:38,628
Why you drink so much, my friend?

1673
01:36:38,628 --> 01:36:42,497
Please go home, Mr. Bailey. 
This is Christmas Eve.

1674
01:36:42,497 --> 01:36:45,725
Bailey? Which Bailey?

1675
01:36:45,725 --> 01:36:47,950
This is Mr. George Bailey.

1676
01:36:52,021 --> 01:36:54,852
And the next time you talk to my 
wife like that, you'll get worse.

1677
01:36:54,852 --> 01:36:56,355
She cried for an hour.

1678
01:36:56,355 --> 01:36:58,825
It isn't enough she slaves 
teaching your stupid kids

1679
01:36:58,825 --> 01:37:00,771
how to read and write, and you 
have to bawl her out, eh.

1680
01:37:00,771 --> 01:37:02,011
You get out of here, Mr. Welch!

1681
01:37:02,011 --> 01:37:03,530
Now wait. 
I want to pay for my drink.

1682
01:37:03,530 --> 01:37:05,482
Never mind the money. 
You get out of here quick.

1683
01:37:05,482 --> 01:37:08,600
- All right.
- You hit my best friend. Get out!

1684
01:37:13,874 --> 01:37:15,633
You all right, George?

1685
01:37:15,633 --> 01:37:16,802
Who was that?

1686
01:37:16,802 --> 01:37:19,003
He gone. No worry.

1687
01:37:19,003 --> 01:37:21,630
His name is Welch. 
He no come in to my place no more.

1688
01:37:21,630 --> 01:37:24,926
Oh, Welch. 
That's what I get for praying.

1689
01:37:24,926 --> 01:37:26,958
The last time he come in here. 
You hear that, Nick?

1690
01:37:26,958 --> 01:37:28,166
Yes, you bet.

1691
01:37:28,166 --> 01:37:31,838
Where's my insurance policy? 
Oh, here.

1692
01:37:31,838 --> 01:37:33,693
- Oh, no, please, no go out this way, Mr. Bailey.
- I'm all right.

1693
01:37:33,693 --> 01:37:35,835
No, no, you no feel so good. 
Sit down and rest.

1694
01:37:35,835 --> 01:37:38,767
- I'm all right.
- Please no go away. Please!

1695
01:37:57,344 --> 01:37:58,650
What do you think you're doing?

1696
01:38:01,745 --> 01:38:03,203
Now look what you did.

1697
01:38:03,203 --> 01:38:05,518
My great-grandfather planted this tree.

1698
01:38:06,447 --> 01:38:08,518
Hey, you! Hey, you!

1699
01:38:09,193 --> 01:38:10,984
Come back here, you drunken fool!

1700
01:38:10,984 --> 01:38:12,815
Get this car out of here!

1701
01:38:20,912 --> 01:38:23,121
Hey, what's the matter with you? 
Look where you're going!

1702
01:39:11,343 --> 01:39:12,801
Help!

1703
01:39:14,056 --> 01:39:18,624
Help! Help! Help!

1704
01:39:20,357 --> 01:39:22,949
Help! Help!

1705
01:39:24,678 --> 01:39:26,930
Help!

1706
01:39:29,189 --> 01:39:33,559
Help! Help! Help! Help!

1707
01:39:35,733 --> 01:39:37,097
Help!

1708
01:39:38,215 --> 01:39:42,330
Help! Help! Help!

1709
01:39:58,683 --> 01:40:00,975
I didn't have time to get 
some stylish underwear.

1710
01:40:00,975 --> 01:40:03,435
My wife gave me this 
on my last birthday.

1711
01:40:04,483 --> 01:40:06,325
I passed away in it.

1712
01:40:09,794 --> 01:40:12,503
Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too.

1713
01:40:15,905 --> 01:40:18,700
You should read the new book 
Mark Twain's writing now.

1714
01:40:19,930 --> 01:40:21,895
How did you happen to fall in?

1715
01:40:21,895 --> 01:40:25,431
I didn't fall in. 
I jumped in to save George.

1716
01:40:25,431 --> 01:40:28,520
You what? 
To ... to save me?

1717
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:31,707
Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't 
go through with it, did you?

1718
01:40:31,707 --> 01:40:33,924
- Go through with what?
- Suicide.

1719
01:40:33,924 --> 01:40:37,109
Well, it's against the law 
to commit suicide around here.

1720
01:40:37,109 --> 01:40:39,979
Yeah, it's against the law 
where I come from, too.

1721
01:40:39,979 --> 01:40:42,767
- Where do you come from?
- Heaven.

1722
01:40:47,532 --> 01:40:50,558
I had to act quickly. 
That's why I jumped in.

1723
01:40:50,558 --> 01:40:53,075
I knew if I were drowning 
you'd try to save me.

1724
01:40:53,075 --> 01:40:56,227
And you see, you did, 
and that's how I saved you.

1725
01:40:56,227 --> 01:40:58,399
Very funny.

1726
01:40:58,399 --> 01:41:00,469
Your lip's bleeding, George.

1727
01:41:00,469 --> 01:41:04,758
Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw in 
answer to a prayer a little bit ago.

1728
01:41:04,758 --> 01:41:08,636
Oh, no, no, no, George, 
I'm the answer to your prayer.

1729
01:41:08,636 --> 01:41:10,670
That's why I was sent down here.

1730
01:41:11,532 --> 01:41:13,012
How do you know my name?

1731
01:41:13,012 --> 01:41:16,599
Oh, I know all about you. I've 
watched you grow up from a little boy.

1732
01:41:16,599 --> 01:41:19,472
- What are you, a mind reader or something?
- Oh, no.

1733
01:41:19,472 --> 01:41:24,076
- Well, who are you then?
- Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.

1734
01:41:24,076 --> 01:41:28,786
Odbody ... A-S-2. 
Wh-Wh-What's that A-S-2?

1735
01:41:28,786 --> 01:41:30,328
Angel Second Class.

1736
01:41:40,984 --> 01:41:42,681
Cheerio, my good man.

1737
01:41:46,868 --> 01:41:48,341
Oh, brother ...

1738
01:41:53,082 --> 01:41:55,267
I wonder what Martini 
put in those drinks?

1739
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:00,179
Hey, what's ... with you ...

1740
01:42:00,179 --> 01:42:02,625
wh-wh-what-did you say 
just a minute ago?

1741
01:42:02,625 --> 01:42:04,304
Why'd you want to save me?

1742
01:42:04,304 --> 01:42:08,438
That's what I was sent down for. 
I'm your guardian angel.

1743
01:42:08,438 --> 01:42:10,577
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

1744
01:42:10,577 --> 01:42:13,690
Ridiculous of you to think of 
killing yourself for money.

1745
01:42:13,690 --> 01:42:16,439
- Eight thousand dollars.
- Yeah, I'll say. Just things like that.

1746
01:42:16,439 --> 01:42:18,153
Now how do you know that?

1747
01:42:18,153 --> 01:42:19,983
I told you. I'm your guardian angel.

1748
01:42:19,983 --> 01:42:21,814
I know everything about you.

1749
01:42:23,153 --> 01:42:26,382
Well, you look about like 
the kind of an angel I'd get.

1750
01:42:26,382 --> 01:42:28,231
Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you?

1751
01:42:28,231 --> 01:42:29,399
What happened to your wings?

1752
01:42:29,399 --> 01:42:33,045
I haven't won my wings yet. 
That's why I'm an angel second class.

1753
01:42:37,813 --> 01:42:41,245
I don't know whether I like it very much being 
seen around with an angel without any wings.

1754
01:42:41,245 --> 01:42:45,027
Oh, I — I've got to earn them 
and you'll help me, won't you?

1755
01:42:45,027 --> 01:42:49,855
- Sure, sure. How?
- By letting me help you.

1756
01:42:51,534 --> 01:42:52,605
Only one way you can help me.

1757
01:42:52,605 --> 01:42:54,659
Y-You don't happen to have 
eight thousand bucks on you?

1758
01:42:54,659 --> 01:42:57,267
Oh, no, no. 
We don't use money in heaven.

1759
01:42:57,267 --> 01:43:00,550
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting.

1760
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:02,485
Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.

1761
01:43:02,485 --> 01:43:05,256
Oh, tut, tut, tut.

1762
01:43:05,256 --> 01:43:07,855
I found it out a little late.

1763
01:43:07,855 --> 01:43:09,979
I'm worth more dead than alive.

1764
01:43:09,979 --> 01:43:14,215
Now look, you mustn't talk like that. 
I won't get my wings with that attitude.

1765
01:43:14,215 --> 01:43:16,745
You just don't know 
all that you've done.

1766
01:43:16,745 --> 01:43:17,948
If it hadn't been for you ...

1767
01:43:17,948 --> 01:43:20,847
Yeah, if it hadn't been for me, 
everybody'd be a lot better off.

1768
01:43:20,847 --> 01:43:22,915
My wife, and my kids, and my friends.

1769
01:43:22,915 --> 01:43:26,228
And my ... Look, little fellow, why, you 
go off and haunt somebody else, will you?

1770
01:43:26,228 --> 01:43:29,014
No, no, you don't understand. 
I've got my job.

1771
01:43:29,014 --> 01:43:30,828
Aw, shut up, will you?

1772
01:43:35,015 --> 01:43:38,092
Hmmm, this isn't gonna be so easy.

1773
01:43:42,467 --> 01:43:47,364
Yeah! So you still think killing yourself 
would make everyone feel happier, eh?

1774
01:43:48,807 --> 01:43:51,233
Oh, I don't know. 
I guess you're right.

1775
01:43:52,930 --> 01:43:55,956
I suppose it would have been better 
if I'd never been born at all.

1776
01:43:55,956 --> 01:43:59,399
- What'd you say?
- I said I wish I'd never been born.

1777
01:43:59,399 --> 01:44:02,308
Oh, you mustn't say things like that.

1778
01:44:02,308 --> 01:44:03,629
You ...

1779
01:44:03,629 --> 01:44:05,802
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1780
01:44:05,802 --> 01:44:07,964
That's an idea.

1781
01:44:07,964 --> 01:44:12,714
What do you think? 
Yeah, that'll do it.

1782
01:44:12,714 --> 01:44:13,834
All right.

1783
01:44:16,829 --> 01:44:18,593
You've got your wish.

1784
01:44:18,593 --> 01:44:20,314
You've never been born.

1785
01:44:25,412 --> 01:44:27,786
You don't have to make 
all that fuss about it.

1786
01:44:29,568 --> 01:44:30,986
What did you say?

1787
01:44:30,986 --> 01:44:33,552
You've never been born. 
You don't exist.

1788
01:44:33,552 --> 01:44:34,857
You haven't a care in the world.

1789
01:44:34,857 --> 01:44:38,378
No worries, no obligations, 
no eight thousand dollars to get,

1790
01:44:38,378 --> 01:44:40,211
no Potter looking for you 
with the sheriff.

1791
01:44:40,211 --> 01:44:43,057
- Say something else in that ear.
- Sure. You can hear out of it.

1792
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:46,129
Well, that's the doggonedest thing.

1793
01:44:46,129 --> 01:44:48,600
I haven't heard anything out 
of that ear since I was a kid.

1794
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:50,857
Must have been that jump in 
that cold water.

1795
01:44:50,857 --> 01:44:53,095
Your lip's stopped 
bleeding, too, George.

1796
01:44:58,432 --> 01:44:59,957
What do you know about that?

1797
01:45:01,110 --> 01:45:02,174
What's happened?

1798
01:45:03,462 --> 01:45:05,853
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it?

1799
01:45:05,853 --> 01:45:08,468
Well, I, uh ...
What's happened here?

1800
01:45:08,468 --> 01:45:10,266
What I need is a couple of 
good stiff drinks.

1801
01:45:10,266 --> 01:45:12,320
How about you, angel, 
you want a drink?

1802
01:45:14,358 --> 01:45:16,394
Come on, soon as 
these clothes of ours are dry ...

1803
01:45:16,394 --> 01:45:18,628
Those are dry.

1804
01:45:18,628 --> 01:45:20,257
What do you know about that?

1805
01:45:20,257 --> 01:45:21,563
Stove's hotter than I thought.

1806
01:45:21,563 --> 01:45:24,981
Now, come on, get your clothes on, 
and we'll stroll up to my car and get ...

1807
01:45:24,981 --> 01:45:28,090
Oh, I'm sorry. 
I'll stroll, you fly.

1808
01:45:28,090 --> 01:45:29,870
I can't fly. 
I haven't got my wings.

1809
01:45:29,870 --> 01:45:31,702
You haven't got your wings. 
Yeah, that's right.

1810
01:45:38,309 --> 01:45:39,581
What's the matter?

1811
01:45:39,581 --> 01:45:42,452
Well, this is where I left 
my car and it isn't here.

1812
01:45:42,452 --> 01:45:43,706
You have no car.

1813
01:45:43,706 --> 01:45:47,481
Well, I had a car and it was right 
here. I guess somebody moved it.

1814
01:45:47,481 --> 01:45:50,193
- Good evening.
- Oh, say ... Hey ...

1815
01:45:50,193 --> 01:45:51,883
wh-where's my car.

1816
01:45:51,883 --> 01:45:53,859
- I beg your pardon?
- My car, my car.

1817
01:45:53,859 --> 01:45:56,340
I'm the fellow that owns the car 
that ran into your tree.

1818
01:45:56,340 --> 01:45:58,385
What tree?
What do you mean, what tree?

1819
01:45:58,385 --> 01:46:00,643
This tree. Here. I ran into it.

1820
01:46:00,643 --> 01:46:04,484
Cut a big gash 
in the side of it there.

1821
01:46:08,178 --> 01:46:10,539
You must mean two other trees.

1822
01:46:10,539 --> 01:46:11,776
You had me worried.

1823
01:46:11,776 --> 01:46:14,018
One of the oldest 
trees in Pottersville.

1824
01:46:14,018 --> 01:46:16,891
Pottersville. 
Why, you mean Bedford Falls.

1825
01:46:16,891 --> 01:46:18,759
I mean Pottersville.

1826
01:46:18,759 --> 01:46:20,711
Don't you think 
I know where I live?

1827
01:46:20,711 --> 01:46:22,003
What's the matter with you?

1828
01:46:28,641 --> 01:46:31,955
Oh, I don't know. 
Either I'm off my nut, or he is.

1829
01:46:31,955 --> 01:46:33,163
... or you are.

1830
01:46:33,939 --> 01:46:35,402
It isn't me!

1831
01:46:35,402 --> 01:46:39,019
Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. 
Well, come on, Gabriel.

1832
01:46:39,019 --> 01:46:41,256
- Clarence!
- Clarence! Clarence!

1833
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:48,356
That's all right. Go on in.

1834
01:46:48,356 --> 01:46:51,486
Martini is a friend of mine.

1835
01:46:51,486 --> 01:46:53,420
There's a place to sit down, sit down.

1836
01:47:00,472 --> 01:47:03,101
Oh, hello, Nick. 
Hey, where's Martini?

1837
01:47:03,101 --> 01:47:04,993
- You want a Martini?
- No, no, Martini.

1838
01:47:04,993 --> 01:47:07,329
- Your boss. Where is he?
- Look, I'm the boss.

1839
01:47:07,329 --> 01:47:08,633
You want a drink or don't you?

1840
01:47:08,633 --> 01:47:10,996
Okay, all right. Double bourbon, 
will you? Quick, huh.

1841
01:47:10,996 --> 01:47:12,182
Okay.

1842
01:47:15,398 --> 01:47:16,975
What's yours?

1843
01:47:16,975 --> 01:47:18,569
I was just thinking.

1844
01:47:18,569 --> 01:47:22,278
Uh ... It's been so long 
since I ...

1845
01:47:22,278 --> 01:47:25,815
Look, Mister, I'm standing here waiting 
for you to make up your mind.

1846
01:47:25,815 --> 01:47:27,461
That's a good man.

1847
01:47:27,461 --> 01:47:34,171
I was just thinking, uh, 
of a flaming rum punch.

1848
01:47:34,171 --> 01:47:36,665
No, it's not cold enough for that. 
Not nearly cold enough.

1849
01:47:36,665 --> 01:47:37,932
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1850
01:47:37,932 --> 01:47:39,851
I got it.

1851
01:47:39,851 --> 01:47:43,471
Mulled wine, heavy on the cinnamon 
and light on the cloves.

1852
01:47:43,471 --> 01:47:45,423
Off with you, me lad, and be lively!

1853
01:47:45,423 --> 01:47:50,392
Hey, look, Mister, we serve hard drinks 
in here for men who want to get drunk fast.

1854
01:47:50,392 --> 01:47:55,221
And we don't need any characters around 
to give the joint atmosphere. Is that clear?

1855
01:47:55,221 --> 01:47:57,906
Or do I have to slip you 
my left for a convincer?

1856
01:47:57,906 --> 01:47:59,050
What's he talking about?

1857
01:47:59,050 --> 01:48:04,546
Nick, Nick, just give him 
the same as mine. He's okay.

1858
01:48:04,546 --> 01:48:05,744
Okay.

1859
01:48:07,152 --> 01:48:08,596
What's the matter with him?

1860
01:48:08,596 --> 01:48:10,750
I never saw Nick act like that before.

1861
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:14,169
You'll see a lot of strange 
things from now on.

1862
01:48:14,169 --> 01:48:15,612
Oh, yeah.

1863
01:48:16,918 --> 01:48:22,349
Hey, li-li-little fellow, 
you worry me.

1864
01:48:22,349 --> 01:48:25,845
- You know, y-y-you got someplace to sleep?
- No.

1865
01:48:25,845 --> 01:48:27,491
You don't, huh?

1866
01:48:27,491 --> 01:48:31,079
- Well, y-y-you got any money?
- No.

1867
01:48:31,079 --> 01:48:32,666
No wonder you jumped in the river.

1868
01:48:32,666 --> 01:48:36,269
I jumped in the river to save you 
so I could get my wings.

1869
01:48:36,269 --> 01:48:38,311
- Oh, that's right.
- Oh-oh.

1870
01:48:40,316 --> 01:48:42,408
- Somebody's just made it.
- Made what?

1871
01:48:42,408 --> 01:48:46,917
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means 
that some angel's just got his wings.

1872
01:48:52,247 --> 01:48:59,584
Look, I think maybe you better not 
mention getting your wings around here.

1873
01:48:59,584 --> 01:49:02,150
Why? 
Don't they believe in angels?

1874
01:49:02,150 --> 01:49:05,744
A ... Yeah, 
they believe in angels.

1875
01:49:05,744 --> 01:49:08,615
Oh, oh! Why should they be 
surprised when they see one?

1876
01:49:11,372 --> 01:49:15,098
Aw, he never grew up. He's ...

1877
01:49:15,098 --> 01:49:17,051
How old are you, anyway, Clarence?

1878
01:49:17,051 --> 01:49:22,311
Two hundred and ninety-three, 
uh, next May.

1879
01:49:22,970 --> 01:49:24,426
That does it!

1880
01:49:24,426 --> 01:49:27,860
Out you two pixies go, 
through the door or out the window.

1881
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:29,080
Look, Nick, what's wrong?

1882
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:32,055
And that's another thing. 
Where do you come off calling me Nick?

1883
01:49:32,055 --> 01:49:33,599
Well, Nick, that's your name.

1884
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:37,888
What's that got to do with it? 
I don't know you from Adam's off ox.

1885
01:49:37,888 --> 01:49:40,488
Hey! Hey, you, rummy there! 
Come here! Come here!

1886
01:49:44,286 --> 01:49:47,403
Didn't I tell you never to come 
panhandling around here, huh?

1887
01:49:54,956 --> 01:49:56,352
Mr. Gower!

1888
01:49:57,539 --> 01:49:58,773
Mr. Gower!

1889
01:50:00,506 --> 01:50:02,612
What ... what is he ...

1890
01:50:02,612 --> 01:50:05,042
Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey!

1891
01:50:06,365 --> 01:50:11,407
- Don't you know me?
- No. No.

1892
01:50:11,407 --> 01:50:12,898
Throw 'em out. Throw 'em out!

1893
01:50:12,898 --> 01:50:16,097
Mr. Gower ... Hey, what is ...

1894
01:50:16,097 --> 01:50:18,475
Hey, Nick, Nick ... 
Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist?

1895
01:50:18,475 --> 01:50:20,614
You know, that's another reason 
for me not to like you.

1896
01:50:20,614 --> 01:50:24,152
That rum head spent twenty years 
in jail for poisoning a kid.

1897
01:50:24,152 --> 01:50:26,598
If you know him, you must be 
a jailbird yourself.

1898
01:50:26,598 --> 01:50:29,299
Uh, would you show these 
gentlemen to the door?

1899
01:50:29,299 --> 01:50:31,253
Sure. This way, gentlemen.

1900
01:50:37,010 --> 01:50:38,906
Stay out! Stay out!

1901
01:50:38,906 --> 01:50:40,141
Hey! Get me!

1902
01:50:40,611 --> 01:50:42,103
I'm giving out wings!

1903
01:50:44,602 --> 01:50:46,228
You see, George, you were not there

1904
01:50:46,228 --> 01:50:48,761
to stop Gower from putting 
that poison into the capsule ...

1905
01:50:48,761 --> 01:50:50,016
What do you mean I wasn't there?

1906
01:50:50,016 --> 01:50:54,730
I remember distinctly. What the ...

1907
01:50:54,730 --> 01:50:57,552
hey, what's going on around here?

1908
01:50:57,552 --> 01:51:02,252
Why, this ought to be Martini's place.

1909
01:51:08,636 --> 01:51:10,428
Look, who are you?

1910
01:51:10,428 --> 01:51:13,067
I told you, George. 
I'm your guardian angel.

1911
01:51:13,067 --> 01:51:14,755
Yeah, yeah, I know. 
You told me that.

1912
01:51:20,938 --> 01:51:23,155
What else are you? What are you?

1913
01:51:23,155 --> 01:51:25,261
- You are hypnotist?
- No, of course not.

1914
01:51:25,261 --> 01:51:28,131
Well, then why am I seeing 
all these strange things?

1915
01:51:28,131 --> 01:51:30,322
Don't you understand, George?

1916
01:51:30,322 --> 01:51:32,598
It's because you were not born.

1917
01:51:32,598 --> 01:51:34,330
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?

1918
01:51:34,330 --> 01:51:37,158
You're nobody. You have no identity.

1919
01:51:37,158 --> 01:51:39,585
Oh, what do you mean, no identity? 
My name's George Bailey.

1920
01:51:39,585 --> 01:51:41,641
There is no George Bailey.

1921
01:51:42,946 --> 01:51:51,457
You have no papers, no cards, no driver's 
license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy.

1922
01:51:51,457 --> 01:51:53,259
They're not there, either.

1923
01:51:54,669 --> 01:51:57,545
- What?
- Zuzu's petals.

1924
01:52:02,550 --> 01:52:05,388
You've been given a great gift, George ...

1925
01:52:05,388 --> 01:52:08,790
a chance to see what the world 
would be like without you.

1926
01:52:11,303 --> 01:52:14,207
Now wait a minute here. 
Wait a minute here.

1927
01:52:15,888 --> 01:52:19,289
Aw, this is some sort of a 
funny dream I'm having here.

1928
01:52:19,289 --> 01:52:21,206
So long, Mister, I — I'm going home.

1929
01:52:21,206 --> 01:52:23,760
- Home? What home?
- Now shut up! Cut it out!

1930
01:52:24,606 --> 01:52:27,318
You're — You're — You're crazy. 
That's what I think.

1931
01:52:27,318 --> 01:52:30,422
You're — You're screwy 
and you're driving me crazy, too!

1932
01:52:30,422 --> 01:52:31,830
I'm seeing things here.

1933
01:52:31,830 --> 01:52:33,869
I'm going home 
and see my wife and family.

1934
01:52:33,869 --> 01:52:36,242
You understand that? 
And I'm going home alone!

1935
01:52:39,494 --> 01:52:42,978
How am I doing, Joseph? Thanks.

1936
01:52:43,613 --> 01:52:45,327
No, I didn't have a drink!

1937
01:53:36,109 --> 01:53:37,940
Hey, hey.

1938
01:53:37,940 --> 01:53:40,482
- Where did the Building and Loan move to?
- The building and what?

1939
01:53:40,482 --> 01:53:42,178
The Bailey Building and Loan. 
It was up there.

1940
01:53:42,178 --> 01:53:44,379
They went out of business years ago.

1941
01:53:44,379 --> 01:53:46,159
That guy is a liar!

1942
01:53:46,159 --> 01:53:48,165
I know everything's shot in this town.

1943
01:53:48,165 --> 01:53:52,285
- I know ...
- Hey, Violet.

1944
01:53:53,523 --> 01:53:56,327
Hey, listen, that's Violet Bick!

1945
01:53:56,327 --> 01:53:58,441
- I know. I know.
- I know that girl.

1946
01:53:58,441 --> 01:54:00,016
Take a walk. Beat it.

1947
01:54:02,346 --> 01:54:04,195
Hey, Ernie, Ernie ...

1948
01:54:06,184 --> 01:54:08,332
Ernie, take me home. 
I've gone off my nut!

1949
01:54:08,332 --> 01:54:09,885
- Where do you live?
- Aw, now, doggone it,

1950
01:54:09,885 --> 01:54:11,325
Ernie, don't you start 
pulling that stuff.

1951
01:54:11,325 --> 01:54:13,250
You know where I live. 
Three-twenty Sycamore.

1952
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:15,798
- Now hurry up.
- Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore?

1953
01:54:15,798 --> 01:54:18,945
- Yeah, yeah, hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
- All right. All right.

1954
01:54:20,009 --> 01:54:22,081
Look here, Ernie, 
straighten me out here.

1955
01:54:22,081 --> 01:54:23,815
Look, I — I've got some bad liquor 
or something.

1956
01:54:23,815 --> 01:54:26,274
I want you to listen to me. 
Now, you are Ernie Bishop,

1957
01:54:26,274 --> 01:54:29,213
and you live in Bailey Park with your 
wife and kid? That's right, isn't it?

1958
01:54:29,213 --> 01:54:30,296
You seen my wife?

1959
01:54:30,296 --> 01:54:33,787
Seen your wife! I've been to 
your house a hundred times.

1960
01:54:33,787 --> 01:54:35,075
Look, bud, what's the idea?

1961
01:54:35,075 --> 01:54:38,743
I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife 
ran away three years ago and took the kid ...

1962
01:54:38,743 --> 01:54:41,360
And I ain't never seen you 
before in my life, see?

1963
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:43,812
Okay. Just step on it. 
Just get me home.

1964
01:55:01,929 --> 01:55:03,963
- Is this the place?
- Of course, it's the place.

1965
01:55:03,963 --> 01:55:06,729
Well, this house ain't been 
lived in for twenty years.

1966
01:55:13,337 --> 01:55:14,440
What's up, Ernie?

1967
01:55:14,440 --> 01:55:16,833
I don't know, but we'd better keep 
our eye on this guy.

1968
01:55:16,833 --> 01:55:17,843
He's bats.

1969
01:55:36,004 --> 01:55:38,404
Mary! Mary!

1970
01:55:41,226 --> 01:55:44,517
Tommy! Pete! Janie! Zuzu! 
Where are you?

1971
01:55:44,517 --> 01:55:47,286
They're not here, George. 
You have no children.

1972
01:55:47,286 --> 01:55:48,693
Where are they? 
What have you done with them?

1973
01:55:48,693 --> 01:55:50,995
All right, put up your hands. 
No fast moves.

1974
01:55:50,995 --> 01:55:52,580
Come on out here, both of you.

1975
01:55:52,580 --> 01:55:54,224
Bert! Thank heaven, you're here.

1976
01:55:54,224 --> 01:55:56,918
- Stand back!
- Bert, what's happened to this house?

1977
01:55:56,918 --> 01:55:58,445
Wh-Where's Mary? Where's my kids?

1978
01:55:58,445 --> 01:55:59,540
Watch him, Bert.

1979
01:55:59,540 --> 01:56:00,860
- Come on, come on.
- Bert, Ernie!

1980
01:56:00,860 --> 01:56:02,316
What's the matter with you two guys?

1981
01:56:02,316 --> 01:56:04,064
You — You — You were here 
on my wedding night.

1982
01:56:04,064 --> 01:56:07,021
You, both of you, stood out there on the 
porch and sung to us, don't you remember?

1983
01:56:07,021 --> 01:56:08,154
- Think I'd better be going.
- Look,

1984
01:56:08,154 --> 01:56:10,448
now why don't you be a good kid 
and we'll take you into a doctor.

1985
01:56:10,448 --> 01:56:12,251
- Everything's gonna be all right. Now ...
- Bert, now listen to me.

1986
01:56:12,251 --> 01:56:14,480
Ernie, will you take me over 
to my mother's house?

1987
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:16,073
Bert! Listen! 
It's that fellow there.

1988
01:56:16,073 --> 01:56:18,276
He says he's an angel. 
He's tried to hypnotize me.

1989
01:56:18,276 --> 01:56:20,314
I hate to do this, fella, but ...

1990
01:56:21,983 --> 01:56:23,752
Run, George! Run, George!

1991
01:56:23,752 --> 01:56:27,570
Help! Joseph, help!

1992
01:56:27,570 --> 01:56:32,281
- Oh, shut up!
- Help, oh, Joseph, Joseph!

1993
01:56:37,933 --> 01:56:40,870
Where'd he go? Where'd he go? 
I had him right here.

1994
01:56:43,983 --> 01:56:45,081
I need a drink.

1995
01:56:45,996 --> 01:56:48,016
Well, which way'd they go? 
Help me find 'em.

1996
01:56:58,588 --> 01:56:59,854
Well?

1997
01:57:03,069 --> 01:57:04,134
Mother.

1998
01:57:06,156 --> 01:57:08,187
Mother? What do you want?

1999
01:57:09,324 --> 01:57:14,162
Mother, this is, this is George. 
I — I thought sure you'd remember me.

2000
01:57:14,162 --> 01:57:15,719
George who?

2001
01:57:15,719 --> 01:57:17,240
If you're looking for a room, 
there's no vacancy.

2002
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:19,396
Oh, Mother, listen. Please help me.

2003
01:57:19,396 --> 01:57:20,670
Something terrible's happened to me.

2004
01:57:20,670 --> 01:57:23,460
I — I — I don't know what it is. 
Something's happened to everybody.

2005
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:25,092
Please let me come in.

2006
01:57:25,092 --> 01:57:27,552
- Keep me here until I get over it.
- Get over what?

2007
01:57:27,552 --> 01:57:30,972
I don't take in strangers unless 
they're sent here by somebody I know.

2008
01:57:30,972 --> 01:57:34,739
What? 
Look, I know everybody you know.

2009
01:57:34,739 --> 01:57:36,916
What do you ... 
Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.

2010
01:57:36,916 --> 01:57:38,780
- You know him?
- Well, sure I do.

2011
01:57:38,780 --> 01:57:41,073
- When'd you see him last?
- Today over at his house.

2012
01:57:41,073 --> 01:57:42,191
That's a lie.

2013
01:57:42,191 --> 01:57:45,199
He's been in the insane asylum 
ever since he lost his business.

2014
01:57:45,199 --> 01:57:47,069
And if you ask me, 
that's where you belong.

2015
01:58:00,005 --> 01:58:02,112
Strange, isn't it?

2016
01:58:02,112 --> 01:58:05,582
Each man's life touches 
so many other lives ...

2017
01:58:05,582 --> 01:58:08,525
and when he isn't around he leaves 
an awful hole, doesn't he?

2018
01:58:08,525 --> 01:58:09,709
I've heard of things like this.

2019
01:58:09,709 --> 01:58:11,439
You've got me in some kind of a spell, 
or something.

2020
01:58:11,439 --> 01:58:13,867
Well, I'm going to get out of it. 
I'll get out of it.

2021
01:58:13,867 --> 01:58:15,939
I know how, too. 
I ...

2022
01:58:15,939 --> 01:58:19,505
The last man I talked to before all this 
stuff started happening to me was Martini.

2023
01:58:19,505 --> 01:58:20,505
You know where he lives?

2024
01:58:20,505 --> 01:58:22,708
Sure I know where he lives. 
He lives in Bailey Park.

2025
01:58:27,474 --> 01:58:29,909
Are you sure this is Bailey Park?

2026
01:58:29,909 --> 01:58:32,614
Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore.

2027
01:58:32,614 --> 01:58:35,022
All I know is this should be Bailey Park.

2028
01:58:36,328 --> 01:58:37,974
But where are the houses?

2029
01:58:37,974 --> 01:58:39,664
You weren't here to build them.

2030
01:58:44,601 --> 01:58:46,502
Your brother, Harry Bailey,

2031
01:58:46,502 --> 01:58:49,630
broke through the ice 
and was drowned at the age of nine.

2032
01:58:49,630 --> 01:58:51,778
That's a lie. 
Harry Bailey went to war!

2033
01:58:51,778 --> 01:58:53,169
He got the Congressional 
Medal of Honor!

2034
01:58:53,169 --> 01:58:55,298
He saved the lives of every man 
on that transport.

2035
01:58:55,298 --> 01:58:57,455
Every man on that transport died.

2036
01:58:57,455 --> 01:59:01,337
Harry wasn't there to save them, 
because you weren't there to save Harry.

2037
01:59:12,874 --> 01:59:16,907
You see, George, you really 
had a wonderful life.

2038
01:59:16,907 --> 01:59:21,227
Don't you see what a mistake 
it would be to throw it away?

2039
01:59:21,635 --> 01:59:24,525
- Clarence ...
- Yes, George?

2040
01:59:24,525 --> 01:59:27,841
- Where's Mary?
- Oh, well, I — I — I can't do ...

2041
01:59:27,841 --> 01:59:29,201
I don't know how 
you know these things,

2042
01:59:29,201 --> 01:59:30,405
- but tell me, where is she?
- I ...

2043
01:59:30,405 --> 01:59:32,392
If you know where she is, 
tell me where my wife is.

2044
01:59:32,392 --> 01:59:33,662
I'm not supposed to tell.

2045
01:59:33,662 --> 01:59:35,529
Please, Clarence, 
tell me where she is.

2046
01:59:35,529 --> 01:59:37,872
- You're not going to like it, George.
- Where is she?

2047
01:59:37,872 --> 01:59:40,282
She's an old maid. 
She never married.

2048
01:59:40,282 --> 01:59:41,868
Where's Mary, where is she?

2049
01:59:41,868 --> 01:59:42,874
- She is ...
- Where is she?

2050
01:59:42,874 --> 01:59:45,803
She's just about 
to close up the library!

2051
01:59:48,863 --> 01:59:53,252
Aw, there must be some easier way 
for me to get my wings.

2052
02:00:04,567 --> 02:00:05,699
Mary!

2053
02:00:11,253 --> 02:00:12,340
Mary!

2054
02:00:14,971 --> 02:00:19,211
Mary, Mary, Mary ...

2055
02:00:19,211 --> 02:00:20,274
Mary, it's George.

2056
02:00:20,274 --> 02:00:21,764
Don't you know me? 
What's happened to us?

2057
02:00:21,764 --> 02:00:23,752
- I don't know you, let me go!
- Mary, please!

2058
02:00:23,752 --> 02:00:26,352
Oh, don't do this to me. 
Please, Mary, help me.

2059
02:00:26,352 --> 02:00:28,342
Where's our kids? I need you, Mary!

2060
02:00:29,221 --> 02:00:32,133
Help me, Mary! Mary ...

2061
02:00:32,133 --> 02:00:33,192
Let me go!

2062
02:00:35,256 --> 02:00:38,938
- Mary, don't run away!
- That man, stop him!

2063
02:00:38,938 --> 02:00:40,822
Tom! Ed!

2064
02:00:40,822 --> 02:00:43,621
Charlie! That's my wife!

2065
02:00:46,104 --> 02:00:47,720
- Mary!
- Oh, no, you don't!

2066
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:50,199
- Somebody call the police!
- Hit him with a bottle!

2067
02:00:50,199 --> 02:00:52,207
He needs a straight jacket.

2068
02:00:52,610 --> 02:00:54,630
Mary! Clarence!

2069
02:00:55,392 --> 02:00:56,937
Get out of here!

2070
02:00:56,937 --> 02:01:01,038
- Clarence! 
- Where are you?

2071
02:01:01,038 --> 02:01:02,427
Oh, it's you!

2072
02:01:05,744 --> 02:01:06,980
Stand back!

2073
02:01:21,107 --> 02:01:22,326
Clarence!

2074
02:01:27,349 --> 02:01:29,980
Clarence! Clarence!

2075
02:01:31,201 --> 02:01:32,522
Help me, Clarence.

2076
02:01:33,998 --> 02:01:35,133
Get me back.

2077
02:01:36,268 --> 02:01:38,479
Get me back. 
I don't care what happens to me.

2078
02:01:39,545 --> 02:01:41,531
Get me back to my wife and kids.

2079
02:01:42,069 --> 02:01:43,528
Help me, Clarence, please.

2080
02:01:44,681 --> 02:01:48,060
Please! I want to live again.

2081
02:01:48,060 --> 02:01:49,619
I want to live again.

2082
02:01:51,078 --> 02:01:52,714
I want to live again.

2083
02:01:52,714 --> 02:01:55,328
Please, God, let me live again.

2084
02:02:04,086 --> 02:02:05,151
Hey, George.

2085
02:02:06,952 --> 02:02:08,115
George!

2086
02:02:09,153 --> 02:02:11,240
You all right. 
Hey, what's the matter?

2087
02:02:11,240 --> 02:02:13,667
Now get out of here, Bert 
or I'll hit you again! Get out!

2088
02:02:13,667 --> 02:02:15,603
What the Sam Hill you, 
you yelling for, George!

2089
02:02:15,603 --> 02:02:20,216
You ... George?

2090
02:02:20,216 --> 02:02:21,623
Bert, do you know me?

2091
02:02:21,623 --> 02:02:23,692
Know you? Hum, are you kidding'?

2092
02:02:23,692 --> 02:02:25,905
I've been looking all over town, 
trying to find you.

2093
02:02:25,905 --> 02:02:28,949
I saw your car piled into that tree 
down there, and I thought maybe you ...

2094
02:02:28,949 --> 02:02:31,328
Hey, your mouth's bleeding. 
Are you sure you're all right?

2095
02:02:31,328 --> 02:02:32,494
What did you ...

2096
02:02:36,754 --> 02:02:40,150
My mouth's bleeding, Bert! 
My mouth's bleed ...

2097
02:02:40,150 --> 02:02:43,305
Zuzu's petals, Zuzu's ... 
There they are!

2098
02:02:43,305 --> 02:02:46,221
Bert! What do you know about that?

2099
02:02:46,221 --> 02:02:48,693
Merry Christmas!

2100
02:02:48,693 --> 02:02:50,528
Well, Merry Christmas!

2101
02:02:50,528 --> 02:02:51,593
Mary!

2102
02:02:52,540 --> 02:02:53,794
Mary!

2103
02:02:55,100 --> 02:02:57,410
Yaa!

2104
02:03:01,001 --> 02:03:02,392
Yaa!

2105
02:03:02,392 --> 02:03:04,789
Hello, Bedford Falls!

2106
02:03:07,322 --> 02:03:10,553
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

2107
02:03:10,553 --> 02:03:12,596
Merry Christmas, George!

2108
02:03:12,596 --> 02:03:15,543
Merry Christmas, movie house!

2109
02:03:15,543 --> 02:03:19,013
Merry Christmas, Emporium!

2110
02:03:19,013 --> 02:03:22,993
Merry Christmas, 
you wonderful old Building and Loan!

2111
02:03:27,148 --> 02:03:30,600
Hey! Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!

2112
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:33,406
Happy New Year to you ... in jail.

2113
02:03:33,406 --> 02:03:35,659
Go on home. 
They're waiting for you.

2114
02:03:37,195 --> 02:03:38,345
Mary!

2115
02:03:38,884 --> 02:03:40,000
Mary!

2116
02:03:41,767 --> 02:03:43,002
Mary!

2117
02:03:43,830 --> 02:03:46,850
Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner. 
How are you?

2118
02:03:46,850 --> 02:03:49,117
- Mr. Bailey, there's a deficit.
- I know. Eight thousand dollars.

2119
02:03:49,117 --> 02:03:50,405
George, I've got a little paper here.

2120
02:03:50,405 --> 02:03:52,555
I'll bet it's a warrant for 
my arrest. Isn't it wonderful?

2121
02:03:52,555 --> 02:03:53,620
I'm going to jail.

2122
02:03:53,620 --> 02:03:54,809
Merry Christmas! Reporters?

2123
02:03:54,809 --> 02:03:56,132
Wh-Where's Mary?

2124
02:03:56,132 --> 02:03:59,050
Mary! Oh, look at this 
wonderful old drafty house.

2125
02:03:59,050 --> 02:04:03,879
Mary! Mary! Mary!

2126
02:04:04,448 --> 02:04:06,257
Have you ... Have you seen my wife?

2127
02:04:06,257 --> 02:04:09,129
- Merry Christmas, Daddy! 
- Merry Christmas, Daddy!

2128
02:04:09,129 --> 02:04:11,799
Kids! Pete!

2129
02:04:11,799 --> 02:04:13,376
Oh!

2130
02:04:15,875 --> 02:04:18,914
Kids! Janie! Janie! Tommy!

2131
02:04:20,967 --> 02:04:22,254
Oh, let me look at you.

2132
02:04:22,254 --> 02:04:23,757
Oh, I could eat you up.

2133
02:04:24,722 --> 02:04:27,443
- Where is your mother?
- She went looking for you with Uncle Billy.

2134
02:04:27,443 --> 02:04:29,796
- Daddy!
- Zuzu! Zuzu!

2135
02:04:29,796 --> 02:04:31,917
My little gingersnap! 
How do you feel?

2136
02:04:31,917 --> 02:04:35,990
- Fine! Not a smitch of temperature.
- Not a smitch of tempe ...

2137
02:04:35,990 --> 02:04:37,395
Hallelujah!

2138
02:04:38,631 --> 02:04:40,325
- George! George!
- Mary! Mary!

2139
02:04:40,325 --> 02:04:41,819
George, darling! 
Where have you been?

2140
02:04:41,819 --> 02:04:44,214
George, darling! 
Where have you been?

2141
02:04:44,214 --> 02:04:49,035
- Oh, George, George, George.
- Mary! Let me touch you.

2142
02:04:49,035 --> 02:04:51,922
Let me touch you. 
Oh, you're real!

2143
02:04:51,922 --> 02:04:54,640
Oh, George ... George.

2144
02:04:54,640 --> 02:04:56,523
You have no idea 
what happened to me.

2145
02:04:56,523 --> 02:04:58,886
You have no idea what happened.

2146
02:04:58,886 --> 02:05:02,306
Well, well, come on, George, come on 
downstairs, quick. They're on their way.

2147
02:05:02,306 --> 02:05:03,984
- All right.
- Come on!

2148
02:05:06,689 --> 02:05:08,538
Come on in here now.

2149
02:05:09,503 --> 02:05:13,573
Now, you stand right over here, by the tree. 
Right there, and don't move, don't move.

2150
02:05:13,573 --> 02:05:15,696
What's happening? Who's gonna come?

2151
02:05:15,696 --> 02:05:18,690
I hear 'em coming now, George, 
it's a miracle!

2152
02:05:18,690 --> 02:05:21,912
- It's a miracle!
- Who's coming?

2153
02:05:21,912 --> 02:05:22,912
Who's gonna come, Daddy?

2154
02:05:22,912 --> 02:05:24,129
- Who, Daddy?
- I don't know.

2155
02:05:24,129 --> 02:05:27,631
Come in, Uncle Billy. 
Everybody! In here!

2156
02:05:34,066 --> 02:05:36,233
Isn't it wonderful? 
So many faces!

2157
02:05:36,233 --> 02:05:37,377
Mary did it, George! Mary did it!

2158
02:05:37,377 --> 02:05:39,270
She told some people 
you were in trouble and then,

2159
02:05:39,270 --> 02:05:41,349
they scattered all over town 
collecting money.

2160
02:05:41,349 --> 02:05:44,189
They didn't ask any questions — just said: 
"If George is in trouble, count me in ...

2161
02:05:44,189 --> 02:05:47,689
What is this, George? 
Another run on the bank?

2162
02:05:48,296 --> 02:05:50,187
Here you are, George, 
Merry Christmas.

2163
02:05:52,834 --> 02:05:57,264
The line forms on the right.

2164
02:05:57,264 --> 02:05:59,692
Merry Christmas! God bless you.

2165
02:06:02,862 --> 02:06:06,160
- Oh, Mr. Martini! 
- Merry Christmas!

2166
02:06:06,160 --> 02:06:08,622
Step right up here.

2167
02:06:08,622 --> 02:06:10,945
I busted the jukebox, too!

2168
02:06:14,055 --> 02:06:15,476
Mr. Gower!

2169
02:06:18,062 --> 02:06:20,143
I made the rounds of all my charge accounts.

2170
02:06:27,997 --> 02:06:30,965
- Violet Bick!
- I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.

2171
02:06:36,950 --> 02:06:40,951
I've been saving this money for 
a divorce, if ever I get a husband.

2172
02:06:45,897 --> 02:06:49,366
There you are, George. I got 
the faculty all up out of bed.

2173
02:06:49,366 --> 02:06:51,389
And here's something 
for you to play with.

2174
02:06:53,156 --> 02:06:56,379
I wouldn't have a roof over my head 
if it wasn't for you, George.

2175
02:06:56,379 --> 02:06:57,800
Just a minute. Just a minute.

2176
02:06:57,800 --> 02:06:59,977
Quiet, everybody. 
Quiet, quiet.

2177
02:06:59,977 --> 02:07:03,065
- I just got this. It's from London.
- Oh.

2178
02:07:03,065 --> 02:07:05,872
Mr. Gower cabled you need cash. Stop.

2179
02:07:05,872 --> 02:07:10,245
My office instructed to advance you 
up to twenty-five thousand dollars. Stop.

2180
02:07:10,245 --> 02:07:13,269
Hee-haw and Merry Christmas. 
Sam Wainwright.

2181
