1
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:02,118
Dad.

2
00:04:47,807 --> 00:04:52,062
Clear the ramp! 30 seconds!
God be with you!

3
00:04:52,145 --> 00:04:57,400
Port side stick, starboard side stick,
move fast and clear those murder holes.

4
00:04:57,484 --> 00:04:59,819
I want to see plenty of beach
between men.

5
00:04:59,903 --> 00:05:03,823
Five men is a juicy opportunity.
One man is a waste of ammo.

6
00:05:03,907 --> 00:05:06,034
Keep the sand out of your weapons.

7
00:05:06,117 --> 00:05:10,538
Keep those actions clear.
And I'll see you on the beach.

8
00:05:42,654 --> 00:05:44,864
Clear the murder holes!

9
00:06:01,214 --> 00:06:02,799
Over the side!

10
00:06:09,306 --> 00:06:11,683
Port and starboard, over...

11
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:22,170
Jesus.

12
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:24,381
Thank you...

13
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,356
I said, what the hell do we do now, sir?

14
00:09:47,774 --> 00:09:51,027
Captain Miller! Captain Miller!

15
00:09:52,654 --> 00:09:55,824
- Captain Miller!
- Sergeant Horvath!

16
00:09:57,409 --> 00:10:01,079
Move your men off the beach! Go!

17
00:10:01,162 --> 00:10:02,497
Okay, you guys!

18
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,625
- Get on my ass! Follow me!
- Sir!

19
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:08,044
What's the rallying point?

20
00:10:08,128 --> 00:10:09,963
Anywhere but here!

21
00:10:23,018 --> 00:10:25,520
The seawall! Move up to the seawall!

22
00:10:25,604 --> 00:10:27,897
Sir, I'm staying!

23
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:30,275
Clear this beach!
Make way for the others!

24
00:10:30,358 --> 00:10:32,944
This is all we got
between us and the Almighty.

25
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:37,032
Every inch of this beach
has been pre-sighted!

26
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:41,244
You stay here, you're dead men!

27
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:58,011
Mama! Mama!

28
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:05,143
Stay down! Stay down!

29
00:11:09,814 --> 00:11:11,149
What are you guys?

30
00:11:11,232 --> 00:11:13,944
104th Medical Battalion, sir!

31
00:11:14,027 --> 00:11:16,696
Here to set up field operations!

32
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,323
Get rid of that crap!

33
00:11:18,406 --> 00:11:21,493
Grab yourselves some weapons.
Follow me.

34
00:11:29,084 --> 00:11:32,003
- I'm hit! I'm hit!
- Briggs!

35
00:11:36,174 --> 00:11:40,470
Get me out of here. I'm hit low. God!

36
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:43,640
- Medic!
- Navy Beach Battalion, sir.

37
00:11:43,723 --> 00:11:47,435
I gotta clear these obstacles,
make holes for the tanks.

38
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,854
All the armour is foundering
in the Channel.

39
00:11:49,938 --> 00:11:53,191
Orders, sir. You go somewhere else.
I'm clearing this one!

40
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:55,068
Come on, Briggs!

41
00:11:59,656 --> 00:12:01,032
Medic!

42
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:39,738
Move! Move!

43
00:12:47,412 --> 00:12:50,540
Move! Come on! Move!

44
00:13:12,312 --> 00:13:15,649
Shore party.
No armour has made it ashore.

45
00:13:15,732 --> 00:13:20,445
We got no DD tanks on the beach.
Dog One is not open.

46
00:13:21,404 --> 00:13:25,033
- Who's in command here?
- You are, sir!

47
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,120
- Sergeant Horvath!
- Sir!

48
00:13:29,204 --> 00:13:31,247
You recognise where we are?

49
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:33,750
Right where we're supposed to be,
but no one else is!

50
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:37,295
Nobody's where they're supposed to be.

51
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:38,964
Shore party.

52
00:13:39,756 --> 00:13:42,008
First wave, ineffective.

53
00:13:42,092 --> 00:13:46,137
We do not hold the beach.
Say again, we do not hold the beach.

54
00:13:46,513 --> 00:13:47,889
We're all mixed up, sir.

55
00:13:47,973 --> 00:13:49,766
We got the leftovers from Fox Company,

56
00:13:49,849 --> 00:13:51,810
Able Company and George Company!

57
00:13:51,893 --> 00:13:55,522
Plus we got some Navy demo guys
and a beachmaster!

58
00:13:57,065 --> 00:14:00,068
Shore party. Shore party.

59
00:14:06,157 --> 00:14:08,493
CATF, CATF...

60
00:14:11,997 --> 00:14:14,291
- Reiben here, sir!
- Did you see anybody else?

61
00:14:14,374 --> 00:14:17,168
- Jackson, but that's about it.
- Mellish here.

62
00:14:17,252 --> 00:14:20,505
Caparzo! We got DeForest
back there with Wade.

63
00:14:20,588 --> 00:14:24,342
He's hurt so bad he says
he sprung 100 leaks.

64
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:26,094
Wade says he's all used up.

65
00:14:26,177 --> 00:14:28,430
- Move on to somebody you can help.
- Let's go!

66
00:14:28,513 --> 00:14:30,974
He's battalion surgeon, sir!

67
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,980
- Get his attention.
- Wade!

68
00:14:37,063 --> 00:14:38,565
- Yo, Doc!
- Wade!

69
00:14:38,648 --> 00:14:41,818
- Wade! Wade! Wade!
- Wade!

70
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:46,156
- Wade! Wade! Wade!
- Too risky, Doc. Too risky.

71
00:14:47,616 --> 00:14:49,701
- Wade!
- All right. Get him off the beach.

72
00:14:49,784 --> 00:14:53,538
I got it! We stopped the bleeding!
We stopped the bleeding!

73
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:56,708
Fuck!

74
00:14:56,791 --> 00:15:00,086
Just give us a fucking chance,
you son of a bitch!

75
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,589
- Son of a fucking cocksucker!
- Wade! Come on. Come on.

76
00:15:02,672 --> 00:15:05,884
Wade! It's Mellish! Wade!

77
00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:08,094
- Mellish!
- Let's go!

78
00:15:08,178 --> 00:15:09,346
We found Miller!

79
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:12,015
- Fuck it!
- Let's move! Let's move!

80
00:15:19,064 --> 00:15:22,192
This is all? This is all that's made it?

81
00:15:22,275 --> 00:15:25,779
We got scattered pretty bad, sir.
There's bound to be more.

82
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,115
- Not enough. It's not enough.
- Dog One exit...

83
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,575
It's gotta be that cut on the right.

84
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:33,161
- Or is that one on the left? Shit!
- No. No, no, no.

85
00:15:33,244 --> 00:15:35,956
Vierville is to the west of us.
This is Dog One.

86
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,290
They're killing us!

87
00:15:37,374 --> 00:15:41,503
And we don't have a fucking chance,
and that ain't fair!

88
00:15:41,586 --> 00:15:43,964
Gather weapons and ammo!

89
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:45,882
Gather weapons and ammo!

90
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:49,052
Come on, let's drag them in
off the sand!

91
00:15:57,143 --> 00:16:01,064
Reiben. Hey, Reiben, Reiben, Reiben,
where's your BAR?

92
00:16:01,815 --> 00:16:03,942
Bottom of the channel, sir.
The bitch tried to drown me.

93
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:05,902
Find a replacement.

94
00:16:07,946 --> 00:16:10,907
Bangalores! Bring up some bangalores!

95
00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:15,870
Grenades, grenades! Get me
some grenades. Get them over here!

96
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,544
Bangalores up the line!
Bangalores up the line!

97
00:16:22,627 --> 00:16:24,921
Heads up! Bangers coming your way!

98
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:27,424
Come on, come on, come on!

99
00:16:27,507 --> 00:16:30,343
- Jackson here, sir!
- Reiben back, sir!

100
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:33,763
Oh, my God!

101
00:16:36,766 --> 00:16:39,227
One more. Give me one more.

102
00:16:44,566 --> 00:16:47,277
Oh, my God, it hurts! I'm gonna die!

103
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,323
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus! Oh, my God!

104
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:55,869
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.
Almost got it.

105
00:16:55,952 --> 00:16:58,997
- Jesus! Lucky bastard.
- Come on.

106
00:16:59,873 --> 00:17:02,167
- Move it!
- Keep it moving. You got it?

107
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,295
God! God, help me!

108
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,839
You're not gonna die.
You're not gonna die.

109
00:17:07,922 --> 00:17:11,092
You're fine. Don't look at it.
Don't look at it.

110
00:17:11,176 --> 00:17:14,930
Bangalores! Clear the shingle!

111
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:17,682
Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole!

112
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:20,310
Fire in the hole!

113
00:17:21,478 --> 00:17:23,229
Fire in the hole!

114
00:17:32,822 --> 00:17:36,534
We're in business! Defilade!
Other side of the hole!

115
00:17:49,631 --> 00:17:51,925
That's it! Let's go!

116
00:17:55,387 --> 00:17:57,514
Inspected. Morphine.

117
00:18:00,392 --> 00:18:01,768
Routine.

118
00:18:07,816 --> 00:18:09,234
Priority.

119
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:14,572
He's gone.

120
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:28,628
Son of a...

121
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:32,090
- Get in there.
- Fuck. I can't move.

122
00:18:32,173 --> 00:18:33,383
- Mellish.
- Yes, sir.

123
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:35,302
Give me your bayonet.

124
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:59,242
Two MG42s and two mortars.
Add 20, left 30.

125
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,123
There's a little defilade over there,
but it's the perfect fire position

126
00:19:05,206 --> 00:19:06,958
if we get some goddamn armour
on the beach.

127
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:10,086
We gotta open up this draw!
We gotta get this draw open.

128
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,088
Reiben, Mellish, let's get into the war!

129
00:19:12,172 --> 00:19:15,175
Grab some cover
and put some fire on that crew.

130
00:19:15,258 --> 00:19:18,970
Davis, Debernardo,
Young, Valk, get ready.

131
00:19:21,306 --> 00:19:23,016
Covering fire!

132
00:19:26,394 --> 00:19:28,104
Go, go, go!

133
00:19:42,118 --> 00:19:44,079
Goddamn firing squad.

134
00:19:44,162 --> 00:19:47,374
It's the only way we can get
everybody the hell out of here.

135
00:19:47,457 --> 00:19:51,670
Short, Payton, McDonald, Parkes!
You're next!

136
00:19:51,753 --> 00:19:54,381
Why don't we just hand out
blindfolds, Cap?

137
00:19:54,464 --> 00:19:56,049
All we can do here is die.

138
00:19:56,132 --> 00:19:57,676
Covering fire!

139
00:20:00,178 --> 00:20:01,972
Go, go, go!

140
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:04,933
Come on! Come on! Come on!

141
00:20:05,016 --> 00:20:06,893
Go, God damn it!

142
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:21,908
- Jackson.
- Sir.

143
00:20:23,118 --> 00:20:24,703
- Do you see that impact crater?
- Yes, sir.

144
00:20:24,786 --> 00:20:27,163
That should give you complete defilade
from that machine-gun position.

145
00:20:27,247 --> 00:20:29,124
Get in there and give me
some fire discipline.

146
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:31,126
Wait for my command.

147
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,258
Go!

148
00:20:49,311 --> 00:20:52,606
Captain, if your mother saw you do that,
she'd be very upset.

149
00:20:52,689 --> 00:20:54,983
I thought you were my mother.

150
00:20:55,817 --> 00:20:58,528
Be not thou far from me, O Lord.

151
00:21:03,116 --> 00:21:07,120
O my God, I am heartily sorry
for having offended thee.

152
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,582
I detest my sins
for having offended thee, O Lord.

153
00:21:10,665 --> 00:21:12,208
I detest my sins for having
offended thee, O Lord.

154
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:14,336
Listen to me, Lord.

155
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:23,178
All my strength, haste thee to help me.

156
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:43,990
- Dog One exit! Right here!
- We're in business!

157
00:21:45,533 --> 00:21:47,369
Move! Move!

158
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,328
- Reiben.
- Let's go, Sarge. Go!

159
00:22:30,412 --> 00:22:31,705
Reiben.

160
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:58,940
The place is full of 'em!

161
00:23:00,525 --> 00:23:02,152
Come on, Doyle!

162
00:23:03,653 --> 00:23:05,071
Sarge?

163
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:13,496
- Flame!
- Doyle, do it!

164
00:23:18,043 --> 00:23:20,712
Don't shoot! Let them burn!

165
00:23:42,651 --> 00:23:45,987
I'll give you "comrade,"
you son of a bitch!

166
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:47,697
Lie down!

167
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:18,395
Cease fire! Cease fire!

168
00:24:18,478 --> 00:24:21,648
Cut it out! Cut it out! Cease fire!

169
00:24:22,732 --> 00:24:24,442
Sugar Cane. Sugar Charlie 3.

170
00:24:24,526 --> 00:24:27,779
Say again, Dog One is open.
Send in the dozers.

171
00:24:27,862 --> 00:24:30,907
I'm waiting for you
to tie in my flanks. Over.

172
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,410
What?

173
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:39,332
What? I'm sorry, I can't understand
what you're saying.

174
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:49,843
What did he say? What did he say?

175
00:24:49,926 --> 00:24:53,138
"Look, I washed for supper."

176
00:24:57,726 --> 00:24:59,227
God damn it!

177
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,235
- Hey, Fish.
- Yeah?

178
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:09,988
Look at this. A Hitler Youth knife.

179
00:25:11,489 --> 00:25:14,659
And now
it's a Shabbat challah cutter, right?

180
00:25:24,544 --> 00:25:26,212
Keep it moving!

181
00:26:26,481 --> 00:26:28,358
That's quite a view.

182
00:26:29,317 --> 00:26:30,860
Yes, it is.

183
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,114
Quite a view.

184
00:28:08,917 --> 00:28:11,086
<i>"Dear Mr Brian Boyd,</i>

202
00:29:45,931 --> 00:29:47,682
Colonel, I've got something
you should know about.

203
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:49,059
Yes.

204
00:29:51,061 --> 00:29:53,605
These two men died in Normandy.

205
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:57,067
This one at Omaha Beach.

206
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:00,612
- Sean Ryan.
- This man at Utah.

207
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,990
Peter Ryan.

208
00:30:07,744 --> 00:30:10,830
This man was killed
last week in New Guinea.

209
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:16,002
Daniel Ryan.

210
00:30:16,711 --> 00:30:18,630
The three men are brothers, sir.

211
00:30:18,713 --> 00:30:20,173
I've just learned that, this afternoon,

212
00:30:20,256 --> 00:30:24,052
their mother is going
to be getting all three telegrams.

213
00:30:27,013 --> 00:30:29,266
That's not all. There's a fourth brother.
The youngest.

214
00:30:29,349 --> 00:30:31,351
He parachuted in
with the 101st Airborne,

215
00:30:31,434 --> 00:30:32,894
night before the invasion.

216
00:30:32,978 --> 00:30:34,813
He's somewhere in Normandy.
We don't know where.

217
00:30:34,896 --> 00:30:37,315
- Is he alive?
- We don't know.

218
00:30:41,486 --> 00:30:43,113
Come with me.

219
00:32:26,925 --> 00:32:29,302
<i>God damn it.</i>

220
00:32:30,136 --> 00:32:31,972
All four of them
were in the same company

221
00:32:32,055 --> 00:32:34,057
in the 29th Division,
but we split them up

222
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,934
after the Sullivan brothers died
on the Juneau.

223
00:32:36,017 --> 00:32:39,729
Any contact with the fourth son, James?

224
00:32:39,854 --> 00:32:43,817
No, sir. He was dropped about
15 miles inland near Neuville.

225
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,193
But that's still deep
behind German lines.

226
00:32:45,277 --> 00:32:47,487
Now, Mac,
there is no way you can know

227
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,490
where in the hell he was dropped.

228
00:32:50,573 --> 00:32:52,534
General, first reports out of
lke's people at SHAEF

229
00:32:52,617 --> 00:32:54,494
said the 101st is scattered
all to hell and gone.

230
00:32:54,577 --> 00:32:56,955
There's misdrops all over Normandy.

231
00:32:57,038 --> 00:32:59,958
Now, assuming Private Ryan
even survived the jump,

232
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:01,501
he could be anywhere.

233
00:33:01,584 --> 00:33:03,628
In fact, he's probably KIA.

234
00:33:03,712 --> 00:33:07,382
And frankly, sir, we go sending
some sort of rescue mission,

235
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:10,051
flathatting throughout swarms
of German reinforcements

236
00:33:10,135 --> 00:33:13,972
all along our axis of advance,
they're gonna be KIA, too.

237
00:33:36,494 --> 00:33:38,538
I have a letter here,

238
00:33:39,914 --> 00:33:44,002
written a long time ago
to a Mrs Bixby in Boston.

239
00:33:44,085 --> 00:33:46,004
So bear with me.

240
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,383
"Dear Madam,

241
00:33:51,092 --> 00:33:53,345
"I have been shown in the files
of the War Department

242
00:33:53,428 --> 00:33:57,182
"a statement of the Adjutant
General of Massachusetts

243
00:33:57,265 --> 00:34:00,602
"that you are the mother of five

244
00:34:03,605 --> 00:34:07,317
"sons who have died gloriously
on the field of battle.

245
00:34:09,986 --> 00:34:13,740
"I feel how weak and fruitless
must be any words of mine

246
00:34:14,532 --> 00:34:17,911
"that would attempt
to beguile you from the grief

247
00:34:18,328 --> 00:34:20,747
"of a loss so overwhelming.

248
00:34:22,582 --> 00:34:24,584
"But I cannot refrain
from tendering to you

249
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:27,837
"the consolation that may be found

250
00:34:27,921 --> 00:34:32,175
"in the thanks of the republic
they died to save.

251
00:34:36,346 --> 00:34:37,639
"I pray that Our Heavenly Father

252
00:34:37,722 --> 00:34:40,809
"may assuage the anguish
of your bereavement

253
00:34:40,892 --> 00:34:45,272
"and leave you only the cherished
memory of the loved lost,

254
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:48,024
"and the solemn pride
that must be yours

255
00:34:48,108 --> 00:34:52,404
"to have laid so costly a sacrifice
upon the altar of freedom.

256
00:34:52,988 --> 00:34:56,157
"Yours very sincerely and respectfully,

257
00:34:56,241 --> 00:34:58,076
"Abraham Lincoln."

258
00:35:16,928 --> 00:35:18,763
That boy is alive.

259
00:35:19,472 --> 00:35:22,392
We are gonna send somebody
to find him,

260
00:35:23,518 --> 00:35:26,688
and we are gonna get him
the hell out of there.

261
00:35:27,731 --> 00:35:29,482
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

262
00:35:42,078 --> 00:35:44,539
We expected 32 tanks to float to
the beach. Twenty-seven didn't make it.

263
00:35:44,623 --> 00:35:46,666
- Miller, Charlie Company.
- Go on in, Captain.

264
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,876
I understand your situation.

265
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:51,046
But if we don't offload
those duel-drive Shermans by 0600,

266
00:35:51,129 --> 00:35:52,339
we're gonna have an entire division

267
00:35:52,422 --> 00:35:56,134
stuck at Carentan
with its pants around its ankles.

268
00:35:56,217 --> 00:35:58,637
Well, you let me know then.

269
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,598
Have Charlie Company hold at Vierville
until we can get some armour up there.

270
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:03,516
Yes, sir. Runner!

271
00:36:09,981 --> 00:36:12,734
Airborne was supposed to win
an open door for the rest of us.

272
00:36:12,817 --> 00:36:15,403
Instead they misdropped,
scattered all their sticks into the wind.

273
00:36:15,487 --> 00:36:19,658
- What's your situation?
- Yes, sir. Sector four is secure.

274
00:36:20,033 --> 00:36:21,284
We...

275
00:36:21,868 --> 00:36:26,957
We took out towed 88s
here, here and here.

276
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,708
They'd already gotten four
of our Shermans

277
00:36:28,792 --> 00:36:30,085
and a number
of our deuce and a halves.

278
00:36:30,168 --> 00:36:33,129
These two minefields
are actually one big one.

279
00:36:33,213 --> 00:36:34,881
We tried to make our way up
through the middle of it,

280
00:36:34,965 --> 00:36:37,342
but it turned into a mixed,
high-density field,

281
00:36:37,425 --> 00:36:38,551
little bit of everything.

282
00:36:38,635 --> 00:36:42,472
Spreng Mine 44s. Schuh Mine 42s,
pot mines. A-200s,

283
00:36:42,555 --> 00:36:46,059
the little wooden bastards
that the mine detectors don't pick up.

284
00:36:46,142 --> 00:36:50,605
This road here, they placed
big mushrooms, Teller Mine 43s,

285
00:36:50,689 --> 00:36:51,856
I guess for our tanks,

286
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:55,443
from here right up
to the edge of the village. Right here.

287
00:36:55,527 --> 00:36:57,487
So we marked them,
called the engineers.

288
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,863
Resistance?

289
00:36:58,947 --> 00:37:01,157
We had higher
support expectations, sir.

290
00:37:01,241 --> 00:37:03,535
There was an under-strength
company without artillery.

291
00:37:03,618 --> 00:37:06,871
Wehrmacht 346 Infantry,
Von Luck Kampfgruppe.

292
00:37:06,955 --> 00:37:08,999
We ended up with 23 prisoners.

293
00:37:09,082 --> 00:37:12,252
We turned them over
to MPs from the 29th.

294
00:37:15,005 --> 00:37:17,299
What about our casualties?

295
00:37:17,924 --> 00:37:20,051
Well, the figures

296
00:37:21,428 --> 00:37:24,931
were 35 dead, times two wounded.

297
00:37:25,015 --> 00:37:28,268
They just didn't wanna
give up those 88s.

298
00:37:30,186 --> 00:37:32,939
It was a tough assignment.
That's why you got it.

299
00:37:33,023 --> 00:37:34,524
Yes, sir.

300
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:37,277
John...

301
00:37:40,238 --> 00:37:42,157
I've got another one for you.

302
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,201
- Yes, sir.
- This one's straight from the top.

303
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:53,960
You and I are taking a squad
over to Neuville

304
00:37:54,044 --> 00:37:55,962
on a public-relations mission.

305
00:37:56,046 --> 00:37:57,881
You leading a squad?

306
00:37:57,964 --> 00:38:01,092
Some private in the 101st
lost three brothers,

307
00:38:01,176 --> 00:38:02,844
and he's got a ticket home.

308
00:38:02,928 --> 00:38:04,054
How come Neuville?

309
00:38:04,137 --> 00:38:08,058
They think he's up there somewhere,
part of all those airborne misdrops.

310
00:38:08,141 --> 00:38:10,852
It's not gonna be easy
finding one particular soldier

311
00:38:10,936 --> 00:38:12,103
in the middle of this
whole goddamn war.

312
00:38:12,187 --> 00:38:14,648
Like finding a needle
in a stack of needles.

313
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:16,316
But what about the company?

314
00:38:16,399 --> 00:38:19,694
We take the pick of the litter
and the rest get folded into Baker.

315
00:38:19,778 --> 00:38:21,488
Jesus Christ.

316
00:38:21,571 --> 00:38:23,615
They took away your company?

317
00:38:23,698 --> 00:38:28,244
It wasn't my company. It was
the Army's. So they told me, anyway.

318
00:38:28,328 --> 00:38:32,290
Give me Reiben on BAR, Jackson,
Wade, Beasley and Caparzo.

319
00:38:32,374 --> 00:38:33,792
Beasley's dead.

320
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:36,670
All right, Mellish, then.
We got anybody speaks French?

321
00:38:36,753 --> 00:38:40,590
- Not that I know of.
- What about Talbot?

322
00:38:40,674 --> 00:38:43,677
- This morning.
- Oh. All right.

323
00:38:44,135 --> 00:38:46,221
I'm gonna go try to dig up
another interpreter.

324
00:38:46,304 --> 00:38:48,056
Assemble at battalion motor pool
on the beach.

325
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:49,224
Yes, sir.

326
00:38:49,307 --> 00:38:50,684
- Sarge, what we gonna do?
- Okay, listen up...

327
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:52,143
- What?
- What are we gonna do?

328
00:38:52,227 --> 00:38:53,937
You're going home wrapped
in an American flag

329
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,064
with a hunk of cheese
in your ass, Caparzo, you smart ass.

330
00:38:56,147 --> 00:38:57,899
- Now, listen up.
- I thought you liked it in the ass.

331
00:38:57,983 --> 00:38:59,317
- What?
- I thought you liked it in the ass.

332
00:38:59,985 --> 00:39:02,112
Attention!

333
00:39:02,195 --> 00:39:03,446
As you were.

334
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:05,615
I'm looking
for Corporal Upham, Timothy E.

335
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:07,033
Yes, sir. I'm Upham, sir.

336
00:39:07,117 --> 00:39:08,743
I understand you speak
French and German.

337
00:39:08,827 --> 00:39:10,620
- Yes, sir.
- How's your accent?

338
00:39:10,704 --> 00:39:12,372
Just a slight one in French,
but my German's clean.

339
00:39:12,455 --> 00:39:14,124
- Has a touch of Bavarian, sir.
- Very good.

340
00:39:14,207 --> 00:39:15,792
You've been reassigned to me.
Grab your gear.

341
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:18,253
- We're going to a place called Neuville.
- Yes, sir.

342
00:39:18,336 --> 00:39:20,505
- When was this updated?
- Updated as of 0830 hour this morning.

343
00:39:20,589 --> 00:39:22,841
- Sir...
- This is the 12th SS Panzer.

344
00:39:22,924 --> 00:39:24,759
These are the two axes
that advance south.

345
00:39:24,843 --> 00:39:27,304
- Sir, there are Germans in Neuville.
- There are artillery up here, sir.

346
00:39:27,387 --> 00:39:30,098
- That's what I understand. Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

347
00:39:30,181 --> 00:39:32,350
Sir, there are a lot
of Germans in Neuville.

348
00:39:32,434 --> 00:39:33,518
You have a problem with that, Corporal?

349
00:39:33,602 --> 00:39:36,062
No, sir. Just if you consider
I've never been in combat, sir.

350
00:39:36,146 --> 00:39:37,772
I make maps and I translate.
And that's...

351
00:39:37,856 --> 00:39:40,775
I need someone who speaks
French and German.

352
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:42,611
- Yes, sir.
- My two guys were killed.

353
00:39:42,694 --> 00:39:45,363
Yes, sir. It's just that I haven't
held a weapon since basic training, sir.

354
00:39:45,447 --> 00:39:48,074
Did you fire the weapon
in basic training?

355
00:39:48,158 --> 00:39:49,367
Yes, sir.

356
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:52,203
- Well, then, get your gear.
- Yes, sir.

357
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:55,582
Sir, may I bring...

358
00:39:59,377 --> 00:40:01,880
May I bring my typewriter, sir?

359
00:40:06,927 --> 00:40:08,303
Yes, sir.

360
00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:13,350
Thank you very much, sir.

361
00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:15,810
- That a souvenir?
- No, sir.

362
00:40:15,894 --> 00:40:18,063
Take your time, Corporal.

363
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,945
You should look
on the bright side of things, Corporal.

364
00:40:25,028 --> 00:40:26,154
Yes, sir.

365
00:40:26,237 --> 00:40:29,282
For one thing,
you don't need to carry those.

366
00:40:29,366 --> 00:40:32,327
- You'll need that.
- I'll need that, sir. Yes, sir.

367
00:41:30,927 --> 00:41:32,304
Hey.

368
00:41:32,387 --> 00:41:34,556
You want your head blown off,
you fancy little fuck?

369
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:36,933
Don't you ever fucking touch me
with those little rat claws again.

370
00:41:37,017 --> 00:41:39,519
Get the fuck back in formation.

371
00:41:40,937 --> 00:41:44,441
I was just wondering
where you're from, that's...

372
00:41:49,487 --> 00:41:51,906
- Caparzo, is it?
- Hey, drop dead, Corporal.

373
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:53,116
Got you.

374
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:55,410
And another thing.
Every time you salute the captain,

375
00:41:55,493 --> 00:41:57,704
you make him a target for the Germans.

376
00:41:57,787 --> 00:41:59,581
So do us a favour. Don't do it.

377
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:02,626
Especially when I'm standing
next to him, <i>capisci?</i>

378
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,754
Corporal, what's your book about?

379
00:42:05,837 --> 00:42:07,547
- Hey. Watch your rifle.
- Sorry.

380
00:42:07,631 --> 00:42:08,882
Actually, it's about the...

381
00:42:08,965 --> 00:42:10,425
It's supposed to be about
the bonds of brotherhood

382
00:42:10,508 --> 00:42:12,427
that develop between
soldiers during war.

383
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,596
Brotherhood?

384
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:16,264
What do you know about brotherhood?

385
00:42:16,348 --> 00:42:18,475
Get a load of this guy, Fish.

386
00:42:18,558 --> 00:42:21,561
Why don't you ask
the captain where he's from?

387
00:42:21,645 --> 00:42:26,024
Yeah, ask the captain. He'll tell you
everything you wanna know about him.

388
00:42:26,191 --> 00:42:28,276
You wanna explain
the math of this to me?

389
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,654
I mean, where's the sense
of risking the lives of the eight of us

390
00:42:30,737 --> 00:42:32,322
to save one guy.

391
00:42:32,405 --> 00:42:35,575
- Twenty degrees.
- Anybody wanna answer that?

392
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:39,204
Reiben, think about
the poor bastard's mother.

393
00:42:39,287 --> 00:42:41,081
Hey, doc. I got a mother, all right?

394
00:42:41,164 --> 00:42:43,708
I mean, you got a mother.
Sarge has got a mother.

395
00:42:43,792 --> 00:42:47,462
I mean, shit, I bet even
the captain's got a mother.

396
00:42:47,545 --> 00:42:50,382
Well, maybe not the captain,
but the rest of us got mothers.

397
00:42:50,465 --> 00:42:54,094
"Theirs not to reason why
Theirs but to do and die"

398
00:42:55,512 --> 00:42:57,305
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean, Corporal, huh?

399
00:42:57,389 --> 00:42:59,057
We're all supposed to die. Is that it?

400
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,893
Upham's talking about
our duty as soldiers.

401
00:43:01,977 --> 00:43:04,479
- Yes, sir.
- We all have orders we have to follow.

402
00:43:04,562 --> 00:43:07,274
And that supersedes everything,
including your mothers.

403
00:43:07,357 --> 00:43:08,942
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

404
00:43:09,025 --> 00:43:11,444
Even if you think
the mission's FUBAR, sir?

405
00:43:11,528 --> 00:43:14,531
Especially if you think
the mission's FUBAR.

406
00:43:14,614 --> 00:43:18,285
- What's FUBAR?
- Oh, it's German. Yeah.

407
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:20,996
Never heard of that.

408
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:24,374
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.

409
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:28,086
Well, by all means,
share it with the squad.

410
00:43:28,169 --> 00:43:30,380
Well, from my way of thinking, sir,

411
00:43:30,463 --> 00:43:32,841
this entire mission
is a serious misallocation

412
00:43:32,924 --> 00:43:35,343
of valuable military resources.

413
00:43:35,427 --> 00:43:37,345
Yeah. Go on.

414
00:43:37,429 --> 00:43:39,889
Well, it seems to me, sir,
that God gave me a special gift,

415
00:43:39,973 --> 00:43:43,268
made me a fine instrument of warfare.

416
00:43:43,351 --> 00:43:46,062
Reiben, pay attention.
Now, this is the way to gripe!

417
00:43:46,146 --> 00:43:47,439
Continue, Jackson.

418
00:43:47,522 --> 00:43:49,399
Well, what I mean by that, sir,

419
00:43:49,482 --> 00:43:52,193
is if you was to put me
and this here sniper rifle anywhere,

420
00:43:52,277 --> 00:43:54,988
up to and including one mile
of Adolf Hitler

421
00:43:55,113 --> 00:43:56,823
with a clear line of sight, sir...

422
00:43:56,906 --> 00:43:59,784
Pack your bags, fellas.
War's over. Amen.

423
00:43:59,868 --> 00:44:02,162
Oh, that's brilliant, bumpkin.

424
00:44:02,245 --> 00:44:05,290
So, Captain, what about you?
I mean, you don't gripe at all?

425
00:44:05,373 --> 00:44:07,792
I don't gripe to you, Reiben.
I'm a captain.

426
00:44:07,876 --> 00:44:10,795
There's a chain of command.
Gripes go up, not down. Always up.

427
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,172
You gripe to me,

428
00:44:12,255 --> 00:44:15,800
I gripe to my superior officers,
so on, so on and so on.

429
00:44:15,884 --> 00:44:17,677
I don't gripe to you.
I don't gripe in front of you.

430
00:44:17,761 --> 00:44:19,763
You should know that as a Ranger.

431
00:44:19,846 --> 00:44:21,723
I'm sorry, sir, but...

432
00:44:21,806 --> 00:44:24,643
Let's say you weren't a captain,
or maybe I was a major.

433
00:44:24,726 --> 00:44:26,519
What would you say then?

434
00:44:26,603 --> 00:44:28,396
Well, in that case,

435
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,565
I'd say this is an excellent mission, sir,

436
00:44:30,649 --> 00:44:33,777
with an extremely
valuable objective, sir,

437
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,320
worthy of my best efforts, sir.

438
00:44:35,403 --> 00:44:40,909
Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow
for the mother of Private James Ryan,

439
00:44:40,992 --> 00:44:44,537
and am willing to lay down my life
and the lives of my men,

440
00:44:44,621 --> 00:44:48,083
especially you, Reiben,
to ease her suffering.

441
00:44:49,542 --> 00:44:51,586
- He's good.
- I love him.

442
00:45:02,264 --> 00:45:03,640
Right.

443
00:45:45,473 --> 00:45:48,685
- Thunder!
- Flash!

444
00:45:48,768 --> 00:45:52,022
Upham, over there. Reiben, you four go.

445
00:46:01,489 --> 00:46:03,533
Go, go, go, go, go!

446
00:46:08,872 --> 00:46:11,833
- You guys are a sight for sore eyes.
- Sergeant Hill, our relief showed up.

447
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:13,710
How many are you?

448
00:46:13,793 --> 00:46:16,421
Just eight of us.
We're not your relief. Sorry.

449
00:46:16,504 --> 00:46:18,048
You're not the relief,
what do you mean, sir?

450
00:46:18,131 --> 00:46:19,716
We're here for a Private Ryan.

451
00:46:19,799 --> 00:46:22,344
Who? Ryan? What for?

452
00:46:22,427 --> 00:46:23,553
- Is he here?
- Well, I don't know.

453
00:46:23,637 --> 00:46:25,931
Maybe with a mixed unit
on the other side of town.

454
00:46:26,014 --> 00:46:28,099
It's hard to get to. The Germans
punched a hole in our centre

455
00:46:28,183 --> 00:46:30,060
a few hours ago,
they cut us right in two.

456
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:33,647
- What's his name again?
- Ryan. James Ryan.

457
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:35,106
He dropped in with 101st.

458
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:38,151
- Goldman, get me a runner up here.
- Runner!

459
00:46:38,234 --> 00:46:39,903
Come on.

460
00:46:43,865 --> 00:46:46,451
Jonesy, make a hole up there!

461
00:46:47,994 --> 00:46:51,122
We got stopped by some intense
rifle action from the eastward.

462
00:46:51,206 --> 00:46:54,918
The Germans have been
reinforcing two regiments all day.

463
00:46:55,001 --> 00:46:57,212
The streets have been quiet
for about 45 minutes.

464
00:46:57,295 --> 00:46:59,798
Most of the German fire now
is concentrated to the westward.

465
00:46:59,881 --> 00:47:01,091
Who's that on the loudspeaker?

466
00:47:01,174 --> 00:47:03,176
That? That's Dagwood Dusseldorf,

467
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:05,095
our friendly neighbourhood
morale officer.

468
00:47:05,178 --> 00:47:08,181
<i>The Statue of Liberty is kaput.</i>

469
00:47:08,265 --> 00:47:11,643
- "The Statue of Liberty is kaput."
- <i>... kaput.</i>

470
00:47:11,726 --> 00:47:13,520
That's disconcerting.

471
00:47:16,564 --> 00:47:18,149
Take the second left...

472
00:47:18,233 --> 00:47:21,528
Your father was circumcised
by my rabbi, you prick!

473
00:47:21,611 --> 00:47:24,698
Private Ryan, James,
probably misdropped with the 101.

474
00:47:24,781 --> 00:47:26,783
- Got that?
- Cover!

475
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:35,834
Go!

476
00:47:59,816 --> 00:48:02,027
- You sadistic fucking animals!
- Get down.

477
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:05,196
They know we're not in direct contact.
They're gonna single out the runners.

478
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,990
Yeah. Why do they
keep shooting him up like that?

479
00:48:07,073 --> 00:48:09,701
Long as his lungs have breath in them,
he still carries the message.

480
00:48:09,784 --> 00:48:11,494
- We'd do the same thing.
- No, we wouldn't!

481
00:48:11,578 --> 00:48:14,539
- Wade! Get them ready to travel.
- Yes, sir.

482
00:48:14,623 --> 00:48:16,499
- Boyd!
- Come on!

483
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:19,336
Try again. See if you can let
Captain Hamill know we're coming.

484
00:48:19,419 --> 00:48:22,005
What's the rest of Neuville look like?

485
00:48:22,088 --> 00:48:24,466
Next block's got two-storey buildings,
both sides of the street.

486
00:48:24,549 --> 00:48:25,926
- There's a lot of windows.
...copy? Over.

487
00:48:26,009 --> 00:48:28,386
And then there's a wide open square
with pretty good cover on the left.

488
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:30,722
- Show me.
- Sarge, hold right here.

489
00:48:30,805 --> 00:48:32,223
Yes, sir!

490
00:48:36,645 --> 00:48:39,272
All right. Let's stay out of this enfilade
and use the buildings.

491
00:48:39,356 --> 00:48:40,482
Try a left hook.

492
00:48:40,565 --> 00:48:42,317
Shoot and scoot,
two of yours, two of mine.

493
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,861
Hastings, Goldman, up front!

494
00:48:46,029 --> 00:48:48,823
- Reiben, Caparzo. Fundamentals.
- They're still jamming us.

495
00:48:48,907 --> 00:48:51,534
Short runs. High and low at the corners.

496
00:48:51,618 --> 00:48:54,079
It's gonna be tight.
Be prepared for close contact.

497
00:48:54,162 --> 00:48:55,997
- Go. Upham.
- Yes, sir.

498
00:48:56,081 --> 00:48:58,208
- You stay with Sergeant Horvath.
- Stay right here.

499
00:48:58,291 --> 00:49:01,920
I'll wear him like underwear, Captain!
Stay with me.

500
00:49:10,053 --> 00:49:11,513
All right, past the end
of the block to the left.

501
00:49:11,596 --> 00:49:12,722
Those are the gates to the square.

502
00:49:12,806 --> 00:49:14,099
Good.

503
00:49:22,107 --> 00:49:23,900
Reiben, where's the captain from?

504
00:49:23,984 --> 00:49:26,152
You figure that one out,
you got yourself a nice prize.

505
00:49:26,236 --> 00:49:27,862
300 bucks, last I heard.

506
00:49:27,946 --> 00:49:31,199
Company's got a pool.
5 bucks gets you in.

507
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,955
Easy.

508
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:42,419
It's around this corner.
Defilade right up to those gates.

509
00:49:43,587 --> 00:49:46,006
Somebody must know where he's from,
what he did for a living.

510
00:49:46,089 --> 00:49:47,924
I've been with him
since Kasserine Pass,

511
00:49:48,008 --> 00:49:49,175
but I don't have a clue.

512
00:49:49,259 --> 00:49:51,052
My ankles are killing me.

513
00:49:51,136 --> 00:49:54,097
I'll need a wheelchair
before this war is over.

514
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,641
Oh, that's it. Oh, my God.

515
00:49:56,725 --> 00:49:59,978
Got ankles like an old woman.
Like an old...

516
00:50:00,061 --> 00:50:01,771
Oh, God.

517
00:50:03,523 --> 00:50:06,693
Reiben, so, you don't even know
where he went to school?

518
00:50:06,776 --> 00:50:07,986
Captain didn't go to school.

519
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:11,239
They assembled him at OCS
out of spare body parts of dead Gls.

520
00:50:11,323 --> 00:50:12,699
You gotta pay attention to detail.

521
00:50:12,782 --> 00:50:14,701
I know exactly where he's from
and exactly what he did

522
00:50:14,784 --> 00:50:17,037
'cause I pay attention to detail.

523
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,582
Hey, Upham,
careful you don't step in the bullshit.

524
00:50:25,921 --> 00:50:28,298
- Do it.
- Thunder!

525
00:50:28,381 --> 00:50:31,509
Thunder, or we will fire on you!

526
00:50:40,894 --> 00:50:44,314
Upham, tell them to show themselves.

527
00:50:55,617 --> 00:50:58,662
Ask them if they know
where the Germans are.

528
00:51:02,791 --> 00:51:05,669
- What's he saying?
- Something about the children.

529
00:51:06,711 --> 00:51:09,214
- They want us to take the children.
- No, no, no. We can't take the kids.

530
00:51:09,297 --> 00:51:10,966
We can't take the kids. We can't!

531
00:51:11,049 --> 00:51:14,302
We can't take the kids! No!

532
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:18,348
They think they'll be safe with us.

533
00:51:18,431 --> 00:51:20,600
It's not gonna be
safe when they're with us!

534
00:51:20,684 --> 00:51:24,729
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Are you nuts? Listen to the captain!

535
00:51:24,813 --> 00:51:28,608
- Are you nuts? Listen to the captain!
- They think they'll be safe with us, sir.

536
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,195
Caparzo! Put that kid back!

537
00:51:32,654 --> 00:51:33,947
It's okay.

538
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:37,284
- Caparzo! Put that little girl back!
- It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

539
00:51:37,367 --> 00:51:40,412
Caparzo, give that kid back now!

540
00:51:40,495 --> 00:51:44,541
Upham, how do you say, "It's okay"?
I can't. She reminds me of my niece, sir.

541
00:51:44,624 --> 00:51:46,585
Caparzo, get the kid back up there!

542
00:51:46,668 --> 00:51:48,003
Captain, the decent thing to do

543
00:51:48,086 --> 00:51:50,297
is to at least take her down
the road to the next town.

544
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:53,633
We're not here to do the decent thing!
We're here to follow fucking orders!

545
00:51:53,717 --> 00:51:56,094
Sarge, take this goddamn kid!

546
00:51:56,845 --> 00:51:59,014
Cover! Cover!

547
00:52:08,315 --> 00:52:11,276
God damn it! Where'd that come from?

548
00:52:13,069 --> 00:52:16,489
He was on the ground
before we heard the shot.

549
00:52:21,286 --> 00:52:23,163
That's where I'd be.

550
00:52:25,081 --> 00:52:26,291
I didn't see it.

551
00:52:26,374 --> 00:52:29,210
Four hundred fifty yards, Captain.
Maybe a shade under.

552
00:52:29,294 --> 00:52:33,548
I wouldn't venture out there, fellas!
This sniper's got talent!

553
00:52:37,969 --> 00:52:41,473
Please don't cry. I'm gonna take you
back to your mama and papa.

554
00:52:41,556 --> 00:52:43,767
Please don't cry. Come on.

555
00:52:46,978 --> 00:52:48,438
Carpy.

556
00:52:59,491 --> 00:53:01,826
- Captain.
- Hold on, Caparzo.

557
00:53:03,286 --> 00:53:05,455
Help me up. I can walk. I can walk.

558
00:53:05,538 --> 00:53:07,666
Caparzo, stay still!

559
00:53:19,135 --> 00:53:21,429
Two clicks, left wind.

560
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,434
Fish!

561
00:53:34,401 --> 00:53:37,237
Captain, can you see him
from there? How is he?

562
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,281
Wade, you stay put.

563
00:53:39,364 --> 00:53:41,533
Where's he shot, Captain?

564
00:53:43,368 --> 00:53:45,954
- Captain, can you see him from there?
- You stay there!

565
00:53:46,037 --> 00:53:49,708
Damn it, stay down!
What's the matter with you?

566
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:53,545
Am I gonna take care of you
if you get hit? Huh?

567
00:53:53,628 --> 00:53:56,881
- Fish, come over here.
- Carpy, put your head down.

568
00:53:56,965 --> 00:54:00,135
Why can't you put your head down?

569
00:54:07,767 --> 00:54:10,645
O my God, I trust in thee.

570
00:54:10,729 --> 00:54:12,731
Let me not be ashamed.

571
00:54:13,607 --> 00:54:16,443
Let not my enemies triumph over me.

572
00:54:26,244 --> 00:54:27,912
Copy it.

573
00:54:27,996 --> 00:54:30,332
Copy it and send it for me.

574
00:54:30,415 --> 00:54:32,876
Carpy, you're gonna send it yourself.
Put it down!

575
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:36,254
- It's got blood!
- I see it. Carpy, I see it.

576
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,930
It's to my dad. It's got blood on it, Fish.

577
00:55:12,958 --> 00:55:15,502
We got him. Stay down.

578
00:55:24,219 --> 00:55:28,431
- How bad is it?
- Chest, maybe lung shot.

579
00:55:43,863 --> 00:55:46,408
Get that 30 up the street!

580
00:55:51,204 --> 00:55:52,455
Detail!

581
00:55:52,539 --> 00:55:54,624
- Clear up!
- Clear down!

582
00:56:10,265 --> 00:56:13,184
That's why we can't take children.

583
00:56:19,232 --> 00:56:22,819
Sergeant Horvath, do an ammo check.

584
00:56:22,902 --> 00:56:26,573
Upham, canteens. Fill them up.

585
00:56:27,157 --> 00:56:28,950
- Sergeant Hill.
- Yes, sir.

586
00:56:29,034 --> 00:56:33,413
Gather your men. We'll form up
at the northwest corner of the square.

587
00:56:33,496 --> 00:56:35,165
- Jackson!
- Sir.

588
00:56:35,248 --> 00:56:40,045
Mellish, check the tower,
hustle back here. Right now. Go!

589
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:53,516
Fuck Ryan.

590
00:57:04,027 --> 00:57:06,446
- Thunder!
- Flash!

591
00:57:06,529 --> 00:57:08,073
Come on in.

592
00:57:12,869 --> 00:57:15,121
Hey, guys, we're looking
for Captain Hamill.

593
00:57:15,205 --> 00:57:16,957
Somewhere down there
across the square.

594
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,333
Across the square.

595
00:57:18,416 --> 00:57:21,002
Go easy. Watch for snipers.

596
00:57:21,586 --> 00:57:23,338
Sit down.

597
00:57:39,896 --> 00:57:42,482
Jimmy T, go find Captain Hamill,
bring him in here.

598
00:57:42,565 --> 00:57:43,900
What? Up there?

599
00:57:43,984 --> 00:57:46,736
How the hell should I know?
Would you go look, please?

600
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:48,780
Thank you, you moron.

601
00:57:50,156 --> 00:57:51,741
All right.

602
00:57:51,825 --> 00:57:55,287
You guys just flake out here for a while.

603
00:57:57,247 --> 00:58:00,709
Let me get this goddamn
hitchhiker out of my boot.

604
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,554
Drop your weapons!
Drop your weapons!

605
00:58:12,637 --> 00:58:15,849
- Drop them now!
- Drop the fucking weapons!

606
00:58:18,685 --> 00:58:22,772
- I'll shoot you! I'll shoot you!
- Drop! Drop! Drop them!

607
00:58:25,275 --> 00:58:27,569
Now! Put them down!

608
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:44,127
Clear up!

609
00:58:49,382 --> 00:58:53,094
- Shit. Shit!
- Clear up!

610
00:58:54,554 --> 00:58:56,139
Clear down!

611
00:59:08,401 --> 00:59:12,155
- Enough to make you old.
- Let's hope so.

612
00:59:22,582 --> 00:59:24,209
Fred Hamill, Pathfinders, 101st.

613
00:59:24,292 --> 00:59:27,254
John Miller, 2nd Rangers. Thank you.

614
00:59:29,256 --> 00:59:30,966
We're here looking
for a Private James Ryan.

615
00:59:31,049 --> 00:59:34,052
He's part of your outfit.
Any chance at all you policed him up?

616
00:59:34,469 --> 00:59:37,347
- How was the road in?
- Scenic.

617
00:59:37,722 --> 00:59:41,768
- We lost most of our ammo.
- Not to mention one of our men.

618
00:59:41,851 --> 00:59:45,230
Lieutenant, redeploy that bazooka
to the right side of the road.

619
00:59:45,313 --> 00:59:48,066
- Yes, sir!
- And get Ryan up here.

620
00:59:50,402 --> 00:59:53,697
Ryan! Ryan, front and centre!

621
00:59:53,905 --> 00:59:55,198
Ryan!

622
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:00,954
Here comes our boy.

623
01:00:08,461 --> 01:00:11,172
Told you he was an asshole.

624
01:00:12,716 --> 01:00:15,427
- Sir, Private Ryan reporting as ordered.
- At ease.

625
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:19,180
Captain Miller, 2nd Rangers.
He wants a word with you.

626
01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:22,100
This way.

627
01:00:22,809 --> 01:00:25,562
All right. Take a knee.

628
01:00:35,238 --> 01:00:38,700
Private, I'm afraid
I have some bad news for you.

629
01:00:46,249 --> 01:00:49,961
Well, there isn't any real
easy way to say this, so...

630
01:00:52,213 --> 01:00:55,425
So I'll just say it.
Your brothers are dead.

631
01:00:56,927 --> 01:01:00,680
We have orders to come get you

632
01:01:01,681 --> 01:01:03,850
because you're going home.

633
01:01:17,906 --> 01:01:20,533
Oh, my God. My brothers are dead.

634
01:01:28,041 --> 01:01:31,670
I was supposed to take them fishing
when we got home.

635
01:01:45,392 --> 01:01:48,603
I'm so sorry, James.
I can't tell you how much.

636
01:01:49,688 --> 01:01:54,067
- How... How did they die?
- They were killed in action.

637
01:01:56,444 --> 01:01:59,322
That can't be. They're...

638
01:02:00,073 --> 01:02:04,536
That... That can't be.
My brothers are still in grammar school.

639
01:02:07,747 --> 01:02:10,667
- You're James Ryan?
- Yeah.

640
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:14,921
James Francis Ryan from lowa?

641
01:02:15,005 --> 01:02:17,549
James Frederick Ryan, Minnesota.

642
01:02:24,556 --> 01:02:26,808
What? Does that mean
my brothers are okay?

643
01:02:26,891 --> 01:02:28,768
Yeah, I'm sure they're fine.

644
01:02:28,852 --> 01:02:30,520
Are you sure they're okay, though?

645
01:02:30,604 --> 01:02:31,980
We're looking
for a different Private Ryan.

646
01:02:32,063 --> 01:02:34,107
This is just a big foul-up.

647
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:35,900
How do you know?
How can you be sure?

648
01:02:35,984 --> 01:02:40,280
How do you know the foul-up isn't
that his brothers are okay and that...

649
01:02:40,363 --> 01:02:42,532
Lieutenant, I'm sorry for the trouble.

650
01:02:42,616 --> 01:02:46,786
I just wrote them a letter right
before I left. I got to get home.

651
01:02:47,954 --> 01:02:49,956
I got to get home right now.

652
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,542
- I wanna go home.
- Easy, now.

653
01:02:53,376 --> 01:02:54,878
- So, where in the hell is our Ryan?
- I don't know.

654
01:02:54,961 --> 01:02:57,213
Are you in touch with your CO?

655
01:02:57,297 --> 01:02:59,174
- That figures.
- What unit's your Ryan in?

656
01:02:59,257 --> 01:03:01,384
Baker Company, 506th.

657
01:03:01,468 --> 01:03:03,053
The guy with the broken foot,
he's 506, right?

658
01:03:03,136 --> 01:03:04,679
Yeah. Charlie, I think.

659
01:03:04,763 --> 01:03:06,222
- You think?
- Yeah.

660
01:03:06,306 --> 01:03:09,309
Ryan? Don't know... Man!

661
01:03:10,101 --> 01:03:12,687
- Where was your drop zone?
- Just inside of Vierville.

662
01:03:12,771 --> 01:03:15,649
Vierville? How the hell did you
end up way up here?

663
01:03:15,732 --> 01:03:18,902
You got me, sir. C-47 took heavy fire.

664
01:03:18,985 --> 01:03:21,780
Pilot went crazy trying to get out
of there, turning every which way.

665
01:03:21,863 --> 01:03:25,867
Took more fire on the drop.
Got messy. I ended up here.

666
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:28,036
I haven't seen a single guy
from my stick, sir.

667
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:29,329
God knows where they are.

668
01:03:29,412 --> 01:03:31,206
Anybody from Baker Company
have, like, a big mouth?

669
01:03:31,289 --> 01:03:33,041
Talk about where the drop zone
might've been?

670
01:03:33,124 --> 01:03:36,670
No, sir, but I know Baker Company
had the same rally point as us.

671
01:03:36,753 --> 01:03:38,046
Show me.

672
01:03:39,214 --> 01:03:40,382
My men are beat.

673
01:03:40,465 --> 01:03:42,425
We're gonna hold up here
for about three hours.

674
01:03:42,509 --> 01:03:45,095
We'll pull out after dark.

675
01:03:45,178 --> 01:03:48,014
Got anything left in this town
like a three-star hotel?

676
01:03:48,098 --> 01:03:51,309
Something with clean sheets
and soft pillows and room service?

677
01:03:51,393 --> 01:03:54,896
- How about a nice, comfy church?
- We'll take that.

678
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:57,899
What have you heard?
How's it all falling together?

679
01:03:57,983 --> 01:03:59,401
Well, we got the beachhead secure.

680
01:03:59,484 --> 01:04:02,237
Problem is Monty's taking
his time moving on Caen.

681
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,739
We can't pull out till he's ready, so...

682
01:04:04,823 --> 01:04:07,325
- That guy's overrated.
- No argument here.

683
01:04:07,409 --> 01:04:10,161
You gotta take Caen,
so you can take Saint-Lô.

684
01:04:10,245 --> 01:04:12,122
You got to take Saint-Lô
to take Valognes.

685
01:04:12,205 --> 01:04:13,873
Valognes, you got Cherbourg.

686
01:04:13,957 --> 01:04:17,377
- Cherbourg, you got Paris.
- Paris, you get Berlin.

687
01:04:17,794 --> 01:04:20,171
And then that big boat home.

688
01:04:23,425 --> 01:04:25,051
We sure as hell
could use you around here,

689
01:04:25,135 --> 01:04:27,304
but I understand what you're doing.

690
01:04:27,387 --> 01:04:29,014
- You do?
- Yeah.

691
01:04:29,097 --> 01:04:31,683
I got a couple of brothers myself.

692
01:04:32,434 --> 01:04:35,020
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

693
01:04:35,103 --> 01:04:39,065
No, I mean it. Find him. Get him home.

694
01:04:47,741 --> 01:04:49,743
What's with your hand?

695
01:04:51,077 --> 01:04:52,913
I don't know.

696
01:04:54,456 --> 01:04:55,874
It started in Portsmouth

697
01:04:55,957 --> 01:04:57,626
when they brought us
down for embarkation.

698
01:04:57,709 --> 01:04:59,252
It comes and goes.

699
01:04:59,336 --> 01:05:02,297
Well, you may have to get
yourself a new line of work.

700
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:05,800
This one doesn't seem
to agree with you any more.

701
01:05:10,972 --> 01:05:12,307
What?

702
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:18,647
- What?
- Nothing.

703
01:05:19,356 --> 01:05:21,900
What was the name
of that kid at Anzio?

704
01:05:21,983 --> 01:05:24,527
The one that was always walking
around on his hands, you know?

705
01:05:24,611 --> 01:05:28,323
And he was singing that song
about the man on the flying trapeze.

706
01:05:28,406 --> 01:05:30,158
- Vecchio.
- Vecchio.

707
01:05:36,748 --> 01:05:38,124
Yeah, Vecchio.

708
01:05:38,208 --> 01:05:40,085
He was a goofy kid.

709
01:05:41,795 --> 01:05:44,881
Remember, he used to pee
a "V" on everybody's jacket

710
01:05:44,965 --> 01:05:47,884
for Vecchio, for victory.

711
01:05:52,973 --> 01:05:56,726
He was so short.
He was a midget, wasn't he?

712
01:05:56,810 --> 01:05:59,562
"How did you get to be a Ranger?"

713
01:06:00,772 --> 01:06:03,400
He got shot in the foot once, didn't he,
when he was walking on his hands?

714
01:06:03,483 --> 01:06:06,444
Yeah. He could walk
faster on his hands.

715
01:06:07,404 --> 01:06:10,490
He could run faster on his hands than...

716
01:06:13,159 --> 01:06:14,536
Vecchio.

717
01:06:15,537 --> 01:06:16,788
Yeah.

718
01:06:18,665 --> 01:06:20,041
Caparzo.

719
01:06:26,464 --> 01:06:31,386
You see, when you end up
killing one of your men,

720
01:06:32,304 --> 01:06:35,140
you tell yourself it happened

721
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:41,229
so you could save the lives
of two or three or 10 others.

722
01:06:42,814 --> 01:06:44,858
Maybe 100 others.

723
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:52,032
Do you know how many men
I've lost under my command?

724
01:06:52,115 --> 01:06:54,367
- How many?
- Ninety-four.

725
01:06:55,744 --> 01:07:01,499
But that means I've saved the lives
of 10 times that many, doesn't it?

726
01:07:02,459 --> 01:07:05,921
Maybe even 20, right?
Twenty times as many?

727
01:07:11,801 --> 01:07:14,137
And that's how simple it is.

728
01:07:15,221 --> 01:07:16,932
That's how you...

729
01:07:18,224 --> 01:07:20,936
That's how you rationalise
making the choice

730
01:07:21,019 --> 01:07:23,521
between the mission and the men.

731
01:07:24,064 --> 01:07:27,150
Except this time, the mission is a man.

732
01:07:30,278 --> 01:07:32,739
This Ryan better be worth it.

733
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:38,703
He'd better go home,
cure some disease,

734
01:07:38,787 --> 01:07:42,290
or invent a longer-lasting
light bulb or something.

735
01:07:43,041 --> 01:07:44,751
'Cause the truth is
I wouldn't trade 10 Ryans

736
01:07:44,834 --> 01:07:47,671
for one Vecchio or one Caparzo.

737
01:07:47,754 --> 01:07:49,047
Amen.

738
01:07:51,549 --> 01:07:53,677
Look. There it goes again.

739
01:07:54,636 --> 01:07:57,555
Sir, are you all right?

740
01:08:02,769 --> 01:08:05,981
Now, look, we're gonna
move out in two hours.

741
01:08:06,398 --> 01:08:08,441
Why don't you get some sleep?

742
01:08:08,525 --> 01:08:11,736
- I don't know how he does it.
- What's that?

743
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:14,447
Falls asleep like that.
I mean, look at him.

744
01:08:14,531 --> 01:08:17,617
The guy's lights out the minute
his head hits the pack.

745
01:08:17,701 --> 01:08:19,035
Clear conscience.

746
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:20,996
Yeah. What's that saying?

747
01:08:21,079 --> 01:08:24,124
"If God's on our side,
who the hell could be on theirs?"

748
01:08:24,207 --> 01:08:26,835
"If God be for us,
who could be against us?"

749
01:08:26,918 --> 01:08:29,087
Yeah, what did I say?

750
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:33,300
Well, actually, the trick to falling asleep
is trying to stay awake.

751
01:08:33,383 --> 01:08:35,260
How is that, Wade?

752
01:08:35,343 --> 01:08:40,348
Well, when my mother was an intern,
she used to work late through the night,

753
01:08:40,432 --> 01:08:42,642
sleep through the day.

754
01:08:42,726 --> 01:08:44,894
So the only time that we ever got
to talk about anything

755
01:08:44,978 --> 01:08:46,271
was when she'd get home.

756
01:08:46,354 --> 01:08:48,982
So what I used to do,
I used to lie in my bed

757
01:08:49,065 --> 01:08:50,483
and try to stay awake as long as I could,

758
01:08:50,567 --> 01:08:54,321
but it never worked
'cause the harder I tried,

759
01:08:54,404 --> 01:08:56,656
the faster I'd fall asleep.

760
01:08:57,991 --> 01:08:59,910
Yeah. Well, that wouldn't have
mattered none in my house.

761
01:08:59,993 --> 01:09:02,203
My ma, she would've come home,
shook me awake,

762
01:09:02,287 --> 01:09:04,122
chatted me up till dawn.

763
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:06,708
I swear, that woman
was never too tired to talk.

764
01:09:06,791 --> 01:09:10,795
Yeah. That's probably the only time
she could get a word in.

765
01:09:14,925 --> 01:09:18,386
Funny thing is,
sometimes she'd come home early,

766
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:20,805
and I'd pretend to be asleep.

767
01:09:21,139 --> 01:09:24,768
- Who? Your mum?
- Yeah.

768
01:09:27,646 --> 01:09:30,649
She'd stand in the doorway,
looking at me.

769
01:09:31,232 --> 01:09:33,652
And I'd just keep my eyes shut.

770
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:40,283
And I knew she just wanted
to find out about my day,

771
01:09:40,367 --> 01:09:42,786
that she came home early

772
01:09:44,329 --> 01:09:46,289
just to talk to me.

773
01:09:49,626 --> 01:09:53,838
And I still wouldn't move.
I'd still pretend to just be asleep.

774
01:10:00,845 --> 01:10:03,139
I don't know why I did that.

775
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:20,448
We only got a couple of hours.
Shut up and go to sleep.

776
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,918
Captain? Sir?

777
01:10:34,087 --> 01:10:35,505
Corporal?

778
01:10:40,594 --> 01:10:43,722
How you doing there? Are you all right?

779
01:10:43,805 --> 01:10:46,808
Yeah, I think this is all good for me, sir.

780
01:10:48,435 --> 01:10:49,894
Really.

781
01:10:50,687 --> 01:10:52,188
How is that?

782
01:10:55,984 --> 01:10:58,528
"War educates the senses,

783
01:10:58,612 --> 01:11:00,614
"calls into action the will,

784
01:11:00,697 --> 01:11:03,408
"perfects the physical constitution,

785
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:06,828
"brings men into such swift
and close collision

786
01:11:06,912 --> 01:11:10,290
"in critical moments
that man measures man."

787
01:11:10,373 --> 01:11:13,126
Yeah. Well, I guess
that's Emerson's way

788
01:11:13,668 --> 01:11:15,337
of finding the bright side.

789
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:19,090
- You know Emerson, sir?
- I know some.

790
01:11:23,553 --> 01:11:27,599
So, where are you from, Captain?
What'd you do before the war?

791
01:11:29,601 --> 01:11:31,937
What's the pool up to?

792
01:11:35,315 --> 01:11:38,151
You know, I think it's around 300, sir.

793
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:41,571
Well, when it gets up to 500,

794
01:11:41,655 --> 01:11:44,032
I'll give you the answers,
and we'll split the money.

795
01:11:44,115 --> 01:11:45,992
How about that?

796
01:11:46,076 --> 01:11:49,788
Well, if that's the way you feel, sir.
I feel it's my duty under your command

797
01:11:49,871 --> 01:11:54,084
to suggest that we wait
until it gets up to 1,000, sir.

798
01:11:55,794 --> 01:11:58,296
What if we don't live that long?

799
01:12:01,424 --> 01:12:04,386
- 500?
- 500 would be good, yeah.

800
01:12:04,469 --> 01:12:06,429
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

801
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:11,893
- Get some sleep, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

802
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,670
Who's got sulphur powder?

803
01:13:22,964 --> 01:13:27,010
Medic! My buddy's bleeding!
He needs a tourniquet!

804
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:28,845
- Wade.
- Yes, sir?

805
01:13:28,929 --> 01:13:31,139
- See what you can do.
- Yes, sir.

806
01:13:31,222 --> 01:13:34,434
Hold on, fellas. It won't be much longer.

807
01:13:34,517 --> 01:13:36,394
How we doing here?

808
01:13:37,103 --> 01:13:38,480
All right.

809
01:13:38,563 --> 01:13:40,941
Yeah, doing all right.
Don't worry about it.

810
01:13:41,024 --> 01:13:43,151
Doc's in town.

811
01:13:43,234 --> 01:13:44,444
It's all right. It's all right.

812
01:13:44,527 --> 01:13:45,904
Don't worry, fellas.

813
01:13:45,987 --> 01:13:48,615
The 29th Infantry's breaking through,
they'll be here soon.

814
01:13:48,698 --> 01:13:50,951
Plasma. Anybody got plasma?

815
01:13:51,034 --> 01:13:55,080
- Captain. Hey, Captain.
- Soldier, you want to fill me in?

816
01:13:55,163 --> 01:13:56,873
Yeah. Lieutenant DeWindt, sir.

817
01:13:56,957 --> 01:14:00,710
99th Troop Carrier Squadron,
carrying in 327th Glider Infantry.

818
01:14:00,794 --> 01:14:02,379
This one was mine, sir.

819
01:14:02,462 --> 01:14:03,838
- I was the pilot.
- Private?

820
01:14:03,922 --> 01:14:05,382
- Twenty-two men dead.
- Private, take care of...

821
01:14:05,465 --> 01:14:08,343
I ended up over there without a scratch.
It took my co-pilot's head right off.

822
01:14:08,426 --> 01:14:10,136
Well, where's the unit?
Who are these people?

823
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:13,306
Well, the guys we came in with, sir,
they headed off first night.

824
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:14,557
Haven't seen them since.

825
01:14:14,641 --> 01:14:18,561
Meantime, other guys keep showing up,
one, two, half-dozen at a time.

826
01:14:18,645 --> 01:14:21,606
Then some officer'll come along
and patch together a mixed unit,

827
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:24,067
- head off to make trouble, sir.
- Water. I need a canteen over here.

828
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:26,152
We're looking for a Private James Ryan.

829
01:14:26,236 --> 01:14:28,571
He's in Baker Company,
the 506 of the 101st.

830
01:14:28,655 --> 01:14:30,991
No, you got me, sir.
A lot of guys come in and out of here.

831
01:14:31,074 --> 01:14:32,492
- Upham.
- Yes, sir.

832
01:14:32,576 --> 01:14:34,411
Check out that squad.
See if Ryan's in it.

833
01:14:34,494 --> 01:14:36,162
Yes, sir.

834
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:38,957
Reiben.

835
01:14:39,457 --> 01:14:43,545
Smell that leg right there.
Find out if it's south of cheese.

836
01:14:49,342 --> 01:14:50,677
What?

837
01:14:56,099 --> 01:14:57,684
Keep moving.

838
01:14:57,767 --> 01:14:59,644
Keep moving!

839
01:15:00,186 --> 01:15:02,564
I'm <i>Juden,</i> you know?

840
01:15:04,858 --> 01:15:07,485
Yeah, I couldn't pry him out of there,
hard as I tried.

841
01:15:07,569 --> 01:15:09,779
- I'd need a winch.
- Yeah.

842
01:15:13,783 --> 01:15:15,076
Stars.

843
01:15:15,535 --> 01:15:20,081
Yep, Brigadier General Amend,
Deputy Commander, 101st.

844
01:15:20,874 --> 01:15:23,376
Some fucking genius had the great idea

845
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:25,086
of welding a couple of steel plates

846
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:28,298
onto our deck to keep
the general safe from ground fire.

847
01:15:28,381 --> 01:15:30,133
Unfortunately,
they forgot to tell me about it

848
01:15:30,216 --> 01:15:32,510
until we were just getting airborne.

849
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:36,264
Well, that's like trying
to fly a freight train. Okay.

850
01:15:36,348 --> 01:15:40,060
Gross overload.
Trim characteristics all shot to hell.

851
01:15:40,143 --> 01:15:43,188
I nearly broke both my arms
trying to keep her level.

852
01:15:43,271 --> 01:15:45,231
And when we released,

853
01:15:45,315 --> 01:15:47,692
you know, I cut as hard as I could,

854
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:51,237
tried to gain some altitude
and still keep her from stalling.

855
01:15:51,321 --> 01:15:55,492
We came down like a fucking meteor.
And this is how we ended up.

856
01:15:57,744 --> 01:16:00,997
And the others, they stopped easy
enough okay though, you know?

857
01:16:01,081 --> 01:16:05,001
We were just... We were just
too damn heavy, you know?

858
01:16:05,085 --> 01:16:06,878
The grass was wet.

859
01:16:07,462 --> 01:16:09,589
Downward slope and all.

860
01:16:10,382 --> 01:16:12,300
Twenty-two guys dead.

861
01:16:15,053 --> 01:16:18,556
- All that for a general?
- One man.

862
01:16:20,767 --> 01:16:24,020
- A lot of that going around.
- FUBAR.

863
01:16:24,729 --> 01:16:26,690
- FUBAR.
- FUBAR.

864
01:16:27,524 --> 01:16:28,984
FUBAR.

865
01:16:29,067 --> 01:16:31,194
You all got that right.

866
01:16:31,736 --> 01:16:33,655
Hey, I looked up "FUBAR"
in the German dictionary.

867
01:16:33,738 --> 01:16:34,781
There's no "FUBAR" in there.

868
01:16:34,864 --> 01:16:35,991
- Upham.
- Yes, sir?

869
01:16:36,074 --> 01:16:38,827
There's more paratroops out there.
Find out if one of them is Ryan.

870
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:40,161
Yes, sir.

871
01:16:40,245 --> 01:16:42,872
Oh, you might want
to check these out, sir.

872
01:16:42,956 --> 01:16:44,583
Dog tags.

873
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:47,544
More than I really want to count, sir.

874
01:16:48,753 --> 01:16:51,590
I've covered a lot of bodies, sir.

875
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:53,049
Jackson.

876
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:56,678
- Start going through those.
- Yes, sir.

877
01:16:57,929 --> 01:16:59,514
I'll help.

878
01:17:01,683 --> 01:17:04,352
What do you think, Jackson?
Do you think that little prick's in there?

879
01:17:04,436 --> 01:17:07,355
Well, if he is, I'm gonna find him.
I bet that son of a bitch is here.

880
01:17:07,439 --> 01:17:09,190
I got big money saying
this guy's still alive.

881
01:17:09,274 --> 01:17:11,693
10 bucks says I nail him first.

882
01:17:11,776 --> 01:17:14,154
- Let's see who we got in here.
- You mugs don't stand a chance.

883
01:17:14,237 --> 01:17:16,323
All right, you think this little
shit bird is in here or what?

884
01:17:16,406 --> 01:17:18,116
Just keep looking.

885
01:17:18,491 --> 01:17:20,702
All right. Gary lanico.

886
01:17:20,785 --> 01:17:22,829
Ben Rubino. Mike Cessacchio.

887
01:17:22,913 --> 01:17:24,497
I swear.
All the guineas are buying it, huh?

888
01:17:24,581 --> 01:17:26,583
Oh, come on, not the right name.

889
01:17:26,666 --> 01:17:29,544
Wee Willie Winkie,
that's a buddy of yours.

890
01:17:29,628 --> 01:17:32,005
We gotta find this prick.

891
01:17:36,217 --> 01:17:38,136
Where is this son of a bitch?

892
01:17:38,219 --> 01:17:40,847
Don't mix them up, Jackson, all right?
Keep them in your own fucking pile.

893
01:17:40,931 --> 01:17:43,058
How am I supposed to know
who we got?

894
01:17:43,141 --> 01:17:45,936
Why don't you just shut up,
Reiben? All right.

895
01:17:46,019 --> 01:17:49,522
- Everybody be friends.
- Cranky there, huh?

896
01:17:50,607 --> 01:17:53,485
- I think I got a winner.
- What you talking about?

897
01:17:53,568 --> 01:17:54,819
Ryan.

898
01:17:55,236 --> 01:17:57,781
- Ryan.
- Take a look at that, Mellish.

899
01:17:58,406 --> 01:17:59,658
You know what?
You're a genius. You really are.

900
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:01,534
R-l-E-N-N-E.

901
01:18:01,618 --> 01:18:03,411
That's Rienne and that's French.
All right.

902
01:18:03,495 --> 01:18:06,081
You know what that means?
It means nothing.

903
01:18:06,164 --> 01:18:07,707
- What beats three of a kind?
- I got shit here.

904
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:11,294
- I got all guys from New York.
- I got a full house.

905
01:18:11,836 --> 01:18:13,838
- Do you need a hand with that?
- I got a full house.

906
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:16,800
- I got you beat. I got the straight flush.
- Full house, he's got.

907
01:18:16,883 --> 01:18:20,178
You were looking at my tags.
You're cheating, you know?

908
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:22,222
- Ryan.
- Fucking unreal, this guy.

909
01:18:22,305 --> 01:18:24,891
Do you need a hand with that?
Can you read that shit?

910
01:18:24,975 --> 01:18:27,519
Jesus Christ. Look at this poor bastard.

911
01:18:27,602 --> 01:18:31,022
- I guess they're not bullet-proof, huh?
- Guess not. All right?

912
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:32,524
I don't like
what he's got between his ears.

913
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:35,485
Sort of like what you fellas got
between your legs.

914
01:18:35,568 --> 01:18:37,654
- We got to give him that.
- That's not bad.

915
01:18:37,737 --> 01:18:39,239
Not bad with you, Jackson.

916
01:18:39,322 --> 01:18:41,324
All right, I got three of a kind. All right.

917
01:18:41,408 --> 01:18:42,576
- Full house.
- What the hell are you doing?

918
01:18:42,659 --> 01:18:44,786
The whole goddamn
Airborne's watching.

919
01:18:44,869 --> 01:18:46,413
These aren't poker chips.

920
01:18:46,496 --> 01:18:50,333
- All right, all right, all right.
- Put them back in there!

921
01:19:13,773 --> 01:19:15,442
He's not here.

922
01:19:19,863 --> 01:19:22,282
Maybe we should bust up
into a couple of different groups, huh?

923
01:19:22,365 --> 01:19:23,617
And wander the woods
like Hansel and Gretel,

924
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:24,784
calling his name.

925
01:19:24,868 --> 01:19:28,038
He's bound to hear us sooner
or later. Ryan!

926
01:19:28,121 --> 01:19:31,291
That might be
a little hard to do, Captain.

927
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,253
Maybe the locals have seen him.
Hey, you know...

928
01:19:38,548 --> 01:19:41,092
Ryan! Anybody know Ryan,
101st Airborne?

929
01:19:41,176 --> 01:19:44,971
Ryan? You know a guy named Ryan?
Private James Ryan from lowa?

930
01:19:45,055 --> 01:19:47,098
Anybody know a Ryan?

931
01:19:47,557 --> 01:19:49,517
James Ryan!

932
01:19:49,601 --> 01:19:55,565
Hey, Joe, doesn't Mandelsohn pal
around with a Ryan from C Company?

933
01:19:55,649 --> 01:19:58,944
- Yeah. I think so.
- Bring him up here, would you?

934
01:20:08,245 --> 01:20:10,830
- Do you know Private Ryan?
- You're gonna have to speak up, sir.

935
01:20:10,914 --> 01:20:12,123
You're gonna have to speak up, sir.

936
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:13,875
- My hearing is not good!
- It comes and goes!

937
01:20:13,959 --> 01:20:15,168
- It comes and goes!
- A German grenade went off

938
01:20:15,252 --> 01:20:17,087
- next to his ear.
- A grenade went off right by my head!

939
01:20:17,170 --> 01:20:20,215
Got it, got it. Do you know Private Ryan?

940
01:20:20,298 --> 01:20:21,758
Who?

941
01:20:21,841 --> 01:20:24,302
Private Ryan! James Ryan!

942
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:28,598
- Jimmy Ryan?
- James! James Francis Ryan!

943
01:20:28,682 --> 01:20:32,519
- No, no, no. James Francis Ryan.
- All right. Get me a pencil.

944
01:20:32,602 --> 01:20:34,938
Something to write on.
Something to write on.

945
01:20:35,021 --> 01:20:37,524
Quick! Quick! Come on, a pencil!

946
01:20:39,276 --> 01:20:41,069
A small one, sir.

947
01:20:41,695 --> 01:20:42,821
Write this down.

948
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:44,864
James Francis Ryan, question mark.

949
01:20:44,948 --> 01:20:46,741
Iowa, question mark.

950
01:20:46,825 --> 01:20:49,327
Do you know him? Does he know him?

951
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:51,454
Read the message. Look.

952
01:20:53,290 --> 01:20:57,294
- Yeah. Of course I know him, sir.
- Does he know where he is?

953
01:21:01,172 --> 01:21:04,551
Yeah, yeah. We missed
our drop zone by about 20 miles,

954
01:21:04,634 --> 01:21:07,971
ended up way over
by Bumville or some damn place.

955
01:21:08,054 --> 01:21:11,182
Him, me and a couple of other guys
were coming here to the rally point,

956
01:21:11,266 --> 01:21:16,438
ran into a Colonel who was gathering
up men to go to Ramelle.

957
01:21:16,771 --> 01:21:17,856
Ramelle.

958
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:20,400
To baby-sit a bridge.
That's the last I've seen of him, sir.

959
01:21:20,483 --> 01:21:22,402
Great! Great! Thank you.

960
01:21:22,485 --> 01:21:24,779
Write thank... Read, and thank you.

961
01:21:24,863 --> 01:21:27,324
- You're welcome!
- Assemble on me.

962
01:21:29,534 --> 01:21:31,536
Thank you, Lieutenant.

963
01:21:34,122 --> 01:21:35,540
Ramelle.

964
01:21:37,083 --> 01:21:39,252
We're here. There.

965
01:21:39,669 --> 01:21:44,966
Ramelle is on the Merderet River,
right here, just to the southwest of us.

966
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:47,427
You know anything about this bridge
he was talking about, Captain?

967
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:51,389
Yep. The target has
always been Cherbourg.

968
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:55,644
We can't push on Paris
until we take a deep water port.

969
01:21:55,727 --> 01:21:57,520
And Rommel knows that,

970
01:21:57,604 --> 01:21:59,189
so he's gonna try to get his armour

971
01:21:59,272 --> 01:22:02,651
across the Merderet river
anywhere he can.

972
01:22:02,734 --> 01:22:04,736
That way, he can hit
our invasion forces in the flank

973
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:07,489
when we make
the big right turn to Cherbourg.

974
01:22:07,572 --> 01:22:09,282
That makes any village on that river

975
01:22:09,366 --> 01:22:12,661
with an intact bridge
solid gold real estate.

976
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:34,766
Let's go.

977
01:22:44,234 --> 01:22:45,610
Captain.

978
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:25,900
What the hell is that?

979
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:30,238
A radar site. It's gotta be out of action.

980
01:23:30,322 --> 01:23:35,118
Looks like we got something in that.
Sandbag bunker right under the station.

981
01:23:36,286 --> 01:23:39,164
- See it?
- Yeah. That's my guess, too.

982
01:23:40,582 --> 01:23:42,334
What is it?

983
01:23:43,001 --> 01:23:45,295
Machine gun. Probably MG42.

984
01:23:45,378 --> 01:23:47,672
Jesus. Is that what got those guys?

985
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:49,674
Maybe one of them's our boy.

986
01:23:49,799 --> 01:23:53,178
No, their patches are 82nd,
so your luck's not that good.

987
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:55,347
Yeah, well, I don't know how fast
the rest of you betties are,

988
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:57,933
but I'm thinking we detour
this way quick and quiet,

989
01:23:58,016 --> 01:24:01,061
the krauts will never
even know we were here.

990
01:24:01,144 --> 01:24:04,731
So, Captain, what I'm trying to say is
why don't we just go around the thing?

991
01:24:04,814 --> 01:24:08,235
I hear what you're saying,
but we can't go around it.

992
01:24:09,861 --> 01:24:11,738
I'm with Reiben on this one, sir.

993
01:24:11,821 --> 01:24:15,951
- I mean, we left them 88s.
- For the Air Force.

994
01:24:16,034 --> 01:24:20,121
The Air Force isn't gonna spend
ordnance on one machine gun.

995
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:22,040
Captain...

996
01:24:23,083 --> 01:24:24,918
We can still skip it
and accomplish our mission.

997
01:24:25,001 --> 01:24:28,004
I mean, this isn't our mission, right, sir?

998
01:24:28,088 --> 01:24:30,298
Oh. That's what
you want to do, Mellish?

999
01:24:30,382 --> 01:24:31,841
You just want to leave it here,
so they can ambush

1000
01:24:31,925 --> 01:24:33,218
the next company that comes along?

1001
01:24:33,301 --> 01:24:34,678
No, sir. That's not what I'm saying.

1002
01:24:34,761 --> 01:24:37,555
I'm simply saying
it seems like an unnecessary risk,

1003
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:39,099
given our objective, sir.

1004
01:24:39,182 --> 01:24:41,935
Our objective is to win the war.

1005
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:49,150
Sir, I just... I don't have
a good feeling about this one.

1006
01:24:51,653 --> 01:24:55,365
When was the last time
you felt good about anything?

1007
01:25:16,261 --> 01:25:19,431
All right, three runners
with suppressing fire.

1008
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:22,726
Mellish, you hook to the right.
I'll go up the middle.

1009
01:25:22,851 --> 01:25:24,561
Who's going left?

1010
01:25:30,984 --> 01:25:32,819
Who's going left?

1011
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:38,658
I'll do it.

1012
01:25:39,618 --> 01:25:42,203
- I'll go left.
- All right.

1013
01:25:42,287 --> 01:25:45,081
Upham, switch off with Jackson,
and you linger in the rear.

1014
01:25:45,165 --> 01:25:46,625
Yes, sir.

1015
01:25:47,334 --> 01:25:52,172
We advance and keep pressure on him
till he has to change out his barrels.

1016
01:25:53,006 --> 01:25:54,966
I think we should be able
to hit him from grenade range.

1017
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:59,346
- Maybe I should go up the middle, sir.
- The way you run? I don't think so.

1018
01:25:59,429 --> 01:26:03,183
- Maybe I should go left, sir.
- Maybe you should shut up.

1019
01:26:03,975 --> 01:26:06,353
Reiben, base of fire.

1020
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:17,656
Mags and clips where
you can reach them, and...

1021
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:20,700
And extra grenades
for the base runners.

1022
01:27:45,410 --> 01:27:47,329
Hill's clear! Four down and dead!

1023
01:27:47,412 --> 01:27:52,375
Upham, grab the gear. Get up here!
We need water and extra dressing now!

1024
01:27:52,459 --> 01:27:54,711
Get the morphine out
of the extra medical kit!

1025
01:27:54,794 --> 01:27:58,173
Get the morphine out
of the extra medical kit!

1026
01:28:06,973 --> 01:28:08,016
God.

1027
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:09,893
Son of a bitch!

1028
01:28:09,976 --> 01:28:11,269
All right. The sulphur.

1029
01:28:11,353 --> 01:28:12,979
- Put my legs up. Put my legs up.
- I got him.

1030
01:28:13,063 --> 01:28:14,689
- More sulphur, Mellish.
- I got him. I got him, Wade.

1031
01:28:14,773 --> 01:28:16,149
- You're gonna be all right.
- Listen to my voice.

1032
01:28:16,232 --> 01:28:17,525
You're gonna be all right, Doc.

1033
01:28:17,609 --> 01:28:19,152
How's it look? How's it look?

1034
01:28:19,236 --> 01:28:21,154
Wade, you're fine.
You're going on a hospital ship.

1035
01:28:21,238 --> 01:28:23,198
- More sulphur! More sulphur!
- Put my legs up.

1036
01:28:23,281 --> 01:28:25,492
- Put my legs up. Put my legs up.
- He's gonna be all right.

1037
01:28:25,575 --> 01:28:28,036
- I got 'em. I got 'em. I got 'em.
- You're gonna be okay, Wade.

1038
01:28:28,119 --> 01:28:29,454
I got 'em.

1039
01:28:29,537 --> 01:28:32,290
Upham, give me your canteen!

1040
01:28:32,374 --> 01:28:34,167
- Come on. Come on.
...we're gonna get you out of here.

1041
01:28:34,251 --> 01:28:35,377
Put some pressure on it.

1042
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:38,338
- You're gonna be okay.
- How's it look?

1043
01:28:38,421 --> 01:28:40,215
- I'm getting some morphine.
- How's it look?

1044
01:28:40,298 --> 01:28:42,759
- It's all right. You're gonna be okay.
- How's it look?

1045
01:28:42,842 --> 01:28:44,552
You're gonna be okay.

1046
01:28:44,636 --> 01:28:46,513
Here comes the morphine.
Here comes the morphine.

1047
01:28:46,596 --> 01:28:49,641
Am I shot in the spine?

1048
01:28:49,724 --> 01:28:52,310
- You're okay, Wade.
- Am I shot in the spine?

1049
01:28:52,394 --> 01:28:54,479
- Lift him up. Easy, easy, easy.
- All right. Flip him over.

1050
01:28:54,562 --> 01:28:55,772
- Easy, easy, easy.
- Put some pressure.

1051
01:28:55,855 --> 01:28:58,400
- Easy, easy.
- Lift him up. Lift him up.

1052
01:29:00,944 --> 01:29:03,989
It's okay, doc. It's all right.

1053
01:29:04,072 --> 01:29:06,616
Wade, you got an exit wound.

1054
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:08,451
It's in the small of your back.

1055
01:29:08,535 --> 01:29:10,870
How big's the hole in the...

1056
01:29:10,954 --> 01:29:12,914
- About the size of an acorn.
- It's fine.

1057
01:29:12,998 --> 01:29:15,041
You're fine. You're fine.

1058
01:29:16,668 --> 01:29:20,547
Put some pressure on it.
Put some pressure on it.

1059
01:29:20,630 --> 01:29:24,843
- Put some pressure on it.
- It's all right.

1060
01:29:24,926 --> 01:29:27,637
Put some more pressure on it!

1061
01:29:28,138 --> 01:29:30,557
Is there anything bleeding
worse than the others?

1062
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:32,434
Yeah, right here, right here.
Do you know what it is?

1063
01:29:32,517 --> 01:29:33,935
- No.
- Right here. Yeah. Right here.

1064
01:29:34,019 --> 01:29:35,645
I'm gonna put your hand on it.

1065
01:29:35,729 --> 01:29:37,522
- We got some pressure on there.
- Right there.

1066
01:29:37,606 --> 01:29:39,774
- That's good.
- Okay. That's the one.

1067
01:29:39,858 --> 01:29:41,651
Oh, my God, my liver!

1068
01:29:41,735 --> 01:29:44,654
- Oh, my God! It's my liver!
- Something wrong, Wade.

1069
01:29:44,738 --> 01:29:46,114
Tell us what to do.
Tell us how to fix you.

1070
01:29:46,197 --> 01:29:48,074
What do you need? What do you need?
What can we do, Wade?

1071
01:29:48,158 --> 01:29:50,410
Tell us what to do.

1072
01:29:50,493 --> 01:29:51,786
Oh, shit.

1073
01:29:51,870 --> 01:29:56,374
I could use... I could use
a little more morphine.

1074
01:29:57,083 --> 01:29:58,877
More morphine, sir?

1075
01:29:59,836 --> 01:30:02,297
Okay. Okay.

1076
01:30:05,967 --> 01:30:07,636
Give it to him.

1077
01:30:09,930 --> 01:30:11,556
Give it to him.

1078
01:30:15,894 --> 01:30:18,605
- I don't wanna die.
- Here you go. Wade, here you go.

1079
01:30:18,688 --> 01:30:22,150
- Here it comes.
- There you go. There you...

1080
01:30:25,445 --> 01:30:27,405
Give him another one.

1081
01:30:34,496 --> 01:30:35,914
Mama?

1082
01:30:38,291 --> 01:30:39,751
Mama?

1083
01:30:40,543 --> 01:30:43,505
I want to go home. I want to go home.

1084
01:30:45,131 --> 01:30:48,134
Mama. Mama.

1085
01:30:48,218 --> 01:30:51,096
Mama, Mama, Mama...

1086
01:31:33,888 --> 01:31:35,640
Reiben, hold him!

1087
01:31:56,369 --> 01:31:57,746
Not yet.

1088
01:32:00,290 --> 01:32:04,336
First, make him mark and cover
Wade's body for grave detail.

1089
01:32:04,836 --> 01:32:07,839
Same thing
for those paratroopers down there.

1090
01:32:08,256 --> 01:32:10,717
Strip that stuff off
and check him for intelligence.

1091
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:15,013
Ask this piece of shit
if he's the one who shot Wade. Ask him!

1092
01:32:15,096 --> 01:32:17,807
- It doesn't matter.
- It does matter!

1093
01:32:20,226 --> 01:32:22,812
Shut up with that filthy pig latin.

1094
01:32:24,898 --> 01:32:26,816
Jackson, you're hit.

1095
01:32:28,985 --> 01:32:30,237
Shit.

1096
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:34,157
- I guess it just skinned the arm, sir.
- Get it cleaned and dressed.

1097
01:32:34,241 --> 01:32:36,785
You and Sarge, watch the perimeter.

1098
01:32:39,829 --> 01:32:44,376
- Sir, he says, "Please don't shoot."
- I don't care what he says, Upham.

1099
01:32:45,126 --> 01:32:48,171
Sir? Sir, you're gonna let them kill him?

1100
01:32:49,172 --> 01:32:53,426
- This is not right, sir.
- You can help him with the bodies.

1101
01:32:55,762 --> 01:32:57,597
What is happening?

1102
01:34:48,083 --> 01:34:49,459
American.

1103
01:34:51,378 --> 01:34:53,129
I like American.

1104
01:35:00,679 --> 01:35:02,430
<i>Steamboat Willie.</i>

1105
01:35:03,265 --> 01:35:04,599
<i>Steamboat Willie.</i>

1106
01:35:04,683 --> 01:35:07,352
Yeah, <i>Steamboat Willie.</i> American.

1107
01:35:18,863 --> 01:35:21,241
- He's says he's not finished.
- Yeah. That's what you think.

1108
01:35:21,324 --> 01:35:23,076
Come on. Yeah.

1109
01:35:33,003 --> 01:35:36,381
Please... I like America.

1110
01:35:37,716 --> 01:35:39,926
Fancy schmancy! What a cinch!

1111
01:35:40,010 --> 01:35:43,680
Go fly a kite!
Cat got your tongue? Cool beans!

1112
01:35:47,392 --> 01:35:49,603
Betty Boop! What a dish!

1113
01:35:50,604 --> 01:35:53,356
Betty Grable. Nice gams.

1114
01:36:00,071 --> 01:36:05,285
<i>I say can you see</i>
<i>I say can you see</i>

1115
01:36:05,744 --> 01:36:07,871
<i>I say...</i>

1116
01:36:14,878 --> 01:36:16,463
Fuck Hitler.

1117
01:36:18,548 --> 01:36:20,175
Fuck Hitler.

1118
01:36:29,017 --> 01:36:31,603
Sir, he says he's sorry about Wade.

1119
01:36:31,686 --> 01:36:33,730
He says he's sorry about Wade, sir.

1120
01:36:33,813 --> 01:36:35,523
Captain.

1121
01:36:35,607 --> 01:36:37,484
Captain, this isn't right.

1122
01:36:37,567 --> 01:36:41,112
You know this. He's a prisoner.
He surrendered.

1123
01:36:41,821 --> 01:36:43,782
He surrendered, sir!

1124
01:36:54,459 --> 01:36:56,211
Tell him

1125
01:36:58,213 --> 01:37:01,549
to march 1,000 paces in that direction,

1126
01:37:01,633 --> 01:37:02,884
then he can take off the blindfold.

1127
01:37:02,968 --> 01:37:04,052
We'll be gone, and he turns himself in

1128
01:37:04,135 --> 01:37:05,929
to the first Allied patrol
he comes across.

1129
01:37:06,012 --> 01:37:07,055
- Thank you, sir.
- You gotta be kidding me.

1130
01:37:07,138 --> 01:37:09,975
- We're letting him go?
- He's a POW, Reiben.

1131
01:37:10,058 --> 01:37:14,396
Can't take him with us.
Our guys'll pick him up sooner or later.

1132
01:37:25,031 --> 01:37:27,284
Only if he doesn't get picked up
by his own Wehrmacht first,

1133
01:37:27,367 --> 01:37:30,078
then thrown back into circulation.

1134
01:37:32,205 --> 01:37:34,666
Captain, you just let the enemy go.

1135
01:37:34,749 --> 01:37:37,669
- This is such bullshit.
- Y'all got that right.

1136
01:37:37,752 --> 01:37:39,754
Bullshit? Right. This is bullshit?

1137
01:37:39,838 --> 01:37:41,923
- Shooting a prisoner, that'd be okay?
- Upham, shut your mouth.

1138
01:37:42,007 --> 01:37:43,091
It's against the goddamn rules!

1139
01:37:43,174 --> 01:37:47,262
Yeah. The goddamn rules
just walked off with your new friend.

1140
01:37:49,139 --> 01:37:53,435
But I guess that was
the decent thing to do, huh, Captain?

1141
01:38:00,191 --> 01:38:02,527
Get your gear. Let's go.

1142
01:38:04,988 --> 01:38:07,032
You heard him. Gear up.

1143
01:38:08,408 --> 01:38:10,243
The Captain just gave you an order.

1144
01:38:10,327 --> 01:38:14,164
Yeah. Like the one he gave
to take this machine gun.

1145
01:38:14,247 --> 01:38:17,375
- That was a real doozy, wasn't it, Sarge.
- Soldier, you are way out of line.

1146
01:38:17,459 --> 01:38:20,712
Yes, sir. That was one hell of a call,
coming to take this nest,

1147
01:38:20,795 --> 01:38:23,548
but what the hell? We only lost
one of our guys, going for it.

1148
01:38:23,632 --> 01:38:25,967
I swear, I hope Mama Ryan's
real fucking happy,

1149
01:38:26,051 --> 01:38:29,638
knowing that little Jimmy's life is a little
bit more important than two of our guys!

1150
01:38:29,721 --> 01:38:32,682
But then again, we haven't
found him yet, have we? Huh?

1151
01:38:34,726 --> 01:38:36,144
- Here you go.
- Get the hell off me!

1152
01:38:36,227 --> 01:38:37,979
Reiben, get up.

1153
01:38:39,731 --> 01:38:42,859
Gear up. Fall in.

1154
01:38:47,948 --> 01:38:50,158
I'm done with this mission.

1155
01:38:55,121 --> 01:38:56,748
Hey! Hey!

1156
01:38:58,708 --> 01:39:00,794
- Sir.
- Don't walk away from your Captain.

1157
01:39:00,877 --> 01:39:03,171
- Reiben, get back in line.
- No, sir.

1158
01:39:03,255 --> 01:39:04,631
I'll spend the rest
of my life in the stockade

1159
01:39:04,714 --> 01:39:06,049
if I have to, but I'm done with this.

1160
01:39:06,132 --> 01:39:08,426
- I'm not gonna ask you again, soldier.
- Captain!

1161
01:39:08,510 --> 01:39:09,844
All right, now. This is bullshit!

1162
01:39:09,928 --> 01:39:12,430
- Fall in!
- You're gonna shoot me over Ryan?

1163
01:39:12,514 --> 01:39:13,890
No. I'm gonna shoot you
'cause I don't like you.

1164
01:39:13,974 --> 01:39:16,935
- Sir, listen...
- Sir, if he wants to go, just let him go!

1165
01:39:17,018 --> 01:39:20,355
Are you letting this happen?
Captain! You see this?

1166
01:39:20,438 --> 01:39:23,525
- Captain? Sir? Sir, Ryan's dead.
- Bullshit!

1167
01:39:23,608 --> 01:39:26,069
- Sir, we have a situation you might...
- That is bullshit!

1168
01:39:26,152 --> 01:39:28,655
Captain, I have a sixth sense about
these things. I know it in my bones.

1169
01:39:28,738 --> 01:39:31,616
We don't kill that son-of-a-bitch kraut.
Now you're gonna shoot me?

1170
01:39:31,741 --> 01:39:34,202
- He's better than you.
- Then why don't you just do it, Sarge?

1171
01:39:34,286 --> 01:39:35,954
Do it, man. Put one in my leg
and give me that...

1172
01:39:36,037 --> 01:39:38,707
I'm gonna shoot you
in your big goddamn mouth!

1173
01:39:38,790 --> 01:39:40,250
Well, put your money
where your mouth is...

1174
01:39:40,333 --> 01:39:41,710
- You don't know when to shut up.
- Do it!

1175
01:39:41,793 --> 01:39:43,420
- You don't know how to shut up.
- Pull the trigger, already!

1176
01:39:43,503 --> 01:39:44,838
Captain, please!

1177
01:39:44,921 --> 01:39:48,174
- What's the pool on me up to?
- What?

1178
01:39:48,258 --> 01:39:50,969
- You are a coward son of a bitch!
- I'm waiting, Sarge.

1179
01:39:51,052 --> 01:39:54,723
Mike, what's the pool
on me up to right now?

1180
01:39:54,806 --> 01:39:56,600
What's it up to?

1181
01:39:57,225 --> 01:40:01,813
What is it, $300? Is that it? 300?
I'm a schoolteacher.

1182
01:40:06,401 --> 01:40:08,653
I teach English composition

1183
01:40:09,988 --> 01:40:12,157
in this little town called
Addley, Pennsylvania.

1184
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:14,034
The last 11 years,

1185
01:40:14,826 --> 01:40:17,871
I've been at
Thomas Alva Edison High School.

1186
01:40:19,748 --> 01:40:23,418
I was the coach of the baseball team
in the springtime.

1187
01:40:25,962 --> 01:40:27,631
I'll be doggone.

1188
01:40:28,340 --> 01:40:31,593
Back home, when I'd tell people
what I do for a living,

1189
01:40:31,676 --> 01:40:34,596
they'd think, "Well, that figures."

1190
01:40:36,473 --> 01:40:38,725
But over here, it's a...

1191
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:41,978
A big...

1192
01:40:43,230 --> 01:40:44,898
A big mystery.

1193
01:40:45,941 --> 01:40:48,652
So I guess I've changed some.

1194
01:40:51,363 --> 01:40:54,532
Sometimes I wonder
if I've changed so much

1195
01:40:54,616 --> 01:40:59,162
my wife is even going to recognise me
whenever it is I get back to her.

1196
01:41:00,705 --> 01:41:03,250
And how I'll ever be able to...

1197
01:41:05,794 --> 01:41:08,421
To tell her about days like today.

1198
01:41:11,675 --> 01:41:13,051
Ryan...

1199
01:41:14,135 --> 01:41:17,305
I don't know anything about Ryan.
I don't care.

1200
01:41:17,973 --> 01:41:21,643
The man means nothing to me,
it's just a name. But if...

1201
01:41:23,478 --> 01:41:25,981
You know, if going to Ramelle

1202
01:41:26,106 --> 01:41:27,649
and finding him, so he can go home,

1203
01:41:27,732 --> 01:41:29,359
if that earns me the right
to get back to my wife

1204
01:41:29,442 --> 01:41:33,738
well, then... Then that's my mission.

1205
01:41:35,782 --> 01:41:37,367
You want to leave?

1206
01:41:37,450 --> 01:41:40,495
You want to go off and fight the war?

1207
01:41:43,373 --> 01:41:44,833
All right.

1208
01:41:46,167 --> 01:41:48,712
All right, I won't stop you.

1209
01:41:48,795 --> 01:41:51,381
I'll even put in the paperwork.

1210
01:41:53,341 --> 01:41:57,721
I just know that every man I kill,
the farther away from home I feel.

1211
01:43:22,931 --> 01:43:24,516
<i>By memories</i>

1212
01:43:25,850 --> 01:43:27,894
<i>Of the days gone by</i>

1213
01:43:29,729 --> 01:43:31,523
<i>In my solitude</i>

1214
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:34,901
<i>You taunt me</i>

1215
01:43:34,985 --> 01:43:38,530
<i>With memories that never die</i>

1216
01:43:39,739 --> 01:43:42,200
<i>I sit in my chair</i>

1217
01:43:42,284 --> 01:43:44,494
<i>Filled with despair</i>

1218
01:43:44,578 --> 01:43:46,413
<i>There's no one</i>

1219
01:43:46,496 --> 01:43:48,915
<i>Could be so sad</i>

1220
01:43:49,791 --> 01:43:51,835
<i>With gloom everywhere</i>

1221
01:43:51,918 --> 01:43:54,546
<i>I sit and I stare...</i>

1222
01:44:08,435 --> 01:44:10,520
Halftrack! Cover!

1223
01:44:26,202 --> 01:44:29,748
Who's doing the shooting?
Who's doing the shooting?

1224
01:44:50,644 --> 01:44:53,021
Get ready to move on their left flank!
Take their left flank!

1225
01:44:53,104 --> 01:44:55,982
Hold on and make sure they're down!

1226
01:45:17,128 --> 01:45:19,756
101st! We're coming out!

1227
01:45:27,180 --> 01:45:30,141
That was a recon element, 2nd SS.

1228
01:45:31,476 --> 01:45:35,063
We've been expecting a probe.
That must have been it.

1229
01:45:36,940 --> 01:45:40,360
Captain Miller,
Charlie Company, 2nd Rangers.

1230
01:45:40,443 --> 01:45:42,529
Corporal Henderson,
Easy Company, 501st.

1231
01:45:42,612 --> 01:45:44,114
Ryan. First of the 506th.

1232
01:45:44,197 --> 01:45:46,575
PFC Toynbe, Third of the 506th.

1233
01:45:46,658 --> 01:45:48,618
James Francis Ryan?

1234
01:45:48,702 --> 01:45:51,204
Yes, sir. How'd you guess that?

1235
01:46:03,008 --> 01:46:05,969
Looks like you guys got hit pretty hard.

1236
01:46:06,052 --> 01:46:09,598
Yes, sir. Small unit action.

1237
01:46:12,017 --> 01:46:15,604
They came in,
and beat the hell out of us with 88s.

1238
01:46:21,818 --> 01:46:25,363
Tell you what, sir, if you're our relief,
I'm gonna file a complaint.

1239
01:46:25,447 --> 01:46:27,407
I wouldn't blame you.

1240
01:46:28,158 --> 01:46:29,910
Who's your CO?

1241
01:46:31,494 --> 01:46:34,289
It would have been
Captain Jennings, sir.

1242
01:46:34,372 --> 01:46:38,835
I'm afraid the best we can muster up
right now is a corporal.

1243
01:46:38,919 --> 01:46:41,463
So, what are you guys all about?

1244
01:46:42,047 --> 01:46:44,549
We're here for him. Ryan.

1245
01:46:45,884 --> 01:46:47,344
Me, sir?

1246
01:46:56,686 --> 01:46:59,064
James Francis Ryan of lowa?

1247
01:46:59,898 --> 01:47:03,360
Yes, sir.
Payton, lowa, that's correct, but...

1248
01:47:03,443 --> 01:47:05,445
What is this about?

1249
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:10,075
Your brothers were killed in combat.

1250
01:47:16,873 --> 01:47:18,500
Which ones?

1251
01:47:21,419 --> 01:47:22,921
All of them.

1252
01:47:32,806 --> 01:47:34,391
On the level?

1253
01:47:35,809 --> 01:47:37,769
Yeah. I'm afraid so.

1254
01:47:40,522 --> 01:47:42,482
You might want to take
some time with this.

1255
01:47:42,566 --> 01:47:45,610
If there's someplace
you want to go and...

1256
01:47:54,619 --> 01:47:57,539
- What's this all about?
- Ryan lost his brothers.

1257
01:47:57,622 --> 01:48:00,000
- Which one?
- All of them.

1258
01:48:04,963 --> 01:48:06,339
You...

1259
01:48:08,967 --> 01:48:12,262
You came all the way
out here to tell me that?

1260
01:48:13,972 --> 01:48:16,141
Well, you're going home.

1261
01:48:17,642 --> 01:48:20,228
Our orders are to bring you back.

1262
01:48:23,523 --> 01:48:25,150
Bring me back?

1263
01:48:27,527 --> 01:48:31,031
Corporal Henderson, I don't mean
to leave you even more shorthanded,

1264
01:48:31,114 --> 01:48:32,490
but orders are orders.

1265
01:48:32,574 --> 01:48:35,410
Any communication about when
you're going to be relieved up here?

1266
01:48:35,493 --> 01:48:36,745
Sir, there's no way to tell. I mean,

1267
01:48:36,828 --> 01:48:38,371
we have no idea
what's happening south of us.

1268
01:48:38,455 --> 01:48:39,831
I have my orders, too, sir.

1269
01:48:39,915 --> 01:48:41,791
They don't include me
abandoning my post.

1270
01:48:41,875 --> 01:48:44,794
I understand that,
but this changes things.

1271
01:48:44,878 --> 01:48:47,255
I don't see that it does, sir.

1272
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:51,885
The Chief of Staff
for the United States Army says it does.

1273
01:48:51,968 --> 01:48:54,846
Sir, our orders are to hold
this bridge at all cost.

1274
01:48:54,930 --> 01:48:57,432
Now, our planes in the 82nd
have taken out every bridge

1275
01:48:57,515 --> 01:48:59,517
across the Merderet
with the exception of two.

1276
01:48:59,601 --> 01:49:01,186
One at Valognes and this one here.

1277
01:49:01,269 --> 01:49:02,520
We let the Germans take them,

1278
01:49:02,604 --> 01:49:04,147
we're gonna lose our foothold
and have to displace.

1279
01:49:04,231 --> 01:49:07,734
Private, your outfit wants to stay,
that's one thing.

1280
01:49:07,817 --> 01:49:08,902
But your party's over here.

1281
01:49:08,985 --> 01:49:11,196
Sir, I can't leave
until at least reinforcements...

1282
01:49:11,279 --> 01:49:13,698
You got three minutes
to gather your gear.

1283
01:49:13,782 --> 01:49:15,867
Sir, what about them?
I mean, there's barely hardly enough...

1284
01:49:15,951 --> 01:49:17,452
Hey, asshole!

1285
01:49:18,161 --> 01:49:22,040
Two of our guys already died
trying to find you, all right?

1286
01:49:27,087 --> 01:49:29,798
- Sir?
- That's right.

1287
01:49:39,683 --> 01:49:44,187
- What were their names?
- Irwin Wade and Adrian Caparzo.

1288
01:49:46,147 --> 01:49:47,691
Wade and...

1289
01:49:49,192 --> 01:49:50,610
Caparzo.

1290
01:50:03,039 --> 01:50:05,417
It doesn't make any sense.

1291
01:50:07,544 --> 01:50:11,798
It doesn't make sense, sir.
Why? Why do I deserve to go?

1292
01:50:11,881 --> 01:50:16,052
Why not any of these guys?
They all fought just as hard as me!

1293
01:50:19,681 --> 01:50:22,767
Is that what they're
supposed to tell your mother

1294
01:50:22,851 --> 01:50:26,187
when they send her another
folded American flag?

1295
01:50:33,403 --> 01:50:35,822
Tell her that when you found me,

1296
01:50:35,906 --> 01:50:39,576
I was here and I was
with the only brothers that I have left,

1297
01:50:39,659 --> 01:50:42,913
and that there's no way
I was gonna desert them.

1298
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:46,249
I think she'll understand that.

1299
01:50:46,333 --> 01:50:49,294
There's no way I'm leaving this bridge.

1300
01:51:32,295 --> 01:51:34,339
What are your orders?

1301
01:51:36,174 --> 01:51:39,552
Sergeant, we have crossed
some strange boundary here.

1302
01:51:40,512 --> 01:51:43,139
The world has taken a turn
for the surreal.

1303
01:51:43,223 --> 01:51:46,059
Clearly, but the question still stands.

1304
01:51:46,726 --> 01:51:49,688
I don't know. What do you think?

1305
01:51:50,772 --> 01:51:53,567
You don't want to know what I think.

1306
01:51:55,443 --> 01:51:57,112
No, Mike, I do.

1307
01:51:58,822 --> 01:52:02,117
Well, part of me thinks the kid's right.

1308
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:04,744
What's he done to deserve this?

1309
01:52:04,828 --> 01:52:08,790
He wants to stay here, fine,
let's leave him and go home.

1310
01:52:10,041 --> 01:52:11,334
Yeah.

1311
01:52:11,876 --> 01:52:17,007
But another part of me thinks
what if, by some miracle, we stay

1312
01:52:17,090 --> 01:52:19,718
and actually make it out of here?

1313
01:52:20,635 --> 01:52:24,264
Someday we might look back on this
and decide that

1314
01:52:24,347 --> 01:52:27,767
saving Private Ryan
was the one decent thing

1315
01:52:27,851 --> 01:52:30,770
we were able to pull out of this whole

1316
01:52:30,854 --> 01:52:32,981
God-awful, shitty mess.

1317
01:52:34,649 --> 01:52:37,152
That's what I was thinking, sir.

1318
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:40,488
Like you said, Captain,

1319
01:52:42,282 --> 01:52:43,992
we do that,

1320
01:52:44,451 --> 01:52:47,245
we all earn the right to go home.

1321
01:52:50,123 --> 01:52:51,666
Oh, brother.

1322
01:52:55,128 --> 01:52:57,422
This is everything.

1323
01:52:58,173 --> 01:53:03,803
You got the 230-calibre machine guns,
17 grenades, 11 Hawkins mines.

1324
01:53:04,554 --> 01:53:07,891
You got the two bazookas,
but they only got eight rounds left,

1325
01:53:07,974 --> 01:53:10,185
and assorted small arms.

1326
01:53:10,268 --> 01:53:13,772
We had a 60 mortar
but an arty round took it out.

1327
01:53:13,855 --> 01:53:16,524
Might as well be spit wads
if they roll on us with tanks.

1328
01:53:16,608 --> 01:53:19,861
- Which they're sure to do.
- What are you thinking, sir?

1329
01:53:19,945 --> 01:53:24,574
Well, I'm thinking they're going to try
to whip around the flanks.

1330
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:31,414
Unless we can draw
them up this main road here

1331
01:53:31,498 --> 01:53:32,624
in between these buildings

1332
01:53:32,707 --> 01:53:36,670
where all the rubble makes
a bit of a bottleneck.

1333
01:53:36,753 --> 01:53:38,797
- Disable 'em?
- lf we can.

1334
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:40,465
Make that tank a 60-ton roadblock.

1335
01:53:40,548 --> 01:53:42,384
We do that, we got
a fighting chance at their flanks.

1336
01:53:42,467 --> 01:53:44,886
Yes, sir that's good. Split them up.
Don't let them mass anywhere.

1337
01:53:44,970 --> 01:53:47,931
Hit them hard as we can, one-on-one,
and fall back to the bridge.

1338
01:53:48,014 --> 01:53:50,225
Machine gun on the move down here,
and number two up high somewhere

1339
01:53:50,308 --> 01:53:52,352
to piss a little bad news down
on their heads.

1340
01:53:52,435 --> 01:53:54,646
That would be the idea.

1341
01:53:55,230 --> 01:53:56,690
Jackson.

1342
01:53:57,315 --> 01:53:59,609
If we can, I'd like to get you up
in that bell tower.

1343
01:53:59,693 --> 01:54:02,737
- Yes, sir.
- Give you a little company if you need it.

1344
01:54:02,821 --> 01:54:04,864
Yes, sir. Some company couldn't hurt.

1345
01:54:04,948 --> 01:54:08,994
I'd say a.30 with about
1,000 rounds would be okay.

1346
01:54:09,077 --> 01:54:11,121
Parker, job opportunity.

1347
01:54:11,204 --> 01:54:13,206
Yeah. Well, it's not the worst idea
ever, Captain.

1348
01:54:13,290 --> 01:54:14,874
It's just that everything depends
on getting the tank

1349
01:54:14,958 --> 01:54:17,043
down this main road for us
to knock out, right?

1350
01:54:17,168 --> 01:54:20,213
So how the hell do you
plan on doing that?

1351
01:54:20,672 --> 01:54:23,633
Reiben's right. As our esteemed
colleague from the Airborne pointed out,

1352
01:54:23,717 --> 01:54:26,011
what we got here are
a bunch of spit wads,

1353
01:54:26,094 --> 01:54:29,931
so how do we stop the tank
if we get it to commit?

1354
01:54:30,015 --> 01:54:32,434
Give it a rabbit to chase.

1355
01:54:32,517 --> 01:54:35,687
We could hit the tank in the tracks.

1356
01:54:35,770 --> 01:54:37,856
Yeah, but with what?

1357
01:54:39,566 --> 01:54:43,403
- Well, we could try a sticky bomb.
- Sticky bomb, sir?

1358
01:54:44,613 --> 01:54:48,450
- Sir, are you making that up?
- No. It's in the field manual.

1359
01:54:48,533 --> 01:54:50,410
You check it out if you want to.

1360
01:54:50,493 --> 01:54:52,579
We seem to be out of field manuals, sir.

1361
01:54:52,662 --> 01:54:54,581
Perhaps you can enlighten us?

1362
01:54:54,664 --> 01:54:56,124
All right, you have
some demolition, don't you?

1363
01:54:56,207 --> 01:54:58,168
Some TNT or some composition B?

1364
01:54:58,251 --> 01:54:59,961
Yeah, that, sir, is the one thing
we got plenty of.

1365
01:55:00,045 --> 01:55:02,714
I got that bridge wired with enough
composition B to blow it twice.

1366
01:55:02,797 --> 01:55:04,799
All right. You can spare some, then.

1367
01:55:04,883 --> 01:55:08,136
You take a standard-issue GI sock,

1368
01:55:08,219 --> 01:55:11,348
cram it with as much
comp B as it can hold,

1369
01:55:11,431 --> 01:55:13,892
rig up a simple fuse,

1370
01:55:13,975 --> 01:55:16,519
then you coat the whole thing
with axle grease.

1371
01:55:16,603 --> 01:55:21,107
That way, when you throw it,
it should stick. It's a bomb that sticks.

1372
01:55:21,191 --> 01:55:22,817
It's a sticky bomb.

1373
01:55:22,901 --> 01:55:25,320
You come up with a better way
to knock the tracks off a tank,

1374
01:55:25,403 --> 01:55:27,030
I'm all ears.

1375
01:55:27,113 --> 01:55:30,659
This is good.
Now we got to surrender our socks.

1376
01:55:45,131 --> 01:55:46,633
Haul away.

1377
01:56:00,647 --> 01:56:04,568
All right, select the field of fire.
Crossfire with the one in the bell tower.

1378
01:56:04,651 --> 01:56:07,946
All right, I can cover
12 to nine from here.

1379
01:56:11,199 --> 01:56:13,285
- Easy!
- I got her!

1380
01:56:47,652 --> 01:56:49,529
Here are the mines.

1381
01:57:00,457 --> 01:57:02,876
For being the best we can do,

1382
01:57:02,959 --> 01:57:06,963
that forward machine gun
is not in a terrible firing position.

1383
01:57:09,633 --> 01:57:12,135
And this position right here,

1384
01:57:14,179 --> 01:57:15,805
this is the Alamo.

1385
01:57:16,389 --> 01:57:20,060
They push us back this far,
last man alive blows the bridge.

1386
01:57:20,143 --> 01:57:22,187
We only got a 30-second delay
on that fuse,

1387
01:57:22,270 --> 01:57:24,314
so let everyone know that
if you are that last man

1388
01:57:24,397 --> 01:57:28,485
you better hurry your ass off,
or you're not going to be alive long.

1389
01:57:28,568 --> 01:57:31,988
Captain? Where am I during all this?

1390
01:57:32,906 --> 01:57:34,866
Never more than
two feet away from me,

1391
01:57:34,950 --> 01:57:37,160
and that's not negotiable.

1392
01:57:38,286 --> 01:57:40,705
I'll get some ammo. Come on.

1393
01:57:43,750 --> 01:57:45,043
- Hey, Upham.
- Yes.

1394
01:57:45,126 --> 01:57:47,003
- Listen to me, all right?
- Yeah.

1395
01:57:47,087 --> 01:57:48,630
- You're listening?
- Yes.

1396
01:57:48,713 --> 01:57:50,799
All right, we're gonna be displacing

1397
01:57:50,882 --> 01:57:52,509
and falling back like crazy
sons of bitches.

1398
01:57:52,592 --> 01:57:53,677
Right up there.

1399
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:57,222
So you got to be Johnny on the spot
with the ammo, or we're dead.

1400
01:57:57,305 --> 01:57:59,015
- Right.
- You understand that?

1401
01:57:59,099 --> 01:58:01,393
- Johnny on the spot.
- Yeah.

1402
01:58:01,476 --> 01:58:04,604
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yes.

1403
01:58:04,896 --> 01:58:06,189
You know, when we were
shipping out of England

1404
01:58:06,273 --> 01:58:08,233
the supply sergeant was handing
out cartons of cigarettes,

1405
01:58:08,316 --> 01:58:11,403
and I said "No, thank you,
I don't smoke."

1406
01:58:12,404 --> 01:58:14,030
"I don't smoke."

1407
01:58:15,865 --> 01:58:18,827
- Quite a situation, huh?
- Unbelievable.

1408
01:58:20,161 --> 01:58:25,709
Here. Fucked up beyond
all recognition, right?

1409
01:58:26,167 --> 01:58:28,044
You got that right.

1410
01:58:30,297 --> 01:58:31,673
FUBAR.

1411
01:58:34,009 --> 01:58:35,051
Ouch.

1412
01:58:35,343 --> 01:58:36,970
- Yeah, well...
- FUBAR.

1413
01:58:37,053 --> 01:58:39,556
It's going to be a real show, huh?

1414
01:58:39,639 --> 01:58:41,558
Yeah. Okay.

1415
01:58:47,772 --> 01:58:49,441
Take it easy.

1416
01:58:50,609 --> 01:58:52,068
FUBAR.

1417
01:59:30,023 --> 01:59:34,402
- Who's that singing, sir?
- Edith Piaf.

1418
01:59:36,780 --> 01:59:39,324
What's she so upset about?

1419
01:59:40,158 --> 01:59:41,743
Her lover left her,

1420
01:59:41,826 --> 01:59:45,288
but she still sees his face
everywhere she goes.

1421
01:59:46,414 --> 01:59:48,291
That would do it.

1422
02:00:17,612 --> 02:00:20,574
"Even life itself only represents you.

1423
02:00:23,702 --> 02:00:26,288
"Sometimes I dream
that I'm in your arms."

1424
02:00:26,371 --> 02:00:28,790
What was that part?
She sang that before.

1425
02:00:28,873 --> 02:00:31,251
- The chorus. It's the chorus.
- The chorus.

1426
02:00:32,002 --> 02:00:34,629
"And you speak softly in my ear

1427
02:00:36,506 --> 02:00:38,925
"and you say things

1428
02:00:39,009 --> 02:00:41,428
"that make my eyes close.

1429
02:00:43,847 --> 02:00:45,932
"And I find that marvellous."

1430
02:00:46,016 --> 02:00:48,643
- Again, Upham...
- Yes.

1431
02:00:49,352 --> 02:00:53,982
...to be honest with you,
I find myself curiously aroused by you.

1432
02:00:54,858 --> 02:00:58,361
- Marvellous.
- No, it's really a melancholy song.

1433
02:00:58,445 --> 02:01:02,157
At the beginning of the song, she says,
"And then one day, you left.

1434
02:01:02,240 --> 02:01:06,286
"You left me, and I've been
desperate ever since.

1435
02:01:06,369 --> 02:01:09,539
"I see you all over the sky,
I see you all over the Earth."

1436
02:01:09,623 --> 02:01:11,291
Jesus, Upham,
any more songs like this,

1437
02:01:11,374 --> 02:01:13,084
the krauts aren't going
to have to shoot me.

1438
02:01:13,168 --> 02:01:16,004
I'm just going to slit my own wrists.

1439
02:01:16,087 --> 02:01:18,757
You know,
you're a strange bird, Upham.

1440
02:01:18,882 --> 02:01:20,759
Sorry, it's Edith, you know.

1441
02:01:20,842 --> 02:01:22,844
You know what
that song reminds me of?

1442
02:01:22,928 --> 02:01:25,639
It reminds me of Mrs Rachel Troubowitz
and what she said to me

1443
02:01:25,722 --> 02:01:27,224
the day I left for basic.

1444
02:01:27,307 --> 02:01:29,851
What, "Don't touch me"?

1445
02:01:29,935 --> 02:01:32,520
No. Mrs Rachel Troubowitz
is our super's wife.

1446
02:01:32,604 --> 02:01:35,440
She comes into my mom's shop
to try on a few things, all right?

1447
02:01:35,523 --> 02:01:39,319
And she's easily, like, a 44 double E.

1448
02:01:39,402 --> 02:01:41,029
- Double E?
- These things are massive.

1449
02:01:41,112 --> 02:01:42,364
Those are big.

1450
02:01:42,447 --> 02:01:45,825
No. And I've got her convinced
that she's, like, a 42 D, all right?

1451
02:01:45,909 --> 02:01:47,619
So we're in the dressing room,
she's trying to squeeze

1452
02:01:47,702 --> 02:01:51,164
into this side-cut,
silk-ribboned, triple-panel girdle

1453
02:01:51,289 --> 02:01:53,500
with the shelf-lift brassiere.

1454
02:01:53,583 --> 02:01:56,169
And it's beautiful 'cause she's just
pouring out of this thing, you know?

1455
02:01:56,253 --> 02:01:58,004
- Is it really tight?
- No, no. It's beautiful.

1456
02:01:58,088 --> 02:01:59,547
And she sees me, and she can tell

1457
02:01:59,631 --> 02:02:02,259
I got a hard-on the size
of the Statue of Liberty, all right?

1458
02:02:02,342 --> 02:02:04,386
And she says to me,
"Richard, calm down."

1459
02:02:04,469 --> 02:02:06,972
And she says, "When you're over there,

1460
02:02:07,055 --> 02:02:08,932
"if you see anything that upsets you,

1461
02:02:09,015 --> 02:02:12,102
"or if you're ever scared,
I want you to close your eyes

1462
02:02:12,185 --> 02:02:15,230
"and think of these. You understand?"

1463
02:02:16,690 --> 02:02:18,817
So I said, "Yes, ma'am."

1464
02:02:31,997 --> 02:02:34,040
Are you all right, sir?

1465
02:02:35,083 --> 02:02:37,836
Yeah, I'm just keeping the rhythm.

1466
02:02:42,757 --> 02:02:45,677
Is it true you were
a teacher back home?

1467
02:02:46,761 --> 02:02:48,221
Yes.

1468
02:02:48,305 --> 02:02:50,640
See, that's something I could never do,
you know.

1469
02:02:50,724 --> 02:02:55,186
Not after the way me and my brothers
treated our teachers. No, sir.

1470
02:02:57,522 --> 02:02:59,983
I had 1,000 kids like you.

1471
02:03:06,197 --> 02:03:08,909
I can't see my brothers' faces.

1472
02:03:10,243 --> 02:03:12,954
I've been trying,
and I can't see their faces at all.

1473
02:03:13,038 --> 02:03:15,248
Has that ever happened to you?

1474
02:03:15,332 --> 02:03:17,709
You gotta think of a context.

1475
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:22,047
What does that mean?

1476
02:03:22,130 --> 02:03:23,673
Well, you don't just think
about their faces.

1477
02:03:23,757 --> 02:03:28,386
You think about something specific,
something you've done together.

1478
02:03:32,140 --> 02:03:35,101
Well, when I think of home,
I think of something specific.

1479
02:03:35,185 --> 02:03:38,271
I think of my hammock in the backyard,

1480
02:03:39,105 --> 02:03:43,443
or my wife pruning the rose bushes
in a pair of my old work gloves.

1481
02:03:47,739 --> 02:03:51,076
This one night, two of my brothers came

1482
02:03:51,159 --> 02:03:54,162
and woke me up in
the middle of the night,

1483
02:03:54,996 --> 02:03:58,041
and they said
they had a surprise for me.

1484
02:03:58,583 --> 02:04:01,753
So they took me to the barn,
up into the loft,

1485
02:04:01,836 --> 02:04:04,798
and there was my oldest brother Dan

1486
02:04:05,924 --> 02:04:09,010
with Alice. Alice Jardine.

1487
02:04:11,972 --> 02:04:16,184
I mean, picture a girl who just took
a nosedive from the ugly tree

1488
02:04:16,268 --> 02:04:18,895
and hit every branch coming down.

1489
02:04:20,814 --> 02:04:23,483
And Dan's got her shirt off.

1490
02:04:23,567 --> 02:04:26,361
So he's working on this bra
and he's trying to get it off

1491
02:04:26,444 --> 02:04:29,656
and all of a sudden,
Sean just screams out,

1492
02:04:30,490 --> 02:04:33,868
"Danny, you're a young man!
Don't do it!"

1493
02:04:36,496 --> 02:04:40,041
And so Alice Jardine hears this
and she screams, and she jumps up,

1494
02:04:40,125 --> 02:04:41,793
and she tries to get
running out of the barn,

1495
02:04:41,876 --> 02:04:43,086
but she's still got this shirt
over her head.

1496
02:04:43,169 --> 02:04:47,382
She goes running right into the wall
and knocks herself out.

1497
02:04:47,465 --> 02:04:51,678
So now Dan is just so mad at us,
he starts coming after us,

1498
02:04:51,761 --> 02:04:54,139
but at the same time,
Alice is over there unconscious.

1499
02:04:54,222 --> 02:04:55,724
He's got to wake her up.

1500
02:04:55,807 --> 02:04:59,102
So he grabs her by a leg
and he's dragging her.

1501
02:04:59,185 --> 02:05:02,397
At the same time, he picks up a shovel
and he's going after Sean.

1502
02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:04,649
And Sean said,
"What are you trying to hit me for?

1503
02:05:04,733 --> 02:05:06,818
"I just did you a favour."

1504
02:05:08,653 --> 02:05:10,572
And so this makes Dan more angry.

1505
02:05:10,655 --> 02:05:13,617
He tries to swing this thing.
He loses the shovel.

1506
02:05:13,700 --> 02:05:16,411
It goes out of his grasp
and hits a kerosene lantern.

1507
02:05:16,494 --> 02:05:19,122
The thing explodes,
the whole barn almost goes up

1508
02:05:19,205 --> 02:05:21,374
because of this thing.

1509
02:05:36,223 --> 02:05:38,141
That was it. That was the last...
That was...

1510
02:05:38,225 --> 02:05:39,809
Dan went off to basic next day.

1511
02:05:39,893 --> 02:05:43,521
That was the last night
the four of us were together.

1512
02:05:43,605 --> 02:05:45,690
That was two years ago.

1513
02:05:47,609 --> 02:05:48,985
Oh, my.

1514
02:05:50,946 --> 02:05:54,491
Tell me about your wife
and those rose bushes.

1515
02:05:55,700 --> 02:05:57,077
No.

1516
02:05:58,286 --> 02:06:00,997
No. That one I save just for me.

1517
02:07:06,271 --> 02:07:08,189
Enemy from the east.

1518
02:07:09,357 --> 02:07:12,277
He sees Tiger tanks, two of them.

1519
02:07:12,360 --> 02:07:14,362
Panzer tanks, two of them.

1520
02:07:14,446 --> 02:07:16,281
Infantry.

1521
02:07:16,364 --> 02:07:18,241
Fifty plus change.

1522
02:07:27,167 --> 02:07:28,960
Disperse! You know what to do!

1523
02:07:29,044 --> 02:07:30,587
- Reiben, get on the rabbit.
- Yes, sir.

1524
02:07:30,670 --> 02:07:34,049
- Upham, get some cover.
- Mellish and Henderson, lock and load!

1525
02:07:34,132 --> 02:07:37,093
- This is it.
- Everybody check your ammo!

1526
02:07:37,761 --> 02:07:39,054
Good luck, Reiben.

1527
02:07:39,137 --> 02:07:42,474
I don't need any luck, Sarge,
I was born lucky.

1528
02:07:55,237 --> 02:07:56,529
One in five tracer?

1529
02:07:56,613 --> 02:07:58,615
Yep, and tracers point both ways.

1530
02:07:58,698 --> 02:08:02,744
Yeah? Why don't you check
the head space and she should run.

1531
02:08:10,585 --> 02:08:12,796
Upham! Hustle up!

1532
02:09:03,138 --> 02:09:04,806
- Corporal Upham?
- Yes, sir.

1533
02:09:04,890 --> 02:09:07,183
We don't have a 30-calibre
machine gun in this position.

1534
02:09:07,267 --> 02:09:10,645
Either Mr Mellish or Mr Jackson
in the bell tower needs that.

1535
02:09:10,729 --> 02:09:12,105
Yes, sir.

1536
02:09:12,939 --> 02:09:16,192
Upham! Jackson's fine.
Turn around to Mellish.

1537
02:09:37,631 --> 02:09:42,594
There's a ton of infantry, Captain.
I don't know if they took the bait though.

1538
02:10:05,367 --> 02:10:07,494
You got any more of that?

1539
02:10:53,623 --> 02:10:55,959
Panzers didn't take the bait.

1540
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:03,717
Infantry's moving to the left.

1541
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:07,178
Halftrack just went by
with about 20 troops, sir.

1542
02:12:45,819 --> 02:12:49,155
Mellish! Henderson! Displace!

1543
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:12,596
Do it, now! Light it up!

1544
02:13:12,679 --> 02:13:14,431
You! Light it!

1545
02:13:25,609 --> 02:13:27,736
Thirty infantry on the right flank!

1546
02:13:27,819 --> 02:13:30,322
Get over there,
find a hole, and stop them!

1547
02:13:30,405 --> 02:13:32,073
Displace!

1548
02:13:43,668 --> 02:13:44,961
Upham!

1549
02:14:00,352 --> 02:14:01,811
Clear!

1550
02:14:03,605 --> 02:14:04,898
Krauts!

1551
02:14:06,900 --> 02:14:08,360
Right flank!

1552
02:14:44,813 --> 02:14:46,982
Get down! Get down!

1553
02:14:54,072 --> 02:14:57,200
Upham! Upham! 30-cal! Hurry!

1554
02:14:57,284 --> 02:15:00,787
And find the captain!
This flank's going to fold!

1555
02:15:55,675 --> 02:15:58,470
Reversing! He's still in this fight!

1556
02:15:59,471 --> 02:16:02,015
No, no, Ryan, get down! Get down!

1557
02:16:14,945 --> 02:16:16,238
Ryan!

1558
02:16:35,465 --> 02:16:36,841
Ryan!

1559
02:16:39,177 --> 02:16:40,804
- Ryan!
- Get off me!

1560
02:16:40,887 --> 02:16:43,390
- Are you all right?
- Get off me!

1561
02:16:43,473 --> 02:16:45,600
Yeah, yeah,
I'm fine, too, Captain. Thanks.

1562
02:16:46,601 --> 02:16:51,231
Okay, both sides!
Get aboard! Get a grenade in there!

1563
02:16:54,067 --> 02:16:55,569
Grenade!

1564
02:16:57,404 --> 02:16:59,072
20-mill!

1565
02:17:00,532 --> 02:17:03,243
Flak gun, 20 millimetre. Take it out!

1566
02:17:15,589 --> 02:17:19,134
Heavy weapon in defilade below!
I ain't got a shot!

1567
02:17:23,638 --> 02:17:25,390
Pincer move, Parker!

1568
02:17:25,473 --> 02:17:27,976
- Targets 8 o'clock low!
- Shit!

1569
02:17:28,059 --> 02:17:30,270
God grant me strength.

1570
02:17:44,200 --> 02:17:45,744
Displace!

1571
02:17:45,827 --> 02:17:47,245
Come on!

1572
02:18:03,053 --> 02:18:05,805
Cover, Upham! Cover! Cover!

1573
02:18:22,572 --> 02:18:24,532
I'm out of 30-calibre.

1574
02:18:27,369 --> 02:18:30,789
Blessed be the Lord, my strength,
which teaches my hands to war

1575
02:18:30,872 --> 02:18:33,250
and my fingers to fight.

1576
02:18:41,758 --> 02:18:44,261
My goodness and my fortress,

1577
02:18:44,344 --> 02:18:47,013
my high tower and my deliverer,

1578
02:18:49,599 --> 02:18:52,811
my shield and he in whom I trust.

1579
02:18:55,855 --> 02:18:57,941
Come here, baby.

1580
02:19:20,547 --> 02:19:22,340
Parker, get down!

1581
02:19:44,029 --> 02:19:46,448
Captain, that 20-millimetre's killing us.

1582
02:19:46,531 --> 02:19:48,825
We gotta try to flank it somehow.

1583
02:19:48,909 --> 02:19:51,786
Well, let me get over for the top shot.

1584
02:20:16,269 --> 02:20:17,729
Upham!

1585
02:20:36,581 --> 02:20:41,044
Upham! Upham!
Upham, ammo, God damn it!

1586
02:21:24,254 --> 02:21:26,673
I'm jammed! I'm jammed!
You got any 30-cal?

1587
02:21:26,756 --> 02:21:28,425
- I'm out.
- Shit.

1588
02:21:39,853 --> 02:21:42,355
Upham! Upham!

1589
02:22:40,872 --> 02:22:42,332
Reiben!

1590
02:23:08,817 --> 02:23:12,988
I'm out! I need another bandoleer!
Anybody got a bandoleer?

1591
02:23:37,971 --> 02:23:40,181
God! God!

1592
02:23:44,436 --> 02:23:47,397
You stupid son of a bitch!

1593
02:24:31,107 --> 02:24:33,652
Let's stop. Let's stop. Let's stop.
Listen to me! Listen to me! Stop!

1594
02:24:33,735 --> 02:24:35,487
Stop! Don't...

1595
02:25:12,524 --> 02:25:17,362
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

1596
02:25:17,445 --> 02:25:19,239
Son of a bitch!

1597
02:25:20,699 --> 02:25:21,741
Bitch!

1598
02:26:40,779 --> 02:26:43,907
- I'm out.
- Those 60 rounds.

1599
02:26:45,283 --> 02:26:48,453
- We can use them without the tube.
- How?

1600
02:26:48,536 --> 02:26:51,498
Fuse-arming wire, set back, heave it!

1601
02:27:07,222 --> 02:27:08,890
Panzer schreck!

1602
02:27:42,966 --> 02:27:45,176
We're going to the Alamo.

1603
02:27:55,437 --> 02:27:57,272
Alamo! Alamo!

1604
02:28:16,833 --> 02:28:19,127
We'll take it! You fall back!

1605
02:28:19,211 --> 02:28:22,839
- You be right behind us!
- Soon as we're in business!

1606
02:28:26,801 --> 02:28:28,887
Displace. Reiben.

1607
02:28:31,389 --> 02:28:32,849
Reload.

1608
02:29:21,648 --> 02:29:23,191
All right, go.

1609
02:29:24,442 --> 02:29:25,527
We're blowing the bridge!

1610
02:29:25,610 --> 02:29:28,530
- Get off! Clear the bridge!
- Displace...

1611
02:29:51,386 --> 02:29:54,389
Sarge! Mike, are you all right?

1612
02:29:54,472 --> 02:29:57,017
- I just got the wind knocked out of me
- Well, get out of here!

1613
02:29:57,100 --> 02:30:00,478
Take cover!
We're going to blow this bridge!

1614
02:30:01,938 --> 02:30:03,690
Come on, come on!

1615
02:30:08,486 --> 02:30:11,323
Tiger coming!
Coming across the bridge!

1616
02:30:43,396 --> 02:30:46,691
Captain, get behind something!

1617
02:30:46,775 --> 02:30:49,444
Come on, Captain, move it!

1618
02:31:12,384 --> 02:31:13,593
Mike.

1619
02:31:18,807 --> 02:31:20,141
Mike!

1620
02:31:59,139 --> 02:32:00,432
Captain.

1621
02:32:03,226 --> 02:32:07,314
Captain, where the hell are you going?
Captain, get back here!

1622
02:34:00,343 --> 02:34:01,678
Upham.

1623
02:34:32,667 --> 02:34:34,878
Hang in there, Captain.

1624
02:35:19,005 --> 02:35:20,715
Medic!

1625
02:35:23,510 --> 02:35:26,054
Medic! We got a medic?

1626
02:35:32,852 --> 02:35:35,730
They're tank-busters, sir. P-51s.

1627
02:35:36,690 --> 02:35:38,900
Angels on our shoulders.

1628
02:35:44,864 --> 02:35:46,575
What, sir?

1629
02:35:51,037 --> 02:35:52,414
James...

1630
02:35:54,207 --> 02:35:55,709
Earn this.

1631
02:35:59,963 --> 02:36:01,423
Earn it.
