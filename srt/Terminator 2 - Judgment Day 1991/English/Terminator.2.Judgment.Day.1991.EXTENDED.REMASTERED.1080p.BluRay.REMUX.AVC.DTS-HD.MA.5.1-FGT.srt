She knew.

413

Cyberdyne will become

The Skynet Funding bill is passed.

Human decisions are removed
from strategic defence.

- Yes.

It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

719

Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

720
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:25,321
Because Skynet knows that
the Russian counterattack

721
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:27,327
will eliminate 
its enemies over here.
