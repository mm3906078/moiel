
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:48,000


2
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:24,208
Three billion human lives ended
on August 29, 1997.

3
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,418
The survivors of the nuclear fire ...

4
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,213
called the war "Judgment Day."

5
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:32,382
They lived only to face
a new nightmare -

6
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,510
the war against the machines.

7
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:56,425
The computer which controlled
the machines, Skynet ...

8
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,511
sent two Terminators
back through time.

9
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:03,640
Their mission: to destroy the leader
of the human resistance.

10
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,560
John Connor, my son.

11
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:14,860
The first Terminator was programmed
to strike at me in the year 1984 ...

12
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,279
before John was born.

13
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,198
It failed.

14
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,117
The second was set to strike
at John himself ...

15
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,661
when he was still a child.

16
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:32,085
As before, the resistance was able
to send a lone warrior ...

17
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,463
a protector for John.

18
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,966
It was just a question of which one
of them would reach him first.

19
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,099
I need your clothes, your boots
and your motorcycle.

20
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,068
You forgot to say please.

21
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,128
Get him off me!

22
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,234
Pull it out!

23
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,965
Take it.

24
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,410
Can't let you take
the man's wheels, son.

25
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,997
Now, get off
before I put you down.

26
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,300
That's it, goddamn it.

27
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,112
R-31 David, Sherman Code 6 ...

28
00:10:56,197 --> 00:11:00,909
at the Sixth Street Bridge and Santa Fe
on electrical disturbance.

29
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,244
Ten-four, R-31 David.

30
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,094
John, get in there and clean up
that pigsty of yours.

31
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,066
Your foster parents
are kind of dicks, huh?

32
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,236
I swear, I have had it
with that goddamn kid.

33
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,947
- He won't even answer me anymore.
- Honey, move.

34
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,950
Would you get off your butt
and help me?

35
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,870
- Todd!
- What?

36
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,290
He hasn't cleaned that room of his
in a month.

37
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,543
Oh, it's an emergency.
Hang on. I'll get right on it.

38
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,469
Come on.

39
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,598
Get your ass inside.
Do what your mother tells you.

40
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,560
She's not my mother, Todd.

41
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,755
This next patient is interesting.

42
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,299
I've been following the case
for years.

43
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,468
A 29-year-old female ...

44
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,473
diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

45
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,810
The usual indicators: depression,
anxiety, violent acting out ...

46
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,603
delusions of persecution.

47
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,405
The delusional architecture
is fairly unique.

48
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,324
She believes that a machine
called the Terminator ...

49
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,744
which looks human,
was sent back through time ...

50
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,872
- to kill her.
- That's original.

51
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,208
And also that the father
of her child ...

52
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,545
was a soldier sent back
to protect her.

53
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,547
He was from the future too.

54
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:47,260
The year 2029,
if I remember correctly.

55
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,596
And here we are.

56
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,472
Morning, Sarah.

57
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:59,772
Good morning, Dr. Silberman.
How's the knee?

58
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,526
Fine, Sarah.

59
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,905
She stabbed me in the kneecap ...

60
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,533
with my pen a few weeks ago.

61
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,118
Repeated escape attempts.

62
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,631
Let's move on, shall we?

63
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:28,051
I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.

64
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:31,512
- See she takes her Thorazine.
- Sure. I'll take care of it.

65
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:47,320
It's time to take your meds, Connor.

66
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,155
You take it.

67
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:52,575
Now you know you gotta be good.
You're up for review this afternoon.

68
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,577
I'm not taking it, Dougie.

69
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,705
- I don't want any trouble.
- Ain't no trouble.

70
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,046
Zap her.

71
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,642
Last call, sugar.

72
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,650
Sweet dreams.

73
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,265
Are you the legal guardian
of John Connor?

74
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:01,018
That's right, Officer.
What's he done now?

75
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:04,063
- Could I speak with him, please?
- You could if he were here.

76
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,024
He took off on his bike this morning.
He could be anywhere.

77
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,402
Do you have a photograph of John?

78
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,737
Yeah. Hold on.

79
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,908
Gonna tell me what this is about?

80
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,578
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

81
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:23,541
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?

82
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:27,128
No, go on. There was a guy here
this morning looking for him too.

83
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,380
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.

84
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,924
Has that got something
to do with this?

85
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,347
I wouldn't worry about him.

86
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,225
Thanks for your cooperation.

87
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:45,271
Please insert your stolen card now.

88
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,280
PIN number.

89
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,074
Hurry up. This is taking too long.

90
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,659
Go, baby.

91
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,704
All right.

92
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,500
- PIN number 9003.
- Where'd you learn this stuff from?

93
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,085
From my mom.
My real mom, I mean.

94
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:12,423
Withdraw 300 bucks.

95
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,259
Come on, baby. Come on!

96
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,595
- Yes!
- Hey, it worked.

97
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,349
All right. Easy money.
Come on!

98
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,978
Yes! Piece of cake.

99
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,362
- Is that her?
- Yes.

100
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,280
She's pretty cool, huh?

101
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,616
No, she's a complete psycho.

102
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,452
That's why she's at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute.

103
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,207
She tried to blow up a computer factory
but got shot and arrested.

104
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,376
No shit.

105
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,462
She's a total loser.

106
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,298
Come on.
Let's go spend some money.

107
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,288
Sarah, wake up.

108
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,088
Kyle.

109
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,134
You're dead.

110
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,261
Where's our son, Sarah?

111
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,514
They took him away from me.

112
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,809
- He's the target now.
- I know.

113
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,936
He's all alone.
You have to protect him.

114
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,480
I know.

115
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,150
You tell me
how I'm supposed to do that.

116
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,360
He doesn't even believe me anymore.

117
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:00,489
- I've lost him.
- You're strong, Sarah.

118
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,992
Stronger than you ever thought
you could be.

119
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,453
On your feet, soldier!

120
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,374
I love you, Sarah.
I always will.

121
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,588
- I need you.
- I'll always be with you.

122
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,970
Remember the message?

123
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,847
The future is not set.

124
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:29,602
There is no fate
but what we make for ourselves.

125
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,499
Stay with me.

126
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:55,336
There's not much time left
in the world, Sarah.

127
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,637
Kyle, don't go!

128
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:34,268
It's like a giant strobe light ...

129
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,687
burning right through my eyes.

130
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,194
Somehow I can still see.

131
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,993
Oh, God.

132
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,792
We know the dream's the same
every night.

133
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:01,295
- Why do I have to --
- Please continue.

134
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,718
Children look like burnt paper.

135
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,472
Black.

136
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,474
Not moving.

137
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,728
And then the blast wave hits them.

138
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,740
And they fly apart like leaves.

139
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,870
Dreams of cataclysm,
the end of the world ...

140
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,872
are very common.

141
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:42,837
It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.

142
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:46,841
- I know the date it happens.
- I'm sure it feels real to you.

143
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,426
On August 29, 1997 ...

144
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:53,013
it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin' real to you too!

145
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,767
Anybody not wearing two-million
sunblock is gonna have a real bad day.

146
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,769
Get it?

147
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,730
God, you think
you're safe and alive.

148
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,108
You're already dead. Everybody!

149
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,694
Him. You. You're dead already.

150
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,655
This whole place,
everything you see is gone!

151
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:13,826
You're the one living in the dream,
'cause I know it happens!

152
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,870
It happens!

153
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,842
I feel much better now.

154
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,802
Clearer.

155
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,680
Yes, your attitude has been ...

156
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,057
much improved lately.

157
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,903
It's helped me to have a goal ...

158
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:52,156
something to look forward to.

159
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,407
What is that?

160
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,826
Well, you said ...

161
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:59,747
that if I showed improvement
after six months ...

162
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,499
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing ...

163
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,336
and I could have visitors.

164
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:11,008
Well, it's been six months and ...

165
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,428
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

166
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,931
I see.

167
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:24,355
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

168
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:28,901
Now you think they don't exist?

169
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:33,113
They don't exist.
I know that now.

170
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,367
But you've told me on many occasions
about how you crushed one ...

171
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,535
in a hydraulic press.

172
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:43,040
If I had, there would have
been some evidence.

173
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:45,542
They would have found something
at the factory.

174
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,711
I see.

175
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:51,215
So you don't believe anymore
that the company covered it up?

176
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,387
No. Why would they?

177
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,723
Let's try a new position
right there.

178
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,151
Mr. Dyson?

179
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:15,656
The materials team
is running another-

180
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,408
- Mr. Dyson.
- Yes?

181
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:20,452
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

182
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,497
You have to sign for the -- it.

183
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:26,417
- You have to sign it out.
- Okay. I'll get it.

184
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,423
I know I haven't been here long,
but I was wondering if you know -

185
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,882
Know what?

186
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,593
If you know where "it" came from.

187
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:40,097
I asked them the same question once.
You know what they told me?

188
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,141
Don't ask.

189
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:51,108
- Good morning, Mr. Dyson.
- How's it going?

190
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:54,111
Insert key. Left on three.

191
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,530
Two, one, turn.

192
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:02,870
- How are the wife and kids?
- Great. Thanks.

193
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,108
So what do you think, Doctor?

194
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,944
Haven't I shown improvement?

195
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,990
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

196
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,494
I know how smart you are.

197
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,621
You're just telling me
what I want to hear.

198
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:49,708
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

199
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:53,712
If I put you in minimum security,
you'll just try to escape again.

200
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,844
You have to let me see my son.

201
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,680
Please.

202
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,854
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

203
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,732
If I could make a phone call --

204
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,276
I'm afraid not.
Not for a while.

205
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,948
I don't see any choice but to
recommend to the review board ...

206
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,617
that you stay here
for another six months.

207
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:30,082
I'll kill you,
you son of a bitch!

208
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,794
You son of a bitch!

209
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:38,424
Ten CCs of sodium amobarbital, stat!

210
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:41,427
- You don't know what you're doing!
- Get some restraints in here now!

211
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,974
You don't know what you're doing!

212
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,105
Model citizen.

213
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,855
You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

214
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:38,108
- He was going to the galleria.
- Yeah.

215
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,985
The galleria?

216
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:28,408
I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right?

217
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,134
- Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?

218
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,641
Hey, do you know this guy?

219
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,893
Nah, I don't know him.

220
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,609
- John.
- Not now.

221
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,946
There's this cop scoping for you.
Check it out.

222
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:10,409
- He's right over there.
- Split, man.

223
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,953
- Just go.
- Yeah.

224
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,917
I saw that kid --

225
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,184
You're not supposed to
be in here!

226
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,128
Get down.

227
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,076
Mister, are you all right?

228
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,412
You all right?

229
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,928
Come on!

230
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,261
Goddamn!

231
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,084
Okay, time-out.
Stop the bike.

232
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,754
Time-out.
Come on, stop the bike.

233
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,561
Holy shit.
Now, don't take this the wrong way.

234
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:19,022
- You are a Terminator, right?
- Yes.

235
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,941
Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.

236
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,455
Holy shit.

237
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,542
You're really real.

238
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,586
I mean --

239
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,050
You're like a machine underneath,
right?

240
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,635
But alive outside?

241
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,637
I'm a cybernetic organism.

242
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,431
Living tissue
over metal endoskeleton.

243
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,406
This is intense.

244
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,284
Get a grip, John. Okay.

245
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,997
You're not here to kill me.

246
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:22,043
I figured that part out for myself.
So what's the deal?

247
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:27,549
- My mission is to protect you.
- Yeah? Who sent you?

248
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,885
You did.
Thirty-five years from now ...

249
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,973
you reprogrammed me to be
your protector here in this time.

250
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,809
Oh, this is deep.

251
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:03,251
So this other guy,
he's a Terminator like you, right?

252
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:07,046
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.

253
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,466
More advanced than you are?

254
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:15,054
- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.
- What the hell does that mean?

255
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:19,392
- Liquid metal.
- Where are we going?

256
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:22,812
We have to get out of the city
immediately and avoid the authorities.

257
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,607
I gotta stop by my house.
I wanna pick up some stuff.

258
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:30,486
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely
try to reacquire you there.

259
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,323
- You sure?
- I would.

260
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,586
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks ...

261
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,340
but I gotta warn 'em.

262
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,800
Shit. You got a quarter?

263
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,562
- Hello.
- Janelle, it's me.

264
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,023
- John?
- Is everything all right?

265
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,525
- Are you guys okay?
- Sure, honey, everything's okay.

266
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,695
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

267
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,366
John, it's late.
I was beginning to worry about you.

268
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,160
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

269
00:42:19,244 --> 00:42:20,787
I'm making beef-stew.

270
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,790
Something's wrong.
She's never this nice.

271
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,667
Where are you?

272
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:28,628
What the hell is
the goddamn dog barking at?

273
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,965
Hey, shut up,
you worthless piece of shit!

274
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,508
The dog's really barking.

275
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,802
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that mutt.

276
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,475
John, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

277
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,268
Could he already be there?

278
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,688
Are you okay?

279
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:50,775
- I'm right here. I'm fine.
- Are you sure you're all right?

280
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:54,195
- What's the dog's name?
- Max.

281
00:42:54,279 --> 00:42:56,614
Hey, Janelle.
What's wrong with Wolfie?

282
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,283
I can hear him barking.
Is he okay?

283
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:03,246
Wolfie's fine, honey.
Wolfie's just fine.

284
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,998
Where are you?

285
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:07,667
Your foster parents are dead.

286
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,540
I need a minute here.

287
00:43:47,624 --> 00:43:51,961
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

288
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,964
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

289
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,466
Get real.

290
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:00,303
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

291
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,305
No, only an object
of equal size.

292
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,766
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

293
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,059
It can't form complex machines.

294
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,187
Guns and explosives
have chemicals, moving parts.

295
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:12,899
It doesn't work that way.
But it can form solid metal shapes.

296
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:16,027
- Like what?
- Knives and stabbing weapons.

297
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,587
Messages from Mom.

298
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:15,688
These were taken by
a video surveillance camera ...

299
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:19,317
at the West Highland Police Station
in 1984.

300
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,820
He killed 17 police officers
that night.

301
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,199
Men with families ...

302
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,202
children.

303
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,206
These were taken at a mall
in Reseda ...

304
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,500
today.

305
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:40,880
Miss Connor, we know you know
who this guy is.

306
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:48,054
I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing ...

307
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,973
that the foster parents
have been murdered.

308
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,808
We know this guy's involved.

309
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:57,188
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

310
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:05,738
We're wasting our time.
Let's go.

311
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:08,366
Sorry, guys.

312
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:12,745
She's grown more disconnected
from reality as time goes on.

313
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:15,039
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

314
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:18,334
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

315
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,044
Sure.

316
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:23,089
Douglas, take her back to her room.

317
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,340
Yes, sir.

318
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:28,010
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

319
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,137
You see ...

320
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:33,432
we spent a lot of time in Nicaragua
and places like that.

321
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:39,021
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy ...

322
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,481
running guns.

323
00:47:40,565 --> 00:47:43,484
Then there were some other guys.

324
00:47:43,568 --> 00:47:45,569
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from ...

325
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:48,906
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

326
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,660
Then she gets busted.

327
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:56,372
It's like, "Sorry, kid, your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?"

328
00:47:58,583 --> 00:48:02,503
Like everything I've been brought up
to believe is all made-up bullshit.

329
00:48:02,587 --> 00:48:04,422
I hated her for that.

330
00:48:08,593 --> 00:48:11,137
But everything she said was true.

331
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,390
She knew ...

332
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,644
and nobody believed her ...

333
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,314
not even me.

334
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,152
Listen. We gotta get her
out of there.

335
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:29,613
Negative. The T-1000's highest
probability for success now ...

336
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:32,742
will be to copy Sarah Connor and wait
for you to make contact with her.

337
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,910
Great. What happens to her?

338
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,872
Typically, the subject being copied
is terminated.

339
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:41,208
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

340
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:43,377
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.

341
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,629
Fuck you!
She's a priority to me!

342
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:51,469
Goddamn it!
What's your problem? Help!

343
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,345
This does not help our mission.

344
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,890
Get this psycho off of me!
Help!

345
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:59,018
I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

346
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,144
Let me go!

347
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,484
Why did you do that?

348
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:08,486
Because you told me to.

349
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,740
What?

350
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,747
You have to do what I say?

351
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:22,041
That's one of my mission parameters.

352
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:26,462
Prove it.
Stand on one foot.

353
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,382
Yes!

354
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:36,180
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

355
00:49:37,682 --> 00:49:38,933
You okay, kid?

356
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,392
Take a hike, bozo.

357
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,062
Let's get outta here, man.

358
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,022
Fuck you, you little dipshit!

359
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,233
Dipshit?

360
00:49:49,402 --> 00:49:51,529
Put your leg down.

361
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:56,450
- Did you call moi a dipshit?
- Just trying to help this punk.

362
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,869
Grab this guy.

363
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,664
Get him off of me!

364
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,833
Now who's the dipshit ...

365
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,709
you jock douche bag?

366
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,263
Put the gun down now!

367
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:20,558
- Get outta here!
- Come on. Let's split!

368
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,441
You were gonna kill that guy!

369
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,694
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

370
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:36,532
Listen to me very carefully, okay?

371
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:39,952
You're not a Terminator anymore,
all right?

372
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:42,454
You got that?

373
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,790
You just can't go around
killing people.

374
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:45,916
Why?

375
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:49,044
What do you mean, why?
'Cause you can't.

376
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,923
Because you just can't.
Trust me on this.

377
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:02,433
Look. I'm gonna go get my mom.

378
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:05,352
I order you to help me.

379
00:53:32,917 --> 00:53:35,336
You have a Sarah Connor here?

380
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,087
You're runnin' kind of late.

381
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,548
They've been in there for an hour.

382
00:53:39,632 --> 00:53:42,051
Hold on a second.
I'll buzz you in.

383
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:47,765
Oh, here come your friends now.

384
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:52,913
- Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

385
00:54:52,997 --> 00:54:56,041
- How 'bout a beer?
- Yeah, right.

386
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:23,152
- Hey, I got a full house.
- That's good, Louis.

387
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:25,487
Must be my lucky day.

388
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:50,799
You're right about number 24.

389
00:57:50,883 --> 00:57:53,885
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

390
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,847
- Same kind?
- Mm-hmm.

391
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,989
You!

392
00:58:16,492 --> 00:58:18,410
You broke my arm.

393
00:58:18,494 --> 00:58:21,288
There are 215 bones
in the human body.

394
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,957
That's one. Now, don't move.

395
00:58:29,922 --> 00:58:31,632
What are you going to do?

396
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:37,220
Why do we stop now?

397
00:58:38,514 --> 00:58:42,309
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

398
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,978
- Right.
- Swear?

399
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,563
What?

400
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:49,733
Just put up your hand and say,
"I swear I won't kill anyone."

401
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,654
I swear I will not kill anyone.

402
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:54,905
All right. Let's go.

403
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:03,914
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00 ...

404
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:06,249
Monday through Friday.

405
00:59:09,962 --> 00:59:11,171
What are you doing?

406
00:59:11,255 --> 00:59:13,882
You son of a bitch!
You shot me!

407
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:16,968
Crazy bastard!

408
00:59:21,265 --> 00:59:23,558
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.

409
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:29,064
He'll live.

410
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,664
Son of a bitch!

411
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,458
Let's try to remain calm.

412
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:50,460
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

413
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,587
There's no way, Connor.
Let him go.

414
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:55,215
- Open the door.
- It ain't gonna happen.

415
00:59:55,299 --> 00:59:57,134
Take it easy, Sarah.

416
00:59:57,218 --> 01:00:00,345
It won't work. You're no killer.
I don't believe you can do it.

417
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,390
You're already dead. Everybody dies.
You know I believe it.

418
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:05,517
So don't fuck with me!

419
01:00:05,601 --> 01:00:07,310
Open the door!

420
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:15,777
Back off?

421
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,279
Get back!

422
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:19,322
I'll pump him full of this shit.
I swear!

423
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:22,701
Don't move!

424
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,036
Drop the shit!

425
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,997
Do it!

426
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:28,999
Get in the office.

427
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:31,126
On the floor, face down.
Not you!

428
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:32,878
Open the door.

429
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:39,176
On the floor. Hold it open.
Face the wall!

430
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:57,027
Get her!

431
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:27,724
Hurry up! Open the door!
The door's locked!

432
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,685
Let's go! Open it!

433
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:35,106
- She broke it off.
- Open it!

434
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,864
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it!

435
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:16,106
Mom, wait!

436
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:23,947
Come back here!

437
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,203
- Help her!
- Wait here.

438
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:32,873
- Hurry up!
- He'll kill us all!

439
01:02:34,166 --> 01:02:35,417
Hold her.

440
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:38,128
He'll kill us all!

441
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:02,652
Mom, are you okay? Mom!

442
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,534
Come with me
if you want to live.

443
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,162
It's okay, Mom.
He's here to help.

444
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:37,896
Go.

445
01:04:10,262 --> 01:04:12,764
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

446
01:04:27,571 --> 01:04:29,406
Get down.

447
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:06,901
Out of the car!

448
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:09,446
Right now!

449
01:05:33,929 --> 01:05:34,971
Go!

450
01:05:46,233 --> 01:05:47,442
I'm out.

451
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:56,159
- Come on.
- Here.

452
01:05:58,662 --> 01:06:00,789
Reload.

453
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:11,674
Last one!

454
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:20,475
Hang on.

455
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,211
Ready!

456
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:03,852
Here, drive.

457
01:07:57,072 --> 01:07:59,282
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

458
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:01,451
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

459
01:08:03,787 --> 01:08:04,954
Can you see anything?

460
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:07,457
I see everything.

461
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:11,961
Cool.

462
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:17,425
Come here.

463
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:24,974
I said I was okay.

464
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,937
John, it was stupid of you
to go there.

465
01:08:29,813 --> 01:08:32,148
You have to be smarter
than that.

466
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:33,816
You were almost killed.

467
01:08:34,985 --> 01:08:36,819
What were you thinking?

468
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:40,240
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me.

469
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:43,534
Do you understand?
You're too important.

470
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:46,287
Do you understand?

471
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:50,291
But ...

472
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:55,672
I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.

473
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:59,300
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.

474
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:08,142
What's wrong with your eyes?

475
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:11,521
Nothing.

476
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:23,908
So, what's your story?

477
01:09:34,461 --> 01:09:35,545
You okay?

478
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:37,046
Fine.

479
01:09:38,882 --> 01:09:42,218
Say, that's a nice bike.

480
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,409
Watch it, lug nuts.

481
01:10:13,917 --> 01:10:17,337
Listen, do you know
what you're doing?

482
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:20,214
I have detailed files
on human anatomy.

483
01:10:21,133 --> 01:10:23,092
I bet.

484
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:26,179
Makes you a more efficient killer,
right?

485
01:10:26,263 --> 01:10:27,388
Correct.

486
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:35,438
Does it hurt
when you get shot?

487
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:39,942
I sense injuries.
The data could be called "pain."

488
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:44,197
John, help me with the light.

489
01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:46,574
- Will these heal up?
- Yes.

490
01:10:46,658 --> 01:10:50,870
Good. If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.

491
01:10:50,954 --> 01:10:53,664
How long do you live?
I mean, last. Whatever.

492
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:57,043
A hundred and twenty years
with my existing power cell.

493
01:10:57,127 --> 01:11:00,046
Can you learn stuff that you
haven't been programmed with ...

494
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,547
so you can be ...

495
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,510
you know, more human ...

496
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:08,304
and not such a dork
all the time?

497
01:11:11,475 --> 01:11:15,019
My CPU is a neural net processor,
a learning computer.

498
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:19,440
But Skynet presets the switch
to read-only when we're sent out alone.

499
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:23,236
Doesn't want you to do
too much thinking, huh?

500
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,654
No.

501
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:28,491
Can we reset the switch?

502
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:50,972
Rotate the two locking cylinders
counter-clockwise.

503
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:58,354
Do it.

504
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,990
Now open the port cover.

505
01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:14,078
Pull to break the seal.

506
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:21,210
Good, now remove
the shock-damping assembly.

507
01:12:24,756 --> 01:12:27,925
You can now access the CPU.

508
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,386
- Do you see it?
- Yes.

509
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:34,390
Hold the CPU by its base tab.

510
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:35,892
Pull.

511
01:13:13,263 --> 01:13:14,972
Do you see the pin switch?

512
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:16,933
No! No!

513
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:20,561
- Out of my way, John.
- Don't kill him.

514
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:23,940
It, John, not him.
It.

515
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:27,485
Okay, it.
But we need it.

516
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:30,196
Listen to me.
You listen.

517
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,406
We're better off on our own.

518
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:34,283
But he's the only proof we have ...

519
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:36,869
of the future and the war
and all that.

520
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:38,329
Maybe.

521
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:43,000
I don't trust it.

522
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:44,794
But he's my friend, all right?

523
01:13:45,629 --> 01:13:48,381
You don't know what it's like
to try to kill one of these things ...

524
01:13:48,465 --> 01:13:52,051
and if something goes wrong
this could be our last chance, so move!

525
01:13:52,135 --> 01:13:54,220
If I'm ever supposed to be
this great military leader ...

526
01:13:54,304 --> 01:13:58,140
maybe you should start listening
to my leadership ideas once in a while.

527
01:14:01,144 --> 01:14:05,773
Because if my own mother won't,
how do you expect anyone else to?

528
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:23,040
All right, play it your way.

529
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:32,550
Was there a problem?

530
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:34,135
No problem.

531
01:14:35,846 --> 01:14:37,054
None whatsoever.

532
01:15:10,714 --> 01:15:12,631
Are we learning yet?

533
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:28,022
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

534
01:15:31,735 --> 01:15:33,361
Just head south.

535
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,704
Keep it under 65.

536
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:46,791
- We don't want to be pulled over.
- Affirmative.

537
01:15:50,003 --> 01:15:52,505
You gotta listen to the way
people talk.

538
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:56,092
You don't say "affirmative"
or some shit like that.

539
01:15:56,176 --> 01:15:58,511
You say, "No problemo."

540
01:15:58,595 --> 01:16:02,515
If someone comes off to you
with an attitude, you say, "Eat me."

541
01:16:02,599 --> 01:16:06,894
And if you want to shine them on,
it's "Hasta la vista, baby."

542
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:12,233
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."

543
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:15,361
If someone gets upset,
you say, "Chill out."

544
01:16:15,445 --> 01:16:16,821
Or you can do combinations.

545
01:16:17,614 --> 01:16:19,907
Chill out, dick-wad.

546
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:22,743
That's great.
See? You're getting it.

547
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:36,841
You got any cash?

548
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:40,469
I got a couple hundred bucks.
I'll give you half.

549
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:42,221
Mom!

550
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:45,391
Get some food.

551
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:49,812
No sense of humor.

552
01:16:55,235 --> 01:16:58,821
That's another thing.
You can lighten up a bit yourself.

553
01:16:59,739 --> 01:17:01,907
This severe routine
is getting old, okay.

554
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:03,826
I mean, you're acting
like such a geek.

555
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:05,911
Smile once in a while.

556
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:07,329
Smile?

557
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:11,333
Yeah, you know, smile.
Watch.

558
01:17:12,335 --> 01:17:16,046
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?

559
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:18,841
Give me a break.

560
01:17:19,759 --> 01:17:21,760
Okay, bad example.

561
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:24,555
See that guy over there?

562
01:17:24,639 --> 01:17:26,515
That's a smile.

563
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:47,328
That's good.

564
01:17:47,412 --> 01:17:50,372
Maybe you could practice
in front of a mirror or something.

565
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,548
Want some of my fries?

566
01:18:09,559 --> 01:18:12,019
- Need any help?
- No.

567
01:18:13,438 --> 01:18:15,189
- I got you!
- No, you didn't!

568
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:26,534
We're not gonna make it, are we?

569
01:18:28,578 --> 01:18:29,787
People, I mean.

570
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:34,792
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

571
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:38,796
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

572
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,132
Break it up before I wring
both of your necks.

573
01:18:43,927 --> 01:18:47,012
I need to know
how Skynet gets built.

574
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:48,347
Who's responsible?

575
01:18:48,431 --> 01:18:51,976
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

576
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:53,769
Who is that?

577
01:18:53,853 --> 01:18:57,773
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

578
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,319
Why him?

579
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:05,781
In a few months, he creates
a revolutionary type of microprocessor.

580
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:08,158
Go on. Then what?

581
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:12,204
In three years Cyberdyne will become
the largest supplier ...

582
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:13,664
of military computer systems.

583
01:19:14,749 --> 01:19:17,668
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers ...

584
01:19:17,752 --> 01:19:19,211
becoming fully unmanned.

585
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:22,339
Afterwards they fly with
a perfect operational record.

586
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:25,050
The Skynet funding bill is passed.

587
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:28,429
The system goes on-line
on August 4, 1997.

588
01:19:28,513 --> 01:19:31,682
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defense.

589
01:19:31,766 --> 01:19:34,476
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

590
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:38,856
It becomes self-aware
at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29.

591
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:42,526
In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.

592
01:19:43,653 --> 01:19:45,904
- Skynet fights back.
- Yes.

593
01:19:45,989 --> 01:19:48,741
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

594
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:51,869
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

595
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:56,332
Skynet knows the Russian counterattack
will eliminate its enemies over here.

596
01:19:56,416 --> 01:19:58,500
Jesus.

597
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:02,504
How much do you know
about Dyson?

598
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:06,675
I have detailed files.

599
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:09,845
I want to know everything.

600
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:15,142
What he looks like,
where he lives, everything.

601
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:32,576
Miles.

602
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:52,221
Are you going to work all day?

603
01:20:52,305 --> 01:20:56,183
I'm sorry, baby.
But this thing is just kicking my ass.

604
01:20:56,267 --> 01:20:57,559
Miles, it's Sunday.

605
01:20:57,644 --> 01:21:00,396
You promised to take the kids
to Raging Waters today.

606
01:21:01,981 --> 01:21:03,482
I can't ...

607
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:05,859
I'm on a roll.

608
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,916
Baby, this is going
to blow them all away.

609
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,086
- It's a neural net processor.
- I know. You told me.

610
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:27,339
It's a neural net processor.
It thinks and learns like we do.

611
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:30,092
It's superconducting
at room temperature.

612
01:21:30,176 --> 01:21:34,430
Other computers are just
pocket calculators by comparison.

613
01:21:36,349 --> 01:21:38,600
But why is that
so goddamn important, Miles?

614
01:21:38,685 --> 01:21:40,018
I really need to know ...

615
01:21:40,103 --> 01:21:43,188
because sometimes I feel
like I'm going crazy here.

616
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:46,859
Baby, I am this close.

617
01:21:47,944 --> 01:21:48,986
Come here.

618
01:21:51,614 --> 01:21:54,116
Imagine a jet airliner ...

619
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,869
with a pilot that never gets tired,
never makes mistakes ...

620
01:21:56,953 --> 01:21:58,829
never shows up to work
with a hangover.

621
01:22:01,207 --> 01:22:03,625
Meet the pilot.

622
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:06,795
Why did we get married, Miles?
Why did we have these children?

623
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:07,921
You don't need us.

624
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:11,425
Your heart and your mind
are in here.

625
01:22:11,509 --> 01:22:14,386
But it doesn't love you
like we do.

626
01:22:22,562 --> 01:22:25,189
I'm sorry. Really.

627
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:29,526
How about spending some time
with your other babies?

628
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:34,031
Raging Waters!

629
01:23:03,686 --> 01:23:05,646
Wait in the car.

630
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:45,686
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

631
01:24:06,457 --> 01:24:08,208
Hey, big John.

632
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:09,960
What's up?

633
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:13,547
He's cool, Enrique.
He's with me.

634
01:24:13,631 --> 01:24:16,800
He's ... Uncle Bob.

635
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:19,094
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

636
01:24:19,178 --> 01:24:20,929
Uncle Bob, huh?

637
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:23,265
Okay.

638
01:24:30,273 --> 01:24:31,315
Drink?

639
01:24:36,654 --> 01:24:38,071
"Uncle Bob"?

640
01:24:40,074 --> 01:24:42,868
You're pretty famous,
all over the goddamn TV.

641
01:24:42,952 --> 01:24:45,621
Pictures of you, John,
your big friend here.

642
01:24:45,705 --> 01:24:47,664
Cops are going nuts
looking for you.

643
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:55,547
I just came for my stuff.
I need clothes, food and a truck.

644
01:24:55,632 --> 01:24:57,674
How about the fillings in my teeth?

645
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:59,927
Now, Enrique.

646
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:03,472
You two,
you're on weapons detail.

647
01:25:03,556 --> 01:25:05,223
Let's go.

648
01:25:25,828 --> 01:25:27,746
One thing about my mom --

649
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:32,000
she always plans ahead.

650
01:25:42,679 --> 01:25:43,887
Excellent.

651
01:25:54,524 --> 01:25:58,193
This is my best truck,
but the starter motor's gone.

652
01:25:58,277 --> 01:26:00,195
You got time to change it out?

653
01:26:00,279 --> 01:26:03,615
Yeah. I'm gonna wait till dark
to cross the border.

654
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,200
Enrique.

655
01:26:05,284 --> 01:26:08,912
It's dangerous for you here.
You get out tonight too, okay?

656
01:26:08,996 --> 01:26:11,456
Sure.

657
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:15,335
Just drop by anytime
and totally fuck up my life, all right?

658
01:26:19,757 --> 01:26:23,218
See, I grew up in places like this ...

659
01:26:23,302 --> 01:26:25,721
so I just thought
that's how people lived --

660
01:26:27,056 --> 01:26:29,766
riding around in helicopters ...

661
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:33,061
learning how to blow shit up.

662
01:26:34,564 --> 01:26:37,232
But then when my mom got busted ...

663
01:26:37,316 --> 01:26:39,693
I got put into a regular school.

664
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:43,113
All the other kids
were into Nintendo.

665
01:26:57,378 --> 01:26:59,504
Are you ever afraid?

666
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:00,881
No.

667
01:27:04,761 --> 01:27:06,553
Not even of dying?

668
01:27:07,096 --> 01:27:09,055
No.

669
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:17,647
You don't feel any emotion about it,
one way or another?

670
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:21,693
No. I have to stay functional
until my mission is complete.

671
01:27:26,699 --> 01:27:29,826
Then it doesn't matter.

672
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:33,622
I have to stay functional too.
"I'm too important."

673
01:27:49,889 --> 01:27:51,765
That's definitely you.

674
01:28:02,318 --> 01:28:05,779
Most of the guys my mom
hung around with were geeks ...

675
01:28:06,155 --> 01:28:09,658
but there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.

676
01:28:09,742 --> 01:28:11,660
He taught me engines.

677
01:28:11,744 --> 01:28:13,912
Hold here.

678
01:28:13,996 --> 01:28:16,414
Mom screwed it up, of course.

679
01:28:16,499 --> 01:28:18,917
She'd always tell 'em
about Judgment Day ...

680
01:28:19,001 --> 01:28:21,795
and me being this world leader.

681
01:28:21,879 --> 01:28:23,839
That'd be all she wrote.

682
01:28:25,174 --> 01:28:26,299
Torque wrench, please.

683
01:28:29,846 --> 01:28:33,056
I wish I could've met
my real dad.

684
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:34,891
You will.

685
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:37,143
Yeah, I guess.

686
01:28:37,228 --> 01:28:41,064
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

687
01:28:41,148 --> 01:28:44,860
They sent him back through time
to 1984.

688
01:28:44,944 --> 01:28:46,361
Man.

689
01:28:47,905 --> 01:28:50,365
He hasn't even been born yet.

690
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:54,077
It messes with your head.

691
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:59,749
- The other bolt.
- Oh. Here.

692
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:09,634
Mom and him were only together
for one night.

693
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:12,178
She still loves him, I guess.

694
01:29:12,263 --> 01:29:15,140
I see her crying sometimes.

695
01:29:15,224 --> 01:29:19,227
She denies it totally, of course,
like she got something stuck in her eye.

696
01:29:24,191 --> 01:29:25,734
Why do you cry?

697
01:29:26,819 --> 01:29:28,320
- You mean people?
- Yeah.

698
01:29:28,404 --> 01:29:29,779
I don't know.

699
01:29:29,864 --> 01:29:31,948
We just cry ...

700
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:34,576
you know, when it hurts.

701
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:42,417
Pain causes it?

702
01:29:43,502 --> 01:29:45,629
No. It's different.

703
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:49,007
It's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyway.

704
01:29:49,091 --> 01:29:50,675
- You get it?
- No.

705
01:29:51,928 --> 01:29:53,637
All right, my man!

706
01:29:55,473 --> 01:29:57,098
Give me five.

707
01:29:59,143 --> 01:30:01,269
Just put out your hand
like this.

708
01:30:02,605 --> 01:30:06,942
All right! Now hit me.
Give me five. Do the same thing.

709
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:14,115
Okay, that's good.
Up high.

710
01:30:15,117 --> 01:30:16,368
Five low.

711
01:30:16,452 --> 01:30:18,119
Too slow.

712
01:30:21,123 --> 01:30:23,375
I'm just kidding.
One more time.

713
01:30:23,459 --> 01:30:25,669
Good. Now try it.

714
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:27,712
Now do me.
Give me five.

715
01:30:29,173 --> 01:30:33,718
Watching John with the machine,
it was suddenly so clear.

716
01:30:33,803 --> 01:30:36,721
The Terminator would never stop.

717
01:30:36,806 --> 01:30:40,767
It would never leave him,
never hurt him ...

718
01:30:40,851 --> 01:30:44,270
never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him ...

719
01:30:44,355 --> 01:30:46,940
or be too busy
to spend time with him.

720
01:30:47,817 --> 01:30:49,901
It would always be there ...

721
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:52,654
and it would die
to protect him.

722
01:30:54,073 --> 01:30:57,409
Of all the would-be fathers
who came and went over the years ...

723
01:30:57,493 --> 01:30:59,536
this thing, this machine ...

724
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,997
was the only one
who measured up.

725
01:31:02,748 --> 01:31:04,582
In an insane world ...

726
01:31:04,667 --> 01:31:06,626
it was the sanest choice.

727
01:32:44,391 --> 01:32:46,351
Hey, let's try this one.

728
01:32:51,982 --> 01:32:54,150
There we go.

729
01:34:40,257 --> 01:34:42,759
She said go south with him
like you planned.

730
01:34:42,843 --> 01:34:45,053
- She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom!

731
01:34:46,847 --> 01:34:48,014
Mom, wait!

732
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:04,739
"No fate."

733
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:08,409
No fate but what we make.

734
01:35:10,537 --> 01:35:12,538
My father told her this.

735
01:35:15,084 --> 01:35:19,379
I made him memorize it in the future
as a message to her.

736
01:35:21,048 --> 01:35:22,966
Never mind.

737
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:26,386
Okay, the whole thing goes-

738
01:35:26,470 --> 01:35:29,180
The future's not set.

739
01:35:29,265 --> 01:35:32,767
There's no fate but what
we make for ourselves.

740
01:35:32,851 --> 01:35:35,853
She intends to change the future.

741
01:35:35,938 --> 01:35:37,397
Yeah, I guess.

742
01:35:38,941 --> 01:35:40,775
Oh, shit!

743
01:35:40,859 --> 01:35:42,777
- Dyson.
- Yeah.

744
01:35:42,861 --> 01:35:46,364
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

745
01:35:46,448 --> 01:35:48,449
She's gonna blow him away.

746
01:35:48,534 --> 01:35:50,618
Come on! Let's go!

747
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:05,049
This is tactically dangerous.

748
01:36:05,134 --> 01:36:06,259
Drive faster.

749
01:36:06,343 --> 01:36:08,845
The T-1000 has the same files
that I do.

750
01:36:08,929 --> 01:36:12,348
It knows what I know.
It might anticipate this move.

751
01:36:12,433 --> 01:36:14,934
I don't care.
We gotta stop her.

752
01:36:15,019 --> 01:36:16,936
Killing Dyson
might prevent the war.

753
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:20,523
I don't care!
Haven't you learned anything yet?

754
01:36:20,607 --> 01:36:23,693
Haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?

755
01:36:26,572 --> 01:36:29,073
Look, maybe you don't care
if you live or die ...

756
01:36:29,158 --> 01:36:31,326
but everybody's not like that.

757
01:36:31,410 --> 01:36:34,996
We have feelings.
We hurt. We're afraid.

758
01:36:37,499 --> 01:36:41,169
You got to learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. It's important.

759
01:37:18,832 --> 01:37:21,459
Danny, I told you to go to bed,
like your sister.

760
01:37:21,543 --> 01:37:24,921
Just a couple of minutes, Mom!

761
01:37:41,063 --> 01:37:43,398
Danny, your time is up!

762
01:37:43,482 --> 01:37:46,401
Come brush your teeth
and get to bed.

763
01:38:28,193 --> 01:38:29,527
Daddy!

764
01:38:29,611 --> 01:38:32,113
Danny, go! Go!

765
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,498
- Tarissa, run!
- Oh, my God!

766
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:51,632
Just take Danny and run!

767
01:38:51,717 --> 01:38:52,967
Run!

768
01:38:53,051 --> 01:38:54,802
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

769
01:39:13,697 --> 01:39:14,697
Daddy!

770
01:39:16,408 --> 01:39:17,867
Nobody fucking move!

771
01:39:18,702 --> 01:39:19,952
Don't hurt my daddy!

772
01:39:20,037 --> 01:39:21,579
On the floor, bitch.

773
01:39:21,663 --> 01:39:23,831
Get down now!

774
01:39:24,708 --> 01:39:25,791
Get out of the way!

775
01:39:25,876 --> 01:39:27,335
Don't hurt him!

776
01:39:28,837 --> 01:39:30,838
Get on the floor now!

777
01:39:33,884 --> 01:39:35,593
Just let the boy go.

778
01:39:35,677 --> 01:39:37,261
Shut up. Shut up.

779
01:39:37,346 --> 01:39:38,638
Shut up!

780
01:39:38,722 --> 01:39:41,307
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

781
01:39:41,391 --> 01:39:43,643
- It's all your fault!
- What?

782
01:39:43,727 --> 01:39:45,853
I'm not gonna let you do it.

783
01:40:37,864 --> 01:40:39,949
Shit! We're too late!

784
01:40:44,454 --> 01:40:45,580
Check them.

785
01:40:49,251 --> 01:40:51,252
Look at me, Mom.

786
01:40:51,336 --> 01:40:53,546
Are you hurt?

787
01:40:57,175 --> 01:40:59,260
I almost --

788
01:41:10,897 --> 01:41:13,232
It'll be okay.

789
01:41:13,317 --> 01:41:15,276
We'll figure something out.
Okay?

790
01:41:16,862 --> 01:41:18,487
I promise.

791
01:41:21,783 --> 01:41:24,744
You came here to stop me.

792
01:41:25,621 --> 01:41:27,580
Yeah, I did.

793
01:41:30,459 --> 01:41:32,460
I love you, John.

794
01:41:34,129 --> 01:41:35,713
I always have.

795
01:41:37,633 --> 01:41:39,050
I know.

796
01:41:46,058 --> 01:41:48,267
Deep penetration.

797
01:41:49,853 --> 01:41:51,771
No shattered bone.

798
01:41:51,855 --> 01:41:54,815
Hold here.
The pressure should stop the bleeding.

799
01:42:05,577 --> 01:42:06,994
Who are you people?

800
01:42:07,954 --> 01:42:09,372
Show him.

801
01:42:12,042 --> 01:42:16,212
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Show me your room.

802
01:42:56,712 --> 01:42:57,920
Oh, my God.

803
01:42:58,004 --> 01:43:00,673
Now listen to me
very carefully.

804
01:43:06,555 --> 01:43:10,683
Dyson listened while the Terminator
laid it all down.

805
01:43:10,767 --> 01:43:14,645
Skynet. Judgment Day.

806
01:43:14,730 --> 01:43:17,022
The history of things to come.

807
01:43:18,442 --> 01:43:21,193
It's not every day that
you find out you're responsible ...

808
01:43:21,278 --> 01:43:24,113
for three billion deaths.

809
01:43:24,197 --> 01:43:26,115
He took it pretty well.

810
01:43:28,118 --> 01:43:30,578
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

811
01:43:36,585 --> 01:43:38,711
You're judging me ...

812
01:43:38,795 --> 01:43:41,255
on things I haven't even done yet.

813
01:43:45,469 --> 01:43:47,595
How were we supposed to know?

814
01:43:50,056 --> 01:43:52,016
Yeah.

815
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:54,477
Right.

816
01:43:54,561 --> 01:43:56,687
How were you supposed to know?

817
01:43:57,731 --> 01:44:01,442
Fucking men like you
built the hydrogen bomb.

818
01:44:01,526 --> 01:44:04,111
Men like you ...

819
01:44:04,196 --> 01:44:05,613
thought it up.

820
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:11,452
You think you're so creative.

821
01:44:12,871 --> 01:44:15,956
You don't know what it's like
to really create something ...

822
01:44:16,041 --> 01:44:18,167
to create a life ...

823
01:44:18,251 --> 01:44:19,794
to feel it growing inside you.

824
01:44:19,878 --> 01:44:22,797
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

825
01:44:22,881 --> 01:44:24,548
Mom!

826
01:44:24,633 --> 01:44:28,385
We need to be a little more
constructive here. Okay?

827
01:44:28,470 --> 01:44:30,554
We still have to stop this
from happening, don't we?

828
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:33,474
But I thought --

829
01:44:33,558 --> 01:44:37,561
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

830
01:44:37,646 --> 01:44:42,441
That's right. There's no way I'm going
to finish the new processor. Not now.

831
01:44:42,526 --> 01:44:45,986
Forget it. I'm out of it.
I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.

832
01:44:46,071 --> 01:44:47,947
That's not good enough.

833
01:44:48,031 --> 01:44:49,949
No one must follow your work.

834
01:44:50,033 --> 01:44:51,909
Right.

835
01:44:51,993 --> 01:44:56,330
All right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab --

836
01:44:56,414 --> 01:44:57,998
the files, the disk drives ...

837
01:44:58,083 --> 01:45:00,709
everything here.

838
01:45:00,794 --> 01:45:02,878
Everything.

839
01:45:02,963 --> 01:45:04,880
I don't care.

840
01:45:06,174 --> 01:45:07,174
The chip.

841
01:45:07,259 --> 01:45:09,343
- Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

842
01:45:09,427 --> 01:45:11,846
It's at Cyberdyne.
It's from the other one like you.

843
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:14,640
The CPU from the first Terminator.

844
01:45:14,724 --> 01:45:17,101
Son of a bitch!
I knew it!

845
01:45:17,185 --> 01:45:19,895
They told us not to ask
where they got it.

846
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:22,314
Those lying motherfuckers.

847
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:24,191
It's scary stuff.
Radically advanced.

848
01:45:24,276 --> 01:45:25,401
It was smashed.

849
01:45:25,485 --> 01:45:29,113
It didn't work, but it gave us ideas,
took us in new directions.

850
01:45:29,197 --> 01:45:31,198
Things we would've never-

851
01:45:33,368 --> 01:45:35,452
All my work was based on it.

852
01:45:35,537 --> 01:45:37,371
It must be destroyed.

853
01:45:39,624 --> 01:45:42,626
Can you get us in?
Past security?

854
01:45:42,711 --> 01:45:44,795
I think so, yeah. When?

855
01:45:49,718 --> 01:45:50,718
Now?

856
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:57,683
The future,
always so clear to me ...

857
01:45:57,767 --> 01:46:00,769
had become like
a black highway at night.

858
01:46:00,854 --> 01:46:03,564
We were in
uncharted territory now ...

859
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:06,567
making up history
as we went along.

860
01:46:44,898 --> 01:46:46,815
Carl, right?

861
01:46:48,151 --> 01:46:51,570
Friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd ...

862
01:46:51,655 --> 01:46:53,656
take 'em upstairs
and show 'em around.

863
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:57,034
Mr. Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

864
01:46:57,118 --> 01:46:59,286
I need written authorization --

865
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:02,331
I insist.

866
01:47:02,415 --> 01:47:04,166
Don't even think about it.

867
01:47:15,136 --> 01:47:16,595
It's okay.

868
01:47:18,014 --> 01:47:21,141
It takes two keys, turned
simultaneously, to open the vault.

869
01:47:21,226 --> 01:47:24,144
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

870
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:26,939
Gibbons?

871
01:47:29,985 --> 01:47:31,819
Gibbons! Come on, man!

872
01:47:31,903 --> 01:47:34,989
You can't leave the desk
like that!

873
01:47:39,828 --> 01:47:41,328
Oh, shit.

874
01:47:58,888 --> 01:48:00,889
My card should access this.

875
01:48:05,562 --> 01:48:07,980
- What is it?
- Damn it.

876
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:10,024
The silent alarm's been tripped.

877
01:48:16,197 --> 01:48:18,949
It's neutralized all the codes
in the entire building.

878
01:48:19,034 --> 01:48:20,951
Nothing will open anywhere now.

879
01:48:22,037 --> 01:48:23,871
We have to abort.

880
01:48:27,083 --> 01:48:30,502
We go all the way.
Okay?

881
01:48:32,630 --> 01:48:36,425
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

882
01:48:36,509 --> 01:48:38,969
- I think it's that guy from the mall.
- It is.

883
01:48:39,054 --> 01:48:40,971
It's him and the woman.

884
01:48:42,557 --> 01:48:45,726
Just send everything
you got in the area right now.

885
01:48:47,937 --> 01:48:51,398
I have a personal entry code
for the lab. It may still work.

886
01:48:55,904 --> 01:48:56,945
It's no good.

887
01:48:57,030 --> 01:48:58,572
Let me try mine.

888
01:49:03,536 --> 01:49:05,621
John, fire in the hole!

889
01:49:17,675 --> 01:49:22,471
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the Halon system.

890
01:49:29,646 --> 01:49:32,106
You have to wait
until the gas clears.

891
01:49:34,609 --> 01:49:35,901
Put this on.

892
01:49:49,874 --> 01:49:52,376
All right, let's get to work.

893
01:50:13,565 --> 01:50:16,859
All units in the vicinity
and all units able to respond ...

894
01:50:16,943 --> 01:50:21,738
a 211 in progress, 2144 Kramer Street,
the Cyberdyne building.

895
01:50:21,823 --> 01:50:23,490
Suspect one is white female ...

896
01:50:23,575 --> 01:50:27,035
identified as last name Connor,
first name Sarah.

897
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:30,038
Escaped last night
from Pescadero State Hospital.

898
01:50:30,123 --> 01:50:31,999
Suspect two: White male ...

899
01:50:35,753 --> 01:50:37,880
All the disks in my office ...

900
01:50:37,964 --> 01:50:40,090
all the disks
in that office over there ...

901
01:50:40,175 --> 01:50:42,176
everything behind my desk ...

902
01:50:42,260 --> 01:50:44,511
and all the processors
on my left.

903
01:50:44,596 --> 01:50:47,181
We'll blow those with the C4.

904
01:51:00,778 --> 01:51:02,821
Can I --

905
01:51:02,906 --> 01:51:04,698
Excuse me.

906
01:51:06,367 --> 01:51:08,994
Can I borrow that thing?

907
01:51:18,129 --> 01:51:20,422
I worked a lot of years on this thing.

908
01:51:24,594 --> 01:51:26,637
One-Mary-23,
give me that location again.

909
01:51:26,721 --> 01:51:28,472
2111 Kramer.

910
01:51:28,556 --> 01:51:31,683
Suspects are armed and
considered extremely dangerous.

911
01:52:23,945 --> 01:52:25,737
All right.

912
01:52:25,822 --> 01:52:27,614
7-2-5-6.

913
01:52:34,455 --> 01:52:35,789
Easy money.

914
01:52:44,882 --> 01:52:47,300
Oh, shit. Not good.

915
01:52:52,390 --> 01:52:54,016
How we doing?

916
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:55,767
Primer cord is set.

917
01:52:55,852 --> 01:52:58,311
One more barrel,
two more minutes.

918
01:53:02,191 --> 01:53:05,110
- How do we set them off?
- Remote control.

919
01:53:05,194 --> 01:53:07,571
Piece of cake.

920
01:53:07,655 --> 01:53:09,197
- We got company.
- Police?

921
01:53:09,282 --> 01:53:12,617
- How many?
- All of 'em, I think.

922
01:53:12,702 --> 01:53:14,119
Go. I'll finish here.

923
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:17,497
Come on.

924
01:53:18,583 --> 01:53:20,500
I'll take care of the police.

925
01:53:20,585 --> 01:53:21,877
Wait! You swore!

926
01:53:24,839 --> 01:53:26,298
Trust me.

927
01:53:39,562 --> 01:53:41,188
You at the window!

928
01:53:41,272 --> 01:53:44,733
Drop your weapon and place
your hands on top of your head!

929
01:53:46,069 --> 01:53:47,903
Holy shit!

930
01:53:47,987 --> 01:53:49,529
That's a mini-gun!

931
01:54:11,761 --> 01:54:14,096
- Come on!
- Oh, shit!

932
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:15,722
Go! Go! Go!

933
01:55:03,312 --> 01:55:04,771
Fire!

934
01:55:22,123 --> 01:55:23,748
Same time, to the left.

935
01:55:23,833 --> 01:55:26,168
One, two, three, go.

936
01:55:38,306 --> 01:55:41,141
In order to get that out --

937
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:50,692
We got Skynet by the balls now.

938
01:55:50,776 --> 01:55:52,485
Come on, let's book.

939
01:55:53,404 --> 01:55:55,322
Hold your fire!

940
01:56:20,514 --> 01:56:23,016
- Ready to rock?
- Ready.

941
01:56:25,770 --> 01:56:27,062
Time to go.

942
01:56:27,146 --> 01:56:28,605
Now.

943
01:56:28,689 --> 01:56:32,234
- Take this. They'll use gas.
- Come on.

944
01:56:32,318 --> 01:56:35,403
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

945
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:02,430
Mom! Mom!

946
01:57:46,809 --> 01:57:47,934
Shit!

947
01:57:49,353 --> 01:57:52,272
She's in the clean room.
There's no way outta there.

948
01:58:01,782 --> 01:58:02,782
Get down!

949
01:58:10,291 --> 01:58:11,708
Here.

950
01:58:37,234 --> 01:58:40,653
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

951
01:58:44,825 --> 01:58:46,326
Fall back!

952
01:58:46,410 --> 01:58:47,994
Everybody out!

953
01:58:48,079 --> 01:58:49,996
Fall back now!
Go! Go! Go!

954
01:59:25,408 --> 01:59:27,367
We got a war zone here!

955
01:59:59,275 --> 02:00:00,984
Shut your eyes.

956
02:00:07,575 --> 02:00:10,743
Stay here. I'll be back.

957
02:00:18,586 --> 02:00:20,920
Get down on the floor!
Face down!

958
02:00:23,632 --> 02:00:25,216
On the floor now!

959
02:00:27,553 --> 02:00:29,053
Okay, drop him!

960
02:01:48,926 --> 02:01:50,343
Here, hold this.

961
02:02:23,752 --> 02:02:24,752
Go!

962
02:03:03,709 --> 02:03:04,626
Shit!

963
02:03:18,223 --> 02:03:19,932
Get out.

964
02:03:38,952 --> 02:03:40,244
Listen.

965
02:03:40,329 --> 02:03:43,039
No matter what happens,
stay under these vests.

966
02:03:43,123 --> 02:03:44,374
- You got it?
- Yeah.

967
02:03:44,458 --> 02:03:45,917
All right.

968
02:04:00,474 --> 02:04:01,724
Chopper's coming in!

969
02:04:01,809 --> 02:04:02,934
It's him.

970
02:05:00,701 --> 02:05:02,034
Shit!

971
02:05:04,913 --> 02:05:06,706
Stay down!

972
02:06:20,989 --> 02:06:23,449
Goddamn! You all right?

973
02:06:30,958 --> 02:06:33,376
Come on, Mom,
we gotta get out.

974
02:06:35,295 --> 02:06:36,921
Take the shotgun.

975
02:06:40,175 --> 02:06:41,759
Are you hurt?

976
02:06:54,940 --> 02:06:57,859
Holy shit.
Come on, Mom. Come on!

977
02:06:57,943 --> 02:07:00,653
- We need your truck.
- Hurry!

978
02:07:05,659 --> 02:07:08,160
- Come on. Hurry.
- Get in.

979
02:07:11,164 --> 02:07:12,373
Go!

980
02:07:18,380 --> 02:07:20,381
What the hell --

981
02:07:26,263 --> 02:07:29,015
- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

982
02:07:30,684 --> 02:07:32,351
Here. This'll work.

983
02:07:37,941 --> 02:07:39,650
He's gaining.

984
02:07:42,195 --> 02:07:43,863
Step on it!

985
02:07:43,947 --> 02:07:46,741
- This is the vehicle's top speed.
- I can run faster than this!

986
02:07:57,586 --> 02:07:59,045
Coming up, to the right.

987
02:08:01,089 --> 02:08:03,049
Watch it! Watch it!

988
02:08:25,614 --> 02:08:27,740
- Drive.
- Where are you going?

989
02:08:35,207 --> 02:08:37,124
Take the off-ramp.

990
02:08:46,802 --> 02:08:47,969
Shit!

991
02:08:51,139 --> 02:08:52,223
Hold on!

992
02:09:38,061 --> 02:09:39,687
Don't stop!

993
02:09:47,529 --> 02:09:48,946
Go straight!

994
02:09:51,575 --> 02:09:53,868
- Look out!
- Duck!

995
02:10:08,008 --> 02:10:09,967
Get the hell outta here!

996
02:10:15,474 --> 02:10:18,517
Get outta here!
Let's go! Come on!

997
02:11:35,512 --> 02:11:37,972
Hasta la vista, baby.

998
02:12:27,564 --> 02:12:28,981
We don't have much time.

999
02:12:51,588 --> 02:12:52,838
Let's go.

1000
02:12:53,924 --> 02:12:55,716
We gotta get outta here.

1001
02:12:55,800 --> 02:12:57,885
Come on! Get up!

1002
02:13:11,483 --> 02:13:13,192
Hand me the shotgun.

1003
02:13:18,031 --> 02:13:20,324
Put your weight on me, Mom.

1004
02:13:21,117 --> 02:13:23,035
Hurry!

1005
02:13:26,581 --> 02:13:28,207
Come on, Mom.

1006
02:13:34,714 --> 02:13:36,048
Get up!

1007
02:14:07,580 --> 02:14:09,540
This way. Come on.

1008
02:14:36,568 --> 02:14:38,235
No! Wait!

1009
02:14:38,528 --> 02:14:42,448
Wait. No. No.
It's too hot. Go back.

1010
02:14:50,665 --> 02:14:52,916
- Go. Run.
- No! We gotta stick together.

1011
02:14:53,001 --> 02:14:55,002
John, you've got to go now.

1012
02:14:55,086 --> 02:14:57,254
- John!
- Go! Now!

1013
02:16:11,704 --> 02:16:13,497
Get up the steps.

1014
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:22,381
Get up.

1015
02:16:23,174 --> 02:16:25,342
Come on, Mom.
I got you.

1016
02:16:59,752 --> 02:17:02,087
Grab the chain. Grab it.

1017
02:17:03,465 --> 02:17:06,216
Grab it. Go. Go!

1018
02:17:16,561 --> 02:17:19,897
Mom, come on! Mom!

1019
02:18:09,030 --> 02:18:10,822
Call to John.

1020
02:18:13,618 --> 02:18:15,494
I know this hurts.

1021
02:18:17,288 --> 02:18:18,956
Call John.

1022
02:18:35,348 --> 02:18:38,016
Call to John now.

1023
02:18:40,019 --> 02:18:41,895
Fuck you.

1024
02:21:59,427 --> 02:22:00,886
Help!

1025
02:22:21,532 --> 02:22:23,116
Mom.

1026
02:22:28,331 --> 02:22:30,707
- Help me.
- Get out of the way, John.

1027
02:22:31,667 --> 02:22:33,919
- John! John!
- Shoot!

1028
02:23:29,934 --> 02:23:32,352
Get down!

1029
02:25:05,655 --> 02:25:07,822
Get up. Come on.

1030
02:25:10,076 --> 02:25:11,868
Holy shit.

1031
02:25:11,953 --> 02:25:14,412
I need a vacation.

1032
02:25:27,635 --> 02:25:30,428
Is it dead?

1033
02:25:30,513 --> 02:25:31,930
Terminated.

1034
02:25:35,434 --> 02:25:37,102
Will this melt in there?

1035
02:25:40,064 --> 02:25:41,940
Yes. Throw it in.

1036
02:25:49,031 --> 02:25:50,949
And the chip.

1037
02:26:06,132 --> 02:26:07,757
It's over.

1038
02:26:14,598 --> 02:26:16,266
There's one more chip.

1039
02:26:20,938 --> 02:26:23,189
And it must be destroyed also.

1040
02:26:28,654 --> 02:26:30,238
Here.

1041
02:26:30,322 --> 02:26:33,700
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

1042
02:26:46,839 --> 02:26:49,299
I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.

1043
02:26:49,383 --> 02:26:51,676
No, it'll be okay.
Stay with us.

1044
02:26:51,761 --> 02:26:53,762
- It'll be okay.
- I have to go away.

1045
02:26:53,846 --> 02:26:56,431
No, don't do it.
Please, don't go.

1046
02:26:56,515 --> 02:26:59,601
I must go away, John.

1047
02:26:59,685 --> 02:27:01,144
No, wait.

1048
02:27:01,228 --> 02:27:04,147
- You don't have to do this.
- I'm sorry.

1049
02:27:05,066 --> 02:27:07,317
No, don't do it! Don't go!

1050
02:27:07,401 --> 02:27:09,360
It has to end here.

1051
02:27:10,571 --> 02:27:13,865
I order you not to go!

1052
02:27:21,832 --> 02:27:23,875
I know now why you cry.

1053
02:27:26,253 --> 02:27:28,713
But it's something
I can never do.

1054
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:05,250
Good-bye.

1055
02:29:44,475 --> 02:29:48,728
August 29, 1997, came and went.

1056
02:29:48,812 --> 02:29:53,149
Nothing much happened.
Michael Jackson turned 40.

1057
02:29:53,233 --> 02:29:55,318
There was no Judgment Day.

1058
02:29:55,402 --> 02:29:58,613
People went to work
as they always do.

1059
02:29:58,697 --> 02:30:04,577
Laughed, complained,
watched TV, made love.

1060
02:30:04,662 --> 02:30:06,621
I wanted to run
through the street yelling ...

1061
02:30:06,705 --> 02:30:12,001
to grab them all and say,
"Every day from this day on is a gift.

1062
02:30:12,086 --> 02:30:14,379
Use it well."

1063
02:30:14,463 --> 02:30:16,965
Instead, I got drunk.

1064
02:30:17,049 --> 02:30:19,842
That was 30 years ago.

1065
02:30:19,927 --> 02:30:24,389
But the dark future which never came
still exists for me.

1066
02:30:24,473 --> 02:30:28,184
And it always will,
like the traces of a dream.

1067
02:30:30,521 --> 02:30:34,399
John fights the war differently
than it was foretold.

1068
02:30:34,483 --> 02:30:37,318
Here, on the battlefield
of the Senate ...

1069
02:30:37,403 --> 02:30:40,029
his weapons are common sense ...

1070
02:30:40,781 --> 02:30:42,949
and hope.

1071
02:30:44,034 --> 02:30:46,160
Tie me, Grandma. Tie me!

1072
02:30:54,044 --> 02:30:56,212
- How's that?
- Thank you, Grandma.

1073
02:30:59,967 --> 02:31:02,051
The luxury of hope ...

1074
02:31:02,136 --> 02:31:04,846
was given to me
by the Terminator.

1075
02:31:06,056 --> 02:31:10,977
Because if a machine can learn
the value of human life ...

1076
02:31:11,979 --> 02:35:26,173
maybe we can too.

1077
02:35:26,198 --> 02:36:06,198
