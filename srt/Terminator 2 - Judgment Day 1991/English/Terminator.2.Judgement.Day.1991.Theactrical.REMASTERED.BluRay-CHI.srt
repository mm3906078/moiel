a psycho. Didn't you know?"

I need to know how Skynet gets built,
who's responsible.

609
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:07,172
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

610
01:08:08,092 --> 01:08:09,208
<b><font color="#404040">JOHN:</font></b> Who is that?

611
01:08:09,427 --> 01:08:12,545
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

612
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:17,466
Why him?

613
01:08:17,685 --> 01:08:21,387
In a few months he creates
a revolutionary type of microprocessor.

614
01:08:22,148 --> 01:08:25,391
- Go on. Then what?
- In three years,

615
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:29,020
Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier
of military computer systems.

616
01:08:30,031 --> 01:08:32,819
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers,

617
01:08:33,034 --> 01:08:34,366
becoming fully unmanned.

618
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:37,695
Afterwards, they fly
with a perfect operational record.

619
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:40,281
The Skynet Funding bill is passed.

620
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,789
The system goes on-line on August 4, 1997.

621
01:08:44,003 --> 01:08:46,916
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defence.

622
01:08:47,131 --> 01:08:49,839
Skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate.

623
01:08:50,051 --> 01:08:54,216
It becomes self-aware at 02:14am
Eastern time, August 29.

624
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:57,723
In a panic, they try to pull the plug.

625
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:01,268
- Skynet fights back.
- Yes.

626
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:03,971
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

627
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:07,228
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

628
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:09,685
Because Skynet knows
that the Russian counterattack

629
01:09:09,904 --> 01:09:11,691
will eliminate its enemies over here.

630
01:09:11,906 --> 01:09:13,397
