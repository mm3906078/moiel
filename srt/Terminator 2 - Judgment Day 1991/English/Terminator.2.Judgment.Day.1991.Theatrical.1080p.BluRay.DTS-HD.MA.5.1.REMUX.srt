1
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:24,210
<i>Three billion human lives ended
on August 29, 1997.</i>

2
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:26,420
<i>The survivors of the nuclear fire...</i>

3
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:29,215
<i>called the war "Judgment Day."</i>

4
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:32,384
<i>They lived only to face
a new nightmare...</i>

5
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:34,512
<i>the war against the machines.</i>

6
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:56,427
<i>The computer which controlled
the machines, Skynet...</i>

7
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,513
<i>sent two Terminators
back through time.</i>

8
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:03,642
<i>Their mission: to destroy the leader
of the human resistance.</i>

9
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:06,562
<i>John Connor, my son.</i>

10
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:14,862
<i>The first Terminator was programmed
to strike at me in the year 1984...</i>

11
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,281
<i>before John was born.</i>

12
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,200
<i>It failed.</i>

13
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:22,119
<i>The second was set to strike
at John himself...</i>

14
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:24,663
<i>when he was still a child.</i>

15
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:32,087
<i>As before, the resistance was able
to send a lone warrior...</i>

16
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:34,465
<i>a protector for John.</i>

17
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,968
<i>It was just a question of which one
of them would reach him first.</i>

18
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:56,101
I need your clothes, your boots
and your motorcycle.

19
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,070
You forgot to say please.

20
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,130
Get him off me!

21
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,236
Pull it out!

22
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,967
Take it.

23
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,412
Can't let you take
the man's wheels, son.

24
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,999
Now, get off
before I put you down.

25
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,302
That's it, goddamn it.

26
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:56,114
R-31 David, Sherman Code 6...

27
00:10:56,198 --> 00:11:00,911
at the Sixth Street Bridge and Santa Fe
on electrical disturbance.

28
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,246
<i>Ten-four, R-31 David.</i>

29
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:43,096
John, get in there and clean up
that pigsty of yours.

30
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,068
Your foster parents
are kind of dicks, huh?

31
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:00,238
I swear, I have had it
with that goddamn kid.

32
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,949
- He won't even answer me anymore.
- Honey, move.

33
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,952
Would you get off your butt
and help me?

34
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,872
- Todd!
- What?

35
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,292
He hasn't cleaned that room of his
in a month.

36
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,545
Oh, it's an emergency.
Hang on. I'll get right on it.

37
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,471
Come on.

38
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:28,600
Get your ass inside.
Do what your mother tells you.

39
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,562
She's not my mother, Todd.

40
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,757
<i>This next patient is interesting.</i>

41
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,301
I've been following the case
for years.

42
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,470
A 29-year-old female...

43
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:10,475
diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

44
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,812
The usual indicators: depression,
anxiety, violent acting out...

45
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,605
delusions of persecution.

46
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:25,407
<i>The delusional architecture
is fairly unique.</i>

47
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,326
She believes that a machine
called the Terminator...

48
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,746
which looks human,
was sent back through time...

49
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,874
- to kill her.
- That's original.

50
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:37,210
And also that the father
of her child...

51
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:40,547
was a soldier sent back
to protect her.

52
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,549
He was from the future too.

53
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:47,262
The year 2029,
if I remember correctly.

54
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,598
And here we are.

55
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,474
<i>Morning, Sarah.</i>

56
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:59,774
Good morning, Dr. Silberman.
How's the knee?

57
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,528
<i>Fine, Sarah.</i>

58
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,907
She stabbed me in the kneecap...

59
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,535
with my pen a few weeks ago.

60
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,120
Repeated escape attempts.

61
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,633
Let's move on, shall we?

62
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:28,053
I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.

63
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:31,514
- See she takes her Thorazine.
- Sure. I'll take care of it.

64
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,082
Are you the legal guardian
of John Connor?

65
00:15:57,374 --> 00:16:00,835
That's right, Officer.
What's he done now?

66
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,880
- Could I speak with him, please?
- You could if he were here.

67
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,841
He took off on his bike this morning.
He could be anywhere.

68
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:09,219
Do you have a photograph of John?

69
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,553
Yeah. Hold on.

70
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,725
Gonna tell me what this is about?

71
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,395
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

72
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:23,358
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?

73
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,945
No, go on. There was a guy here
this morning looking for him too.

74
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,197
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.

75
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,741
Has that got something
to do with this?

76
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:38,164
I wouldn't worry about him.

77
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:41,042
Thanks for your cooperation.

78
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:45,088
Please insert your stolen card now.

79
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,097
PIN number.

80
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,891
Hurry up. This is taking too long.

81
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,476
Go, baby.

82
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,521
All right.

83
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:05,316
- PIN number 9003.
- Where'd you learn this stuff from?

84
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,902
From my mom.
My real mom, I mean.

85
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:12,240
Withdraw 300 bucks.

86
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,076
Come on, baby. Come on!

87
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,412
- Yes!
- Hey, it worked.

88
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:21,166
All right. Easy money.
Come on!

89
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,795
Yes! Piece of cake.

90
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,179
- Is that her?
- Yes.

91
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,097
She's pretty cool, huh?

92
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,433
No, she's a complete psycho.

93
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,269
That's why she's at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute.

94
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:46,024
She tried to blow up a computer factory
but got shot and arrested.

95
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,193
No shit.

96
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:51,279
She's a total loser.

97
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:54,115
Come on.
Let's go spend some money.

98
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:13,009
<i>It's like a giant strobe light...</i>

99
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,428
<i>burning right through my eyes.</i>

100
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,935
<i>Somehow I can still see.</i>

101
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,734
<i>Oh, God.</i>

102
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:36,616
<i>We know the dream's the same
every night.</i>

103
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:40,119
<i>- Why do I have to...
- Please continue.</i>

104
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,543
<i>Children look like burnt paper.</i>

105
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,296
<i>Black.</i>

106
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,298
<i>Not moving.</i>

107
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,553
<i>And then the blast wave hits them.</i>

108
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,565
<i>And they fly apart like leaves.</i>

109
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,695
<i>Dreams of cataclysm,
the end of the world...</i>

110
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,697
<i>are very common.</i>

111
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:21,661
<i>It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.</i>

112
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:25,665
<i>- I know the date it happens.
- I'm sure it feels real to you.</i>

113
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,251
<i>On August 29, 1997...</i>

114
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,838
<i>it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin' real to you too!</i>

115
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:35,592
<i>Anybody not wearing two-million
sunblock is gonna have a real bad day.</i>

116
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,594
<i>Get it?</i>

117
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,555
<i>God, you think
you're safe and alive.</i>

118
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,932
<i>You're already dead. Everybody!</i>

119
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,518
<i>Him. You. You're dead already.</i>

120
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:48,479
<i>This whole place,
everything you see is gone!</i>

121
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:52,650
<i>You're the one living in the dream,
'cause I know it happens!</i>

122
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,694
<i>It happens!</i>

123
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,666
I feel much better now.

124
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,627
Clearer.

125
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,504
Yes, your attitude has been...

126
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,882
much improved lately.

127
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,727
It's helped me to have a goal...

128
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,980
something to look forward to.

129
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,231
What is that?

130
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,651
Well, you said...

131
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:38,571
that if I showed improvement
after six months...

132
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:41,324
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing...

133
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,160
and I could have visitors.

134
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:49,832
Well, it's been six months and...

135
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,252
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

136
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,755
I see.

137
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:03,179
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

138
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:07,725
Now you think they don't exist?

139
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:11,938
They don't exist.
I know that now.

140
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:15,191
But you've told me on many occasions
about how you crushed one...

141
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,360
in a hydraulic press.

142
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,864
If I had, there would have
been some evidence.

143
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:24,367
They would have found something
at the factory.

144
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,536
I see.

145
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:30,039
<i>So you don't believe anymore
that the company covered it up?</i>

146
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,211
<i>No. Why would they?</i>

147
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,548
Let's try a new position
right there.

148
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,976
Mr. Dyson?

149
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:54,480
The materials team
is running another...

150
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:56,232
- Mr. Dyson.
- Yes?

151
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,277
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

152
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,321
You have to sign for the... it.

153
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:05,241
- You have to sign it out.
- Okay. I'll get it.

154
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:11,247
I know I haven't been here long,
but I was wondering if you know...

155
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,707
Know what?

156
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,418
If you know where "it" came from.

157
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,921
I asked them the same question once.
You know what they told me?

158
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,965
Don't ask.

159
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:29,932
- Good morning, Mr. Dyson.
- How's it going?

160
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,935
Insert key. Left on three.

161
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,354
Two, one, turn.

162
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:41,694
- How are the wife and kids?
- Great. Thanks.

163
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,933
So what do you think, Doctor?

164
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,769
Haven't I shown improvement?

165
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,815
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

166
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,318
I know how smart you are.

167
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,445
You're just telling me
what I want to hear.

168
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:28,533
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

169
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:32,537
If I put you in minimum security,
you'll just try to escape again.

170
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,669
You have to let me see my son.

171
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,505
Please.

172
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,679
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

173
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:52,557
If I could make a phone call...

174
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,101
I'm afraid not.
Not for a while.

175
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,772
I don't see any choice but to
recommend to the review board...

176
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:02,441
that you stay here
for another six months.

177
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,906
I'll kill you,
you son of a bitch!

178
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,618
You son of a bitch!

179
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:17,248
Ten CCs of sodium amobarbital, stat!

180
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:20,251
- You don't know what you're doing!
- Get some restraints in here now!

181
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:25,798
You don't know what you're doing!

182
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,929
<i>Model citizen.</i>

183
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,679
You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

184
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:16,933
- He was going to the galleria.
- Yeah.

185
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,809
The galleria?

186
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:07,233
I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right?

187
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:24,959
- Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?

188
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:31,465
Hey, do you know this guy?

189
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:33,718
Nah, I don't know him.

190
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:41,434
- John.
- Not now.

191
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:44,770
There's this cop scoping for you.
Check it out.

192
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,233
- He's right over there.
- Split, man.

193
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,777
- Just go.
- Yeah.

194
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,742
I saw that kid...

195
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,009
You're not supposed to
be in here!

196
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:41,952
Get down.

197
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,900
Mister, are you all right?

198
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,236
You all right?

199
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:13,752
Come on!

200
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:55,085
Goddamn!

201
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,950
Okay, time-out.
Stop the bike.

202
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:39,661
Time-out.
Come on, stop the bike.

203
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:55,427
Holy shit.
Now, don't take this the wrong way.

204
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:57,930
- You are a Terminator, right?
- Yes.

205
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,807
Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.

206
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:14,363
Holy shit.

207
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,408
You're really real.

208
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:20,452
I mean...

209
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:25,958
You're like a machine underneath,
right?

210
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,501
But alive outside?

211
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,503
I'm a cybernetic organism.

212
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,256
Living tissue
over metal endoskeleton.

213
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:49,314
This is intense.

214
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:52,150
Get a grip, John. Okay.

215
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,863
You're not here to kill me.

216
00:35:56,947 --> 00:36:00,909
I figured that part out for myself.
So what's the deal?

217
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:06,415
- My mission is to protect you.
- Yeah? Who sent you?

218
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:08,792
You did.

219
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,044
Thirty-five years from now,
you reprogrammed me...

220
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:13,839
to be your protector here,
in this time.

221
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:16,758
Oh, this is deep.

222
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,763
So this other guy,
he's a Terminator like you, right?

223
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:25,559
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.

224
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,979
More advanced than you are?

225
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:33,567
- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.
- What the hell does that mean?

226
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:37,904
- Liquid metal.
- Where are we going?

227
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:41,325
We have to get out of the city
immediately and avoid the authorities.

228
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:44,119
I gotta stop by my house.
I wanna pick up some stuff.

229
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:48,999
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely
try to reacquire you there.

230
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,835
- You sure?
- I would.

231
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:05,098
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

232
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,852
but I gotta warn 'em.

233
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,313
Shit. You got a quarter?

234
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:23,075
- Hello.
<i>- Janelle, it's me.</i>

235
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:25,535
- John?
<i>- Is everything all right?</i>

236
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:28,038
- Are you guys okay?
<i>- Sure, honey, everything's okay.</i>

237
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:31,208
- Are you all right?
<i>- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

238
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:34,878
John, it's late.
I was beginning to worry about you.

239
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,673
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

240
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,299
I'm making beef stew.

241
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:42,302
Somethings wrong.
She's never this nice.

242
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:44,179
Where are you?

243
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,140
What the hell is
the goddamn dog barking at?

244
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:50,477
Hey, shut up,
you worthless piece of shit!

245
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,020
The dog's really barking.

246
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:54,314
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that mutt.

247
00:37:58,235 --> 00:38:00,987
John, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

248
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:02,781
Could he already be there?

249
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,200
Are you okay?

250
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:09,287
- I'm right here. I'm fine.
<i>- Are you sure you're all right?</i>

251
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:12,708
- What's the dog's name?
- Max.

252
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:15,127
Hey, Janelle.
What's wrong with Wolfie?

253
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,796
I can hear him barking.
Is he okay?

254
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:21,758
Wolfie's fine, honey.
Wolfie's just fine.

255
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:23,510
Where are you?

256
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:26,179
Your foster parents are dead.

257
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,052
I need a minute here.

258
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:10,474
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

259
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:13,477
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

260
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,978
Get real.

261
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:18,815
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

262
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:20,817
No, only an object
of equal size.

263
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:23,278
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

264
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:25,614
It can't form complex machines.

265
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,283
Guns and explosives
have chemicals, moving parts.

266
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,745
It doesn't work that way.
But it can form solid metal shapes.

267
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:34,581
- Like what?
- Knives and stabbing weapons.

268
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:37,334
These were taken by
a video surveillance camera...

269
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:41,296
at the West Highland Police Station
in 1984.

270
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:44,758
He killed 17 police officers
that night.

271
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,137
Men with families...

272
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,140
children.

273
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:56,144
These were taken at a mall
in Reseda...

274
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:58,438
today.

275
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:02,817
Miss Connor, we know you know
who this guy is.

276
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:09,991
I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing...

277
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:12,911
that the foster parents
have been murdered.

278
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,746
We know this guy's involved.

279
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:19,125
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

280
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:27,676
We're wasting our time.
Let's go.

281
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,303
Sorry, guys.

282
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:34,683
She's grown more disconnected
from reality as time goes on.

283
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,977
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

284
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,272
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

285
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:41,982
Sure.

286
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:45,026
Douglas, take her back to her room.

287
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,278
Yes, sir.

288
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:49,948
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

289
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,075
You see...

290
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,370
we spent a lot of time in Nicaragua
and places like that.

291
00:40:56,621 --> 00:41:00,959
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy...

292
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:02,419
running guns.

293
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:05,422
Then there were some other guys.

294
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:07,507
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from...

295
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:10,844
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

296
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,598
Then she gets busted.

297
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:18,310
It's like, "Sorry, kid, your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?"

298
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,441
Like everything I've been brought up
to believe is all made-up bullshit.

299
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:26,359
I hated her for that.

300
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,074
But everything she said was true.

301
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:36,328
She knew...

302
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,582
and nobody believed her...

303
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:44,252
not even me.

304
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,089
Listen. We gotta get her
out of there.

305
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:51,551
Negative. The T-1000's highest
probability for success now...

306
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:54,679
will be to copy Sarah Connor and wait
for you to make contact with her.

307
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:56,848
Great. What happens to her?

308
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,809
Typically, the subject being copied
is terminated.

309
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:03,146
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

310
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,315
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.

311
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:07,567
Fuck you!
She's a priority to me!

312
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:13,406
Goddamn it!
What's your problem? Help!

313
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,283
This does not help our mission.

314
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:17,827
Get this psycho off of me!
Help!

315
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:20,955
I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

316
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,082
Let me go!

317
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:28,421
Why did you do that?

318
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:30,423
Because you told me to.

319
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,678
What?

320
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,685
You have to do what I say?

321
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:43,978
That's one of my mission parameters.

322
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:48,400
Prove it.
Stand on one foot.

323
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,320
Yes!

324
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:58,118
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

325
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:00,870
You okay, kid?

326
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:02,330
Take a hike, bozo.

327
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:04,999
Let's get outta here, man.

328
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,960
Fuck you, you little dipshit!

329
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,170
Dipshit?

330
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,466
Put your leg down.

331
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:18,388
- Did you call <i>moi</i> a dipshit?
- Just trying to help this punk.

332
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,807
Grab this guy.

333
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:23,601
Get him off of me!

334
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:25,770
Now who's the dipshit...

335
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:27,647
you jock douche bag?

336
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,200
Put the gun down now!

337
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:42,495
- Get outta here!
- Come on. Let's split!

338
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:51,379
You were gonna kill that guy!

339
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:53,631
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

340
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:58,470
Listen to me very carefully, okay?

341
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:01,890
You're not a Terminator anymore,
all right?

342
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,392
You got that?

343
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:06,728
You just can't go around
killing people.

344
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:07,854
Why?

345
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,982
What do you mean, why?
'Cause you can't.

346
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,861
Because you just can't.
Trust me on this.

347
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:24,370
Look. I'm gonna go get my mom.

348
00:44:24,454 --> 00:44:27,290
I order you to help me.

349
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:57,273
You have a Sarah Connor here?

350
00:46:57,357 --> 00:46:59,025
You're runnin' kind of late.

351
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:01,486
They've been in there for an hour.

352
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,988
Hold on a second.
I'll buzz you in.

353
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:09,702
Oh, here come your friends now.

354
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:14,851
- Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

355
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:17,979
- How 'bout a beer?
- Yeah, right.

356
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:45,089
- Hey, I got a full house.
- That's good, Louis.

357
00:48:45,173 --> 00:48:47,425
Must be my lucky day.

358
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:12,737
You're right about number 24.

359
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,823
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

360
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:18,784
- Same kind?
- Mm-hmm.

361
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,927
You!

362
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,348
You broke my arm.

363
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:43,226
There are 215 bones
in the human body.

364
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:45,895
That's one. Now, don't move.

365
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:53,569
What are you going to do?

366
00:51:57,073 --> 00:51:59,158
Why do we stop now?

367
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:04,247
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

368
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,916
- Right.
- Swear?

369
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:08,501
What?

370
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:11,671
Just put up your hand and say,
"I swear I won't kill anyone."

371
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:15,591
I swear I will not kill anyone.

372
00:52:15,675 --> 00:52:16,842
All right. Let's go.

373
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,851
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00...

374
00:52:25,935 --> 00:52:28,187
Monday through Friday.

375
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:33,109
What are you doing?

376
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,820
You son of a bitch!
You shot me!

377
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:38,906
Crazy bastard!

378
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:45,496
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.

379
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:51,002
He'll live.

380
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:07,601
Son of a bitch!

381
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:10,396
Let's try to remain calm.

382
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:12,398
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

383
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:14,525
There's no way, Connor.
Let him go.

384
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,153
- Open the door.
- It ain't gonna happen.

385
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:19,071
Take it easy, Sarah.

386
00:53:19,155 --> 00:53:22,283
It won't work. You're no killer.
I don't believe you can do it.

387
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:25,328
You're already dead. Everybody dies.
You know I believe it.

388
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:27,455
So don't fuck with me!

389
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:29,248
Open the door!

390
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:37,715
Back off!

391
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:39,216
Get back!

392
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,260
I'll pump him full of this shit.
I swear!

393
00:53:42,595 --> 00:53:44,638
Don't move!

394
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:46,974
Drop the shit!

395
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:48,934
Do it!

396
00:53:49,018 --> 00:53:50,936
Get in the office.

397
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,064
On the floor, face down.
Not you!

398
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:54,815
Open the door.

399
00:53:57,693 --> 00:54:01,113
On the floor. Hold it open.
Face the wall!

400
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:18,964
Get her!

401
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:49,662
Hurry up! Open the door!
The door's locked!

402
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:52,623
Let's go! Open it!

403
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:57,044
- She broke it off.
- Open it!

404
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:04,802
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it!

405
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,043
Mom, wait!

406
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:45,885
Come back here!

407
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:52,141
- Help her!
- Wait here.

408
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:54,810
- Hurry up!
- He'll kill us all!

409
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:57,354
Hold her.

410
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:00,065
He'll kill us all!

411
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:24,590
Mom, are you okay? Mom!

412
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:31,472
Come with me
if you want to live.

413
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:34,099
It's okay, Mom.
He's here to help.

414
00:56:58,791 --> 00:56:59,833
Go.

415
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:34,702
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

416
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:51,343
Get down.

417
00:58:27,296 --> 00:58:28,839
Out of the car!

418
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,383
Right now!

419
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:56,909
Go!

420
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:09,380
I'm out.

421
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:18,097
- Come on.
- Here.

422
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:22,726
Reload.

423
00:59:31,652 --> 00:59:33,612
Last one!

424
00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:42,413
Hang on.

425
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,149
Ready!

426
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:25,789
Here, drive.

427
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:21,220
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

428
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:23,388
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

429
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:26,892
Can you see anything?

430
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:29,394
I see everything.

431
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:33,899
Cool.

432
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:39,363
Come here.

433
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,912
I said I was okay.

434
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,874
John, it was stupid of you
to go there.

435
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:54,086
You have to be smarter
than that.

436
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:55,754
You were almost killed.

437
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:58,757
What were you thinking?

438
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:02,177
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me.

439
01:02:02,261 --> 01:02:05,472
Do you understand?
You're too important.

440
01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:08,225
Do you understand?

441
01:02:11,103 --> 01:02:12,229
But...

442
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:17,609
I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.

443
01:02:18,861 --> 01:02:21,238
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.

444
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:30,080
What's wrong with your eyes?

445
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,458
Nothing.

446
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:45,846
So, what's your story?

447
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:57,482
You okay?

448
01:02:57,566 --> 01:02:58,984
Fine.

449
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:04,156
Say, that's a nice bike.

450
01:03:26,637 --> 01:03:28,347
Watch it, lug nuts.

451
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:39,274
Listen, do you know
what you're doing?

452
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:42,152
I have detailed files
on human anatomy.

453
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:45,030
I bet.

454
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:48,116
Makes you a more efficient killer,
right?

455
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,326
Correct.

456
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:57,417
Does it hurt
when you get shot?

457
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:01,922
I sense injuries.
The data could be called "pain."

458
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,176
John, help me with the light.

459
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:08,553
- Will these heal up?
- Yes.

460
01:04:08,637 --> 01:04:12,849
Good. If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.

461
01:04:12,933 --> 01:04:15,519
How long do you live?
I mean, last. Whatever.

462
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:19,022
A hundred and twenty years
with my existing power cell.

463
01:04:19,106 --> 01:04:22,025
Can you learn stuff that you
haven't been programmed with...

464
01:04:22,109 --> 01:04:23,527
so you can be...

465
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:27,489
you know, more human...

466
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:30,283
and not such a dork
all the time?

467
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:35,122
My CPU is a neural net processor,
a learning computer.

468
01:04:35,706 --> 01:04:39,543
The more contact I have with humans,
the more I learn.

469
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:41,378
Cool.

470
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:14,703
Are we learning yet?

471
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:30,093
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

472
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:35,432
Just head south.

473
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,776
Keep it under 65.

474
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:48,862
- We don't want to be pulled over.
- Affirmative.

475
01:05:52,074 --> 01:05:54,576
You gotta listen to the way
people talk.

476
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:58,163
You don't say "affirmative"
or some shit like that.

477
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:00,582
You say, <i>"No problemo."</i>

478
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:04,586
If someone comes off to you
with an attitude, you say, "Eat me."

479
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:08,965
And if you want to shine them on,
it's <i>"Hasta la vista, baby."</i>

480
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:14,304
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."

481
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:17,432
If someone gets upset,
you say, "Chill out."

482
01:06:17,516 --> 01:06:18,892
Or you can do combinations.

483
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:21,978
Chill out, dick-wad.

484
01:06:22,813 --> 01:06:24,815
That's great.
See? You're getting it.

485
01:06:41,248 --> 01:06:43,166
Want some of my fries?

486
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:56,012
- Need any help?
- No.

487
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,182
- I got you!
- No, you didn't!

488
01:07:07,566 --> 01:07:10,527
We're not gonna make it, are we?

489
01:07:12,571 --> 01:07:13,780
People, I mean.

490
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,785
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

491
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:22,789
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

492
01:07:22,873 --> 01:07:26,126
Break it up before I wring
both of your necks.

493
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:31,006
I need to know
how Skynet gets built.

494
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:32,340
Who's responsible?

495
01:07:32,424 --> 01:07:35,969
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

496
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,762
Who is that?

497
01:07:37,846 --> 01:07:41,766
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

498
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:46,313
Why him?

499
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:49,774
In a few months, he creates
a revolutionary type of microprocessor.

500
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:52,152
Go on. Then what?

501
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:56,197
In three years Cyberdyne will become
the largest supplier...

502
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:57,657
of military computer systems.

503
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:01,661
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers...

504
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:03,204
becoming fully unmanned.

505
01:08:03,288 --> 01:08:06,333
Afterwards they fly with
a perfect operational record.

506
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:09,044
The Skynet funding bill is passed.

507
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:12,422
The system goes on-line
on August 4, 1997.

508
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:15,675
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defense.

509
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:18,470
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

510
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:22,849
It becomes self-aware
at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29.

511
01:08:23,934 --> 01:08:26,519
In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.

512
01:08:27,646 --> 01:08:29,898
- Skynet fights back.
- Yes.

513
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:32,734
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

514
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:35,862
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

515
01:08:35,946 --> 01:08:40,325
Skynet knows the Russian counterattack
will eliminate its enemies over here.

516
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:42,494
Jesus.

517
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:46,498
How much do you know
about Dyson?

518
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:50,710
I have detailed files.

519
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,880
I want to know everything.

520
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:59,094
What he looks like,
where he lives, everything.

521
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,124
Wait in the car.

522
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:09,164
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

523
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:31,686
Hey, big John.

524
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:33,438
What's up?

525
01:10:34,773 --> 01:10:37,025
He's cool, Enrique.
He's with me.

526
01:10:37,108 --> 01:10:40,278
He's... Uncle Bob.

527
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:42,572
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

528
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:44,407
Uncle Bob, huh?

529
01:10:45,492 --> 01:10:46,743
Okay.

530
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:54,793
Drink?

531
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:01,549
"Uncle Bob"?

532
01:11:03,551 --> 01:11:06,346
You're pretty famous,
all over the goddamn TV.

533
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:09,099
Pictures of you, John,
your big friend here.

534
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:11,142
Cops are going nuts
looking for you.

535
01:11:15,063 --> 01:11:19,025
I just came for my stuff.
I need clothes, food and a truck.

536
01:11:19,109 --> 01:11:21,152
How about the fillings in my teeth?

537
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:23,404
Now, Enrique.

538
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:26,950
You two,
you're on weapons detail.

539
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:28,701
Let's go.

540
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,224
One thing about my mom...

541
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:55,478
she always plans ahead.

542
01:12:06,156 --> 01:12:07,365
Excellent.

543
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:21,713
This is my best truck,
but the starter motor's gone.

544
01:12:21,796 --> 01:12:23,715
You got time to change it out?

545
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:27,176
Yeah. I'm gonna wait till dark
to cross the border.

546
01:12:29,304 --> 01:12:31,764
See, I grew up in places like this...

547
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:34,142
so I just thought
that's how people lived...

548
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:36,436
riding around in helicopters...

549
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:38,605
learning how to blow shit up.

550
01:12:43,151 --> 01:12:45,278
That's definitely you.

551
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:59,417
Most of the guys my mom
hung around with were geeks...

552
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:03,212
but there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.

553
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:05,214
He taught me engines.

554
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:07,467
Hold here.

555
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,969
Mom screwed it up, of course.

556
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:12,472
She'd always tell 'em
about Judgment Day...

557
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:15,350
and me being this world leader.

558
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:17,393
That'd be all she wrote.

559
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:19,854
Torque wrench, please.

560
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:26,611
I wish I could've met
my real dad.

561
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:28,446
You will.

562
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,698
Yeah, I guess.

563
01:13:30,782 --> 01:13:34,619
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

564
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:38,414
They sent him back through time
to 1984.

565
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:39,916
Man.

566
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:43,920
He hasn't even been born yet.

567
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:47,632
It messes with your head.

568
01:13:50,385 --> 01:13:53,304
- The other bolt.
- Oh. Here.

569
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:03,189
Mom and him were only together
for one night.

570
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:05,733
She still loves him, I guess.

571
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:08,695
I see her crying sometimes.

572
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:12,782
She denies it totally, of course,
like she got something stuck in her eye.

573
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:19,288
Why do you cry?

574
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:21,874
- You mean people?
- Yeah.

575
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:23,334
I don't know.

576
01:14:23,418 --> 01:14:25,503
We just cry...

577
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:28,131
you know, when it hurts.

578
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:35,972
Pain causes it?

579
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:39,183
No. It's different.

580
01:14:39,267 --> 01:14:42,562
It's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyway.

581
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:44,230
- You get it?
- No.

582
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,191
All right, my man!

583
01:14:49,027 --> 01:14:50,653
Give me five.

584
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:54,824
Just put out your hand
like this.

585
01:14:56,159 --> 01:15:00,496
All right! Now hit me.
Give me five. Do the same thing.

586
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:07,670
Okay, that's good.
Up high.

587
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,922
Five low.

588
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:11,674
Too slow.

589
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:16,929
I'm just kidding.
One more time.

590
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:19,223
Good. Now try it.

591
01:15:19,307 --> 01:15:21,267
Now do me.
Give me five.

592
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:27,273
<i>Watching John with the machine,
it was suddenly so clear.</i>

593
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:30,276
<i>The Terminator would never stop.</i>

594
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:34,322
<i>It would never leave him,
never hurt him...</i>

595
01:15:34,405 --> 01:15:37,825
<i>never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him...</i>

596
01:15:37,909 --> 01:15:40,495
<i>or be too busy
to spend time with him.</i>

597
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,456
<i>It would always be there...</i>

598
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:46,209
<i>and it would die
to protect him.</i>

599
01:15:47,627 --> 01:15:50,963
<i>Of all the would-be fathers
who came and went over the years...</i>

600
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:53,091
<i>this thing, this machine...</i>

601
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:55,551
<i>was the only one
who measured up.</i>

602
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:58,137
<i>In an insane world...</i>

603
01:15:58,221 --> 01:16:00,181
<i>it was the sanest choice.</i>

604
01:17:37,945 --> 01:17:39,906
Hey, let's try this one.

605
01:17:45,536 --> 01:17:47,705
There we go.

606
01:19:33,811 --> 01:19:36,314
She said go south with him
like you planned.

607
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:38,607
- She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom!

608
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:41,569
Mom, wait!

609
01:19:56,834 --> 01:19:58,294
"No fate."

610
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:01,964
No fate but what we make.

611
01:20:04,091 --> 01:20:06,093
My father told her this.

612
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:12,933
I made him memorize it in the future
as a message to her.

613
01:20:14,602 --> 01:20:16,520
Never mind.

614
01:20:16,604 --> 01:20:19,940
Okay, the whole thing goes...

615
01:20:20,024 --> 01:20:22,735
The future's not set.

616
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:26,322
There's no fate but what
we make for ourselves.

617
01:20:26,405 --> 01:20:29,408
She intends to change the future.

618
01:20:29,492 --> 01:20:30,951
Yeah, I guess.

619
01:20:32,495 --> 01:20:34,330
Oh, shit!

620
01:20:34,413 --> 01:20:36,332
- Dyson.
- Yeah.

621
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:39,919
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

622
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:42,004
She's gonna blow him away.

623
01:20:42,088 --> 01:20:44,173
Come on! Let's go!

624
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,604
This is tactically dangerous.

625
01:20:58,687 --> 01:20:59,814
Drive faster.

626
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:02,400
The T-1000 has the same files
that I do.

627
01:21:02,483 --> 01:21:05,903
It knows what I know.
It might anticipate this move.

628
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:08,489
I don't care.
We gotta stop her.

629
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:10,491
Killing Dyson
might prevent the war.

630
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:14,078
I don't care!
Haven't you learned anything yet?

631
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:17,248
Haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?

632
01:21:23,421 --> 01:21:26,048
Danny, I told you to go to bed.
I'm not kidding.

633
01:21:26,132 --> 01:21:28,467
Just a couple of minutes, Mom!

634
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:39,728
Danny, your time is up!

635
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:42,898
Come brush your teeth
and get to bed.

636
01:22:24,732 --> 01:22:26,066
Daddy!

637
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:28,652
Danny, go! Go!

638
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:39,038
- Tarissa, run!
- Oh, my God!

639
01:22:46,128 --> 01:22:48,172
Just take Danny and run!

640
01:22:48,255 --> 01:22:49,506
Run!

641
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:51,342
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

642
01:23:10,236 --> 01:23:11,237
Daddy!

643
01:23:12,947 --> 01:23:14,406
Nobody fucking move!

644
01:23:15,241 --> 01:23:16,492
Don't hurt my daddy!

645
01:23:16,575 --> 01:23:18,118
On the floor, bitch.

646
01:23:18,202 --> 01:23:20,371
Get down now!

647
01:23:21,247 --> 01:23:22,331
Get out of the way!

648
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:23,874
Don't hurt him!

649
01:23:25,376 --> 01:23:27,378
Get on the floor now!

650
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:32,132
Just let the boy go.

651
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:33,801
Shut up. Shut up.

652
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:35,177
Shut up!

653
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:37,846
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

654
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:40,182
- It's all your fault!
- What?

655
01:23:40,266 --> 01:23:42,393
I'm not gonna let you do it.

656
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:36,488
Shit! We're too late!

657
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:42,119
Check them.

658
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:47,791
Look at me, Mom.

659
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:50,085
Are you hurt?

660
01:24:53,714 --> 01:24:55,799
I almost...

661
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:09,772
It'll be okay.

662
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:11,815
We'll figure something out.
Okay?

663
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,027
I promise.

664
01:25:18,322 --> 01:25:21,283
You came here to stop me.

665
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:24,119
Yeah, I did.

666
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:28,999
I love you, John.

667
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:32,252
I always have.

668
01:25:34,171 --> 01:25:35,589
I know.

669
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:44,807
Deep penetration.

670
01:25:46,392 --> 01:25:48,310
No shattered bone.

671
01:25:48,394 --> 01:25:51,355
Hold here.
The pressure should stop the bleeding.

672
01:26:02,116 --> 01:26:03,534
Who are you people?

673
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:05,911
Show him.

674
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:12,751
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Show me your room.

675
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:54,460
Oh, my God.

676
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:57,212
Now listen to me
very carefully.

677
01:27:03,093 --> 01:27:07,222
<i>Dyson listened while the Terminator
laid it all down.</i>

678
01:27:07,306 --> 01:27:11,185
<i>Skynet. Judgment Day.</i>

679
01:27:11,268 --> 01:27:13,562
<i>The history of things to come.</i>

680
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:17,733
<i>It's not every day that
you find out you're responsible...</i>

681
01:27:17,816 --> 01:27:20,652
<i>for three billion deaths.</i>

682
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:22,654
<i>He took it pretty well.</i>

683
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:27,117
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

684
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:35,250
You're judging me...

685
01:27:35,334 --> 01:27:37,794
on things I haven't even done yet.

686
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:44,134
How were we supposed to know?

687
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:48,555
Yeah.

688
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:51,016
Right.

689
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:53,227
How were you supposed to know?

690
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:57,981
Fucking men like you
built the hydrogen bomb.

691
01:27:58,065 --> 01:28:00,651
Men like you...

692
01:28:00,734 --> 01:28:02,152
thought it up.

693
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:07,991
You think you're so creative.

694
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:12,496
You don't know what it's like
to really create something...

695
01:28:12,579 --> 01:28:14,706
to create a life...

696
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:16,333
to feel it growing inside you.

697
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:19,336
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

698
01:28:19,419 --> 01:28:21,088
Mom!

699
01:28:21,171 --> 01:28:24,925
We need to be a little more
constructive here. Okay?

700
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:27,094
We still have to stop this
from happening, don't we?

701
01:28:27,177 --> 01:28:30,013
But I thought...

702
01:28:30,097 --> 01:28:34,101
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

703
01:28:34,184 --> 01:28:38,981
That's right. There's no way I'm going
to finish the new processor. Not now.

704
01:28:39,064 --> 01:28:42,526
Forget it. I'm out of it.
I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.

705
01:28:42,609 --> 01:28:44,486
That's not good enough.

706
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:46,488
No one must follow your work.

707
01:28:46,572 --> 01:28:48,448
Right.

708
01:28:48,532 --> 01:28:52,869
All right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab...

709
01:28:52,953 --> 01:28:54,538
the files, the disk drives...

710
01:28:54,621 --> 01:28:57,249
everything here.

711
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:59,418
Everything.

712
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:01,420
I don't care.

713
01:29:02,713 --> 01:29:03,714
The chip.

714
01:29:03,797 --> 01:29:05,882
- Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

715
01:29:05,966 --> 01:29:08,385
It's at Cyberdyne.
It's from the other one like you.

716
01:29:08,468 --> 01:29:11,179
The CPU from the first Terminator.

717
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:13,640
Son of a bitch!
I knew it!

718
01:29:13,724 --> 01:29:16,435
They told us not to ask
where they got it.

719
01:29:16,518 --> 01:29:18,854
Those lying motherfuckers.

720
01:29:18,937 --> 01:29:20,731
It's scary stuff.
Radically advanced.

721
01:29:20,814 --> 01:29:21,940
It was smashed.

722
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:25,652
It didn't work, but it gave us ideas,
took us in new directions.

723
01:29:25,736 --> 01:29:27,738
Things we would've never...

724
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:31,992
All my work was based on it.

725
01:29:32,075 --> 01:29:33,910
It must be destroyed.

726
01:29:36,163 --> 01:29:39,166
Can you get us in?
Past security?

727
01:29:39,249 --> 01:29:41,335
I think so, yeah. When?

728
01:29:46,256 --> 01:29:47,257
Now?

729
01:29:51,178 --> 01:29:54,222
<i>The future,
always so clear to me...</i>

730
01:29:54,306 --> 01:29:57,309
<i>had become like
a black highway at night.</i>

731
01:29:57,392 --> 01:30:00,103
<i>We were in
uncharted territory now...</i>

732
01:30:00,187 --> 01:30:03,106
<i>making up history
as we went along.</i>

733
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:43,355
Carl, right?

734
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:48,110
Friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd...

735
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:50,195
take 'em upstairs
and show 'em around.

736
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:53,573
Mr. Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

737
01:30:53,657 --> 01:30:55,826
I need written authorization...

738
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:58,870
I insist.

739
01:30:58,954 --> 01:31:00,706
Don't even think about it.

740
01:31:11,675 --> 01:31:13,135
It's okay.

741
01:31:14,553 --> 01:31:17,681
It takes two keys, turned
simultaneously, to open the vault.

742
01:31:17,764 --> 01:31:20,684
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

743
01:31:22,018 --> 01:31:23,478
Gibbons?

744
01:31:26,523 --> 01:31:28,358
Gibbons! Come on, man!

745
01:31:28,442 --> 01:31:31,528
You can't leave the desk
like that!

746
01:31:36,366 --> 01:31:37,868
Oh, shit.

747
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:57,429
My card should access this.

748
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:04,519
- What is it?
- Damn it.

749
01:32:04,603 --> 01:32:06,563
The silent alarm's been tripped.

750
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:15,489
It's neutralized all the codes
in the entire building.

751
01:32:15,572 --> 01:32:17,491
Nothing will open anywhere now.

752
01:32:18,575 --> 01:32:20,410
We have to abort.

753
01:32:23,622 --> 01:32:27,042
We go all the way.
Okay?

754
01:32:29,169 --> 01:32:32,964
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

755
01:32:33,048 --> 01:32:35,509
- I think it's that guy from the mall.
- It is.

756
01:32:35,592 --> 01:32:37,511
It's him and the woman.

757
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:42,265
Just send everything
you got in the area right now.

758
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:47,938
I have a personal entry code
for the lab. It may still work.

759
01:32:52,442 --> 01:32:53,485
It's no good.

760
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:55,111
Let me try mine.

761
01:33:00,075 --> 01:33:02,160
John, fire in the hole!

762
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:19,010
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the Halon system.

763
01:33:26,184 --> 01:33:28,645
You have to wait
until the gas clears.

764
01:33:31,147 --> 01:33:32,440
Put this on.

765
01:33:46,413 --> 01:33:48,915
All right, let's get to work.

766
01:34:10,145 --> 01:34:13,440
<i>All units in the vicinity
and all units able to respond...</i>

767
01:34:13,523 --> 01:34:18,320
<i>a 211 in progress, 2144 Kramer Street,
the Cyberdyne building.</i>

768
01:34:18,403 --> 01:34:20,071
<i>Suspect one is white female...</i>

769
01:34:20,155 --> 01:34:23,617
<i>identified as last name Connor,
first name Sarah.</i>

770
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:26,620
<i>Escaped last night
from Pescadero State Hospital.</i>

771
01:34:26,703 --> 01:34:28,580
<i>Suspect two: White male...</i>

772
01:34:28,872 --> 01:34:33,376
<i>fitting description of the individual wanted
for the murder of police officers in 1984.</i>

773
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:35,754
<i>Suspects are armed and
considered extreme...</i>

774
01:35:28,014 --> 01:35:29,808
All right.

775
01:35:29,891 --> 01:35:31,685
7-2-5-6.

776
01:35:38,525 --> 01:35:39,859
Easy money.

777
01:35:48,952 --> 01:35:51,371
Oh, shit. Not good.

778
01:35:56,459 --> 01:35:58,086
How we doing?

779
01:35:58,169 --> 01:35:59,838
Primer cord is set.

780
01:35:59,921 --> 01:36:02,382
One more barrel,
two more minutes.

781
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:09,180
- How do we set them off?
- Remote control.

782
01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:11,641
Piece of cake.

783
01:36:11,725 --> 01:36:13,268
- We got company.
- Police?

784
01:36:13,351 --> 01:36:16,688
- How many?
- All of 'em, I think.

785
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:18,189
Go. I'll finish here.

786
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:21,568
Come on.

787
01:36:22,652 --> 01:36:24,571
I'll take care of the police.

788
01:36:24,654 --> 01:36:25,947
Wait! You swore!

789
01:36:28,908 --> 01:36:30,368
Trust me.

790
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:45,258
<i>You at the window!</i>

791
01:36:45,341 --> 01:36:48,803
<i>Drop your weapon and place
your hands on top of your head!</i>

792
01:36:50,138 --> 01:36:51,973
Holy shit!

793
01:36:52,057 --> 01:36:53,600
That's a mini-gun!

794
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:18,166
- Come on!
- Oh, shit!

795
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:19,793
Go! Go! Go!

796
01:38:07,382 --> 01:38:08,842
Fire!

797
01:38:26,192 --> 01:38:27,819
Same time, to the left.

798
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:30,238
One, two, three, go.

799
01:38:42,375 --> 01:38:45,211
In order to get that out...

800
01:38:52,010 --> 01:38:54,762
We got Skynet by the balls now.

801
01:38:54,846 --> 01:38:56,556
Come on, let's book.

802
01:38:57,473 --> 01:38:59,392
Hold your fire!

803
01:39:24,584 --> 01:39:27,086
- Ready to rock?
- Ready.

804
01:39:29,839 --> 01:39:31,132
Time to go.

805
01:39:31,216 --> 01:39:32,675
Now.

806
01:39:32,759 --> 01:39:36,304
- Take this. They'll use gas.
- Come on.

807
01:39:36,387 --> 01:39:39,474
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

808
01:40:03,748 --> 01:40:06,501
Mom! Mom!

809
01:40:50,878 --> 01:40:52,005
Shit!

810
01:40:53,423 --> 01:40:56,342
She's in the clean room.
There's no way outta there.

811
01:41:05,852 --> 01:41:06,853
Get down!

812
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:15,778
Here.

813
01:41:41,304 --> 01:41:44,724
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

814
01:41:48,895 --> 01:41:50,396
Fall back!

815
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:52,065
Everybody out!

816
01:41:52,148 --> 01:41:54,067
Fall back now!
Go! Go! Go!

817
01:42:29,477 --> 01:42:31,437
<i>We got a war zone here!</i>

818
01:43:03,344 --> 01:43:05,054
Shut your eyes.

819
01:43:11,644 --> 01:43:14,814
Stay here. I'll be back.

820
01:43:22,655 --> 01:43:24,991
Get down on the floor!
Face down!

821
01:43:27,702 --> 01:43:29,287
On the floor now!

822
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:33,124
Okay, drop him!

823
01:44:52,995 --> 01:44:54,413
Here, hold this.

824
01:45:27,822 --> 01:45:28,823
Go!

825
01:46:07,778 --> 01:46:08,696
Shit!

826
01:46:22,293 --> 01:46:24,003
Get out.

827
01:46:43,022 --> 01:46:44,315
Listen.

828
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:47,109
No matter what happens,
stay under these vests.

829
01:46:47,193 --> 01:46:48,444
- You got it?
- Yeah.

830
01:46:48,527 --> 01:46:49,987
All right.

831
01:47:04,543 --> 01:47:05,795
Chopper's coming in!

832
01:47:05,878 --> 01:47:07,004
It's him.

833
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:06,105
Shit!

834
01:48:08,983 --> 01:48:10,776
Stay down!

835
01:49:25,059 --> 01:49:27,520
Goddamn! You all right?

836
01:49:35,027 --> 01:49:37,446
Come on, Mom,
we gotta get out.

837
01:49:39,365 --> 01:49:40,991
Take the shotgun.

838
01:49:44,245 --> 01:49:45,830
Are you hurt?

839
01:49:59,009 --> 01:50:01,929
Holy shit.
Come on, Mom. Come on!

840
01:50:02,012 --> 01:50:04,723
- We need your truck.
- Hurry!

841
01:50:09,728 --> 01:50:12,231
- Come on. Hurry.
- Get in.

842
01:50:15,234 --> 01:50:16,443
Go!

843
01:50:22,449 --> 01:50:24,451
What the hell...

844
01:50:30,332 --> 01:50:33,085
- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

845
01:50:34,753 --> 01:50:36,422
Here. This'll work.

846
01:50:42,011 --> 01:50:43,721
He's gaining.

847
01:50:46,265 --> 01:50:47,933
Step on it!

848
01:50:48,017 --> 01:50:50,811
- This is the vehicle's top speed.
- I can run faster than this!

849
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:03,115
Coming up, to the right.

850
01:51:05,159 --> 01:51:07,119
Watch it! Watch it!

851
01:51:29,683 --> 01:51:31,810
- Drive.
- Where are you going?

852
01:51:39,276 --> 01:51:41,195
Take the off-ramp.

853
01:51:50,871 --> 01:51:52,039
Shit!

854
01:51:55,209 --> 01:51:56,293
Hold on!

855
01:52:42,131 --> 01:52:43,757
Don't stop!

856
01:52:51,598 --> 01:52:53,017
Go straight!

857
01:52:55,644 --> 01:52:57,938
- Look out!
- Duck!

858
01:53:12,077 --> 01:53:14,038
Get the hell outta here!

859
01:53:19,543 --> 01:53:22,588
Get outta here!
Let's go! Come on!

860
01:54:39,581 --> 01:54:42,042
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

861
01:55:31,633 --> 01:55:33,051
We don't have much time.

862
01:55:55,657 --> 01:55:56,909
Let's go.

863
01:55:57,993 --> 01:55:59,786
We gotta get outta here.

864
01:55:59,870 --> 01:56:01,955
Come on! Get up!

865
01:56:15,552 --> 01:56:17,262
Hand me the shotgun.

866
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:24,394
Put your weight on me, Mom.

867
01:56:25,187 --> 01:56:27,105
Hurry!

868
01:56:30,651 --> 01:56:32,277
Come on, Mom.

869
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:40,118
Get up!

870
01:56:56,259 --> 01:56:58,095
This way. Come on.

871
01:57:07,145 --> 01:57:09,147
No! Wait!

872
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:13,360
Wait. No. No.
It's too hot. Go back.

873
01:57:21,576 --> 01:57:23,829
- Go. Run.
- No! We gotta stick together.

874
01:57:23,912 --> 01:57:25,914
John, you've got to go now.

875
01:57:25,998 --> 01:57:28,166
- John!
- Go! Now!

876
01:58:42,616 --> 01:58:44,409
Get up the steps.

877
01:58:51,792 --> 01:58:53,293
Get up.

878
01:58:54,086 --> 01:58:56,254
Come on, Mom.
I got you.

879
01:59:30,664 --> 01:59:32,999
Grab the chain. Grab it.

880
01:59:34,376 --> 01:59:37,129
Grab it. Go. Go!

881
01:59:47,472 --> 01:59:50,809
Mom, come on! Mom!

882
02:00:39,941 --> 02:00:41,735
Call to John.

883
02:00:44,529 --> 02:00:46,406
I know this hurts.

884
02:00:48,200 --> 02:00:49,868
Call John.

885
02:01:06,259 --> 02:01:08,929
Call to John now.

886
02:01:10,931 --> 02:01:12,807
Fuck you.

887
02:04:30,380 --> 02:04:31,798
Help!

888
02:04:52,485 --> 02:04:54,070
Mom.

889
02:04:55,655 --> 02:04:57,574
- Help me.
- Get out of the way, John.

890
02:05:00,326 --> 02:05:02,704
- John! John!
- Shoot!

891
02:05:57,467 --> 02:05:59,886
Get down!

892
02:07:33,187 --> 02:07:35,356
Get up. Come on.

893
02:07:37,608 --> 02:07:39,402
Holy shit.

894
02:07:39,485 --> 02:07:41,946
I need a vacation.

895
02:07:55,168 --> 02:07:57,962
Is it dead?

896
02:07:58,046 --> 02:07:59,464
Terminated.

897
02:08:02,967 --> 02:08:04,635
Will this melt in there?

898
02:08:07,597 --> 02:08:09,474
Yes. Throw it in.

899
02:08:16,564 --> 02:08:18,483
And the chip.

900
02:08:33,664 --> 02:08:35,291
It's over.

901
02:08:42,131 --> 02:08:43,800
There's one more chip.

902
02:08:48,471 --> 02:08:50,723
And it must be destroyed also.

903
02:08:56,187 --> 02:08:57,772
Here.

904
02:08:57,855 --> 02:09:01,234
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

905
02:09:14,372 --> 02:09:16,833
I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.

906
02:09:16,916 --> 02:09:19,210
No, it'll be okay.
Stay with us.

907
02:09:19,293 --> 02:09:21,295
- It'll be okay.
- I have to go away.

908
02:09:21,379 --> 02:09:23,965
No, don't do it.
Please, don't go.

909
02:09:24,048 --> 02:09:27,135
I must go away, John.

910
02:09:27,218 --> 02:09:28,678
No, wait.

911
02:09:28,761 --> 02:09:31,681
- You don't have to do this.
- I'm sorry.

912
02:09:32,598 --> 02:09:34,851
No, don't do it! Don't go!

913
02:09:34,934 --> 02:09:36,894
It has to end here.

914
02:09:38,104 --> 02:09:41,399
I order you not to go!

915
02:09:49,365 --> 02:09:51,409
I know now why you cry.

916
02:09:53,786 --> 02:09:56,247
But it's something
I can never do.

917
02:10:30,573 --> 02:10:32,783
Good-bye.

918
02:12:11,882 --> 02:12:14,927
<i>The unknown future
rolls toward us.</i>

919
02:12:15,011 --> 02:12:18,931
<i>I face it for the first time
with a sense of hope.</i>

920
02:12:19,015 --> 02:12:21,392
<i>Because if a machine,
a Terminator...</i>

921
02:12:21,475 --> 02:12:24,854
<i>can learn the value
of human life...</i>

922
02:12:24,937 --> 02:12:27,356
<i>maybe we can too.</i>
