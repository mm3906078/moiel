This next patient is interesting.

68
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,590
I've been following
the case for years.

69
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,793
A 29-year-old female,

70
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,761
diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

71
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,012
The usual indicators:
Depression, anxiety,

72
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,766
violent acting out,
delusions of persecution.

73
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,563
The delusional architecture
is fairly unique.

74
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:59,615
She believes that a machine
called the Terminator,

75
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,033
which looked human, of course,

76
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,828
was sent back through time
to kill her.

77
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,154
That's original.

78
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,082
And also,
that the father of her child

79
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,126
was a soldier
sent back to protect her.

80
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,625
- No?
- He was from the future too.

81
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:18,631
The year 2029,
if I remember correctly.

82
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,712
And here we are.

83
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:22,593
Morning, Sarah.

84
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,897
Good morning, Dr Silberman.
How's the knee?

85
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,684
Fine, Sarah.

86
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:41,070
She, er... stabbed me in the kneecap
with my pen a few weeks ago.

87
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,242
Repeated escape attempts...

88
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,672

Lewis.

90
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,514
I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.

91
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,804
- See she takes her Thorazine.
- Sure. I'll take care of it.

92
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,435
Time to take you meds, Connor.

93
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,987
You take it.

94
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,359
You gotta be good.
You're up for review this afternoon.

95
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,360
I'm not taking it.

96
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,822
- I don't want any trouble.
- Ain't no trouble...

97
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,203
Yeah, zap her.

98
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,553
Last call, sugar.

99
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,190
Sweet dreams.

100
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,506
Are you the legal guardian
of John Connor?

101
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,676
That's right, Officer.
What's he done now?

102
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,229
- Could I speak with him, please?
- You could if he were here.

103
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,148
He took off on his bike this morning
so he could be anywhere.

104
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:41,853
- Do you have a photograph of John?
- Yeah. Hold on.

105
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,158
You gonna tell me what this is about?

106
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,235
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

107
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,700
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?

108
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,161
No, go on. There was a guy here
this morning looking for him, too.

109
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,087
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.

110
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,211
Has that got something
to do with this?

111
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,471
No. I wouldn't worry about him.

112
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,391
Thanks for your cooperation.

113
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,137
Please insert
your stolen card now.

114

This is taking too long.

116
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,818

117
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,870
All right!

118
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,574

119
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,205
From my mom.
My real mom, I mean.

120

121
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,425
Come on, baby. Come on! Come on!

122
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,720
- Yes!
- Hey, it worked.

123
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,469
All right. Easy money. Come on!

124
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,094
Yes! Piece of cake.

125
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,482
- Is that her?
- Yes.

126
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:09,736
- She's pretty cool, huh?
- No, she's a complete psycho.

127
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,570
That's why she's at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute, OK?

128
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,322
She tried to blow up
a computer factory,

129
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,827
but she got shot and arrested.

130
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,500
No shit.

131
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,624
She's a total loser.

132
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,422
Come on.
Let's go spend some money.

136
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,291
You're dead.

137
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,381
Where's our son, Sarah?

138
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,555
They took him away from me.

139
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,009
- He's the target now.
- I know!

140
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,094
He's alone.
You have to protect him.

141
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,599
I know.

142
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,561
You tell me how I am supposed
to do that.

143
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,976
He doesn't even
believe me anymore.

144
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,319
I've lost him.

145
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,272
You're strong, Sarah.

146
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,824
- Stronger than you ever thought.
- No.

147
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,619
On your feet, soldier!

148
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,248
I love you. I always will.

149
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,712
- I need you.
- I'll always be with you.

150
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,840
Remember the message?

151
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,013

153

Stay with me.

154

There's not much time left
in the world, Sarah.

155
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,552
Kyle, don't go!

156
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,017
Kyle!

157
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:04,926
It's like a giant strobe light,

158
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,511
burning right to my eyes.

159
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,151
Somehow I can still see.

160
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,874
We know
the dream's the same every night.

161
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,415
- Why do I have to...
- Please continue.

162
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,835
Children look like burnt paper.

163
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,054
Black.

164
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,632
Not moving.

165
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,394
And then the blast wave hits them.

166
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,777
And they fly apart like leaves.

167
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:07,910
Dreams of cataclysm,
the end of the world are very common.

168
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:14,003
It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.

169
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:17,958
- I know the date it happens.
- I'm sure it feels very real to you.

170
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:23,262
On August 29 1997, it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin' real to you, too!

171
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,924
Anybody not wearing
two-million sunblock

172
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,635
is gonna have
a real bad day. Get it?

173
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,854
God! You think you're safe and alive.

174
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,228
You're already dead. Everybody!

175
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,855
Him. You. You're dead already.

176
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,813
This whole place,
everything you see is gone!

177
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,991
You're the one
living in a fucking dream, Silberman!

178
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:44,987
Cos I know it happened!

179
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,785
It happened!

180
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,003
I feel much better now.

181
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,960
Clearer.

182
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:08,516
Yes, your attitude has been
much improved lately.

183
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:20,069
It's helped me to have a goal,

184
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,322
something to look forward to.

185
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,569
What is that?

186
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:30,914
Well, you said that if I showed
improvement after six months,

187
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,662
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing

188
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,961
and I could have visitors.

189
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,545
Well, it's been six months and...

190
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,587
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

191
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,297
I see.

192
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:56,564
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

193
00:25:56,764 --> 00:26:00,018
Now you think they don't exist?

194
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,444
They don't exist.

195
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,237
I know that now.

196
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,236
But you've told me
on many occasions

197
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,785
about how you crushed one
in a hydraulic press.

198
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:14,157
If I had, there would have been
some evidence.

199
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,662
They would have found something
at the factory.

200
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,869
I see.

201
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:22,924
So, you don't believe any more
that the company covered it up?

202
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,553
No. Why would they?

203
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,715
Let's try a new position right there.

204
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:35,099
The neuronal sensors are correct,
because it works.

205
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,805
- Right.
- Those neurons are all centred.

206
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,682
Maybe
the inhibitor circuits failed...

207
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:41,983
Mr Dyson?

208
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,859
Mr Dyson, the materials team
is running another...

209
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,569
- Mr Dyson.
- Yes?

210
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,618
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

211
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,663
You have to sign for the...
Er... it.

212
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,787
- You have to sign it out.
- OK. Come on. I'll get it.

213
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:00,623
Mr Dyson,

214
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:02,847
I know I haven't been here long, but
I was wondering if you could tell me,

215
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,044
- I mean, if you know...
- Know what?

216
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,798
Well, if you know
where "it" came from.

217
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:11,301
I asked them that very same question
once. You know what they told me?

218
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:12,677
"Don't ask."

219
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,482
- Good morning, Mr Dyson.
- How's it going?

220
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,771
Insert key.

221
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,946
Left on three, two, one, turn.

222
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,618
- How are the wife and kids?
- Great. Thanks.

223
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:33,990
There you go.

224
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,274
So,
what do you think, Doctor?

225
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,102
I have shown improvement, haven't I?

226
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:11,527
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

227
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,068
I know how smart you are.

228
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,818
I think you're just telling me
what I want to hear.

229
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,624
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

230
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:22,626
I think if I put you
in minimum security,

231
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,828
you'll just try to escape again.

232
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,511
You have to let me see my son.

233
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:34,964
Please.

234
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,762
Please.

235
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:42,931
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

236
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,890
If I could just make a phone call...

237
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,022
Afraid not. Not for a while.

238
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,239
I don't see any choice
but to recommend to the review board

239
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,737
that you stay here
for another six months.

240
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,822
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

241
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,661
- Get her off of me!
- You son of a bitch!

242
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,122
10cc of sodium amobarbital, stat!

243
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,551
- You don't know what you're doing!
- Get some restraints in here now!

244
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,798
You don't know what you're doing!

245
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,267
Model citizen.

246
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,229
You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

247
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,023
He said he was going to the galleria?

248
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,270
Yeah.

249
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,101
The galleria?

250
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,525
I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right?

251
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,209
- Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?

252
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,919
No.

253
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,968
- Hey, do you know this guy?
- Nah, I don't know him.

254
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,149
- John.
- Not now.

255
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,194
Hey, there's this cop
scoping for you. Check it out.

256
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,571
- He's right over there.
- Split, man.

257
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,698
- Just go.
- Yeah.

258
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:49,950
I saw that kid...

259
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,284
Hey!

260
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,350
Hey! You're not supposed
to be in here!

261
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,074
Hey!

262
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,248
Get down.

263
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,196
Mister, are you all right?

264
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,090
Come on!

265
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,677
Goddamn!

266
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,627
Agh!

267
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:29,201
OK. Time out. Stop the bike.

268
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,332
Time out. Come on, stop the bike.

269
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,768
Holy shit.
Now, don't take this the wrong way.

270
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,017
- But you are a Terminator, right?
- Yes.

271
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:54,067
- Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
- No?

272
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:08,873
Holy shit! You're really real.

273
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:12,752
I mean...

274
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:19,793
You're like a machine underneath,
right? But sort of alive outside?

275
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,799
I'm a cybernetic organism:

276
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,552
Living tissue
over metal endoskeleton.

277
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,485
This is intense.

278
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,408
Get a grip, John. OK.

279
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,072
You're not here to kill me.

280
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,205
I figured that part out for myself.
So what's the deal?

281
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:56,003
My mission is to protect you.

282
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,707
Yeah? Who sent you?

283
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,000
You did.

284
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,552
35 years from now,

285
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:06,131
you reprogrammed me to be
your protector here, in this time.

286
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:09,092
Oh, this is deep.

287
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:34,542
This other guy,
he's a terminator like you, right?

288
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:38,212
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.

289
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:44,340
- More advanced than you are?
- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.

290
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,676
- What the hell does that mean?
- Liquid metal.

291
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:50,550
Where are we going?

292
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,510
We have to get out of the city
immediately

293
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:53,971
and avoid the authorities.

294
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,436
Listen, I got to stop by my house.
I want to pick up some stuff.

295
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,611
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely
try to reacquire you there.

296
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:04,485
- You sure?
- I would.

297
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,835
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

298
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,506
...but I gotta warn them.

299
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:24,050
Shit! You got a quarter?

300
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:35,763
- Hello.
- 'Janelle, it's me.'

301
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,189
- John?
- 'Yeah. Is everything all right?'

302
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,687
- Are you guys OK?
- 'Sure, honey, everything's OK.'

303
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,896
- Are you all right?
- 'Yeah, I'm fine.'

304
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:47,573
John, it's late.
I was beginning to worry about you.

305
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:50,323
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

306
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,948
I'm making beef stew.

307
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,247
Something's wrong.
She's never this nice.

308
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:56,825
John, where are you?

309
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:59,786
What the hell is the goddamn dog
barking at?

310
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:03,123
Hey, shut up,
you worthless piece of shit!

311
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,674
The dog's really barking.

312
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:07,234
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that fucking mutt.

313
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,633
John, honey, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

314
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:17,846
- Could he already be there?
- Honey, are you OK?

315
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,227
I'm right here. I'm fine.

316
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,933
'Are you sure you're all right?'

317
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,940
- What's the dog's name?
- Max.

318
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,780
Janelle, what's wrong
with Wolfie?

319
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,449
I can hear him barking. Is he OK?

320
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,324
Wolfie's fine, honey.
Wolfie's just fine.

321
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:36,156
Where are you?

322
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,826
Your foster parents are dead.

323
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,823
No, no. I need a minute here.

324
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:23,207
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

325
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:25,755
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

326
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,753
Get real.

327
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:31,587
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

328
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,467
No, only an object of equal size.

329
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,094
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

330
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:40,019
It can't form complex machines.
Guns, explosives have chemicals,

331
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,347
moving parts.
It doesn't work that way.

332
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:45,016
- But it can form solid metal shapes.
- Like what?

333
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,234
Knives and stabbing weapons.

334
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:20,302
These were taken
by a video surveillance camera

335
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:23,559
at the West Highland police station
in 1984.

336
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:28,355
He killed
17 police officers that night.

337
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,105
Men with families...

338
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,074
...children.

339
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,913
These were taken at a mall
in Reseda today.

340
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:46,206
Miss Connor,
we know you know who this guy is.

341
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:52,672
Look, I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing.

342
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,752
That the foster parents
have been murdered.

343
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:57,214
We know this guy's involved.

344
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:02,268
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

345
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:12,772
- We're wasting our time. Let's go.
- Sorry, guys.

346
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:15,482
She's grown more and more
disconnected from reality

347
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,192
as time goes on.

348
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,073
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

349
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:22,952
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

350
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,498
Sure.

351
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,452
Douglas,
take her back to her room, please.

352
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,752
Yes, sir.

353
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,461
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

354
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:37,637
You see, we spent a lot of time
in Nicaragua and places like that.

355
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:43,385
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy

356
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:44,802
running guns.

357
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:47,855
Then there were some other guys.

358
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,935
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from

359
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:53,236
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

360
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:57,027
Then she gets busted.

361
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:00,735
It's like, "Sorry, kid. Your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?"

362
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,070
It's like everything
I'd been brought up to believe

363
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,949
was all made-up bullshit.

364
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,581
I hated her for that.

365
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,541
But everything she said was true.

366
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,794
She knew.

367
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:23,049
And nobody believed her.

368
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,727
Not even me.

369
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,515
Listen,
we gotta get her out of there.

370
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:34,068
Negative. The T-1000's
highest probability for success now

371
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,485
will be to copy Sarah Connor

372
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,326
and wait for you
to make contact with her.

373
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,364
Great. What happens to her?

374
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,318
Typically, the subject
being copied is terminated.

375
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,496
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

376
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,824
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.

377
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:50,034
Fuck you! She's a priority to me!

378
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:54,755
Goddamn it!
What's your problem? Damn it!

379
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:57,799
- Help! Help!
- This does not help our mission.

380
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,344
Get this psycho off of me! Help!

381
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,468
Help! I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

382
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:04,672
Let me go!

383
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:12,891
- Why the hell did you do that?
- Because you told me to.

384
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,399
What?

385
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:24,201
You have to do what I say, huh?

386
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,496
That's one of my mission parameters.

387
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,284
Prove it. Stand on one foot.

388
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:34,837
Yes!

389
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,634
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

390
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:44,847
- You OK, kid?
- Take a hike, bozo.

391
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:49,473
- Let's get outta here, man.
- Fuck you, you little dipshit!

392
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,895
Dipshit?

393
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,933
Put your leg down.

394
00:48:56,142 --> 00:49:00,818
- Did you call <i>mói</i> a dipshit?
- Just trying to help this punk.

395
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:03,274
Grab this guy.
I can't believe he called me...

396
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:06,110
Agh! God! Get him off of me!

397
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:09,367
Now who's the dipshit,
you jock douche bag?

398
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:10,789
Get off me!

399
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:18,122
No!

400
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,671
Put the gun down, now!

401
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:25,050
- Get outta here!
- Come on. Let's split!

402
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,895
Jesus! You were gonna kill that guy!

403
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,098
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

404
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:40,983
Listen to me very carefully, OK?

405
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:44,407
You're not a Terminator anymore,
all right?

406
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:46,701
You got that?

407
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:49,245
You just can't go around
killing people.

408
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,445
Why?

409
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,453
What do you mean, why?
Cos you can't.

410
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,657
Why?

411
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,374
Because you just can't.
Trust me on this.

412
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,887
Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.

413
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:10,512
And I order you to help me.

414
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:18,451
Hm!

415
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,283
Hi!

416
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:41,538
- You have a Sarah Connor here?
- You're running late, aren't you?

417
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:43,995
They've been in there for an hour.

418
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:46,547
Hold on a second. I'll buzz you in.

419
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,043
Oh, here come your friends now.

420
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,652
Well, that was productive.

421
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:57,110
- Hey, Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

422
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:58,861
How 'bout a beer?

423
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,491
Yeah, right!

424
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:28,023
- Hey, I got a full house.
- That's good, Lewis.

425
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,146
Must be my lucky day.

426
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,204
I think you're right
about number 24.

427
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:58,131
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

428
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:00,551
- Same time?
- Mm-hmm.

429
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,729
You!

430
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:22,861
You broke my arm.

431
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:25,659
There are 215 bones
in the human body.

432
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,408
That's one. Now, don't move.

433
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,082
What are you gonna do?

434
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,754
Why do we stop now?

435
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:46,806
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

436
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,474
- Right.
- Swear?

437
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:51,052
What?

438
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,263
Just put up your hand and say,
"I swear I won't kill anyone."

439
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:59,310
- I swear I will not kill anyone.
- All right. Let's go.

440
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:10,238
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00,
Monday through Friday.

441
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:18,288
- What the hell are you doing?
- You son of a bitch! You shot me!

442
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:21,423
You crazy bastard!

443
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:27,964
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.

444
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,260
He'll live.

445
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:50,110
Son of a bitch!

446
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,909
Let's try to remain calm.

447
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:55,091
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

448
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:57,038
There's no way, Connor. Let him go.

449
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,370
- Open the door.
- It ain't gonna happen.

450
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:01,421
Take it easy, Sarah. Easy.

451
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:03,248
It won't work, Sarah.
You're no killer.

452
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:04,800
I don't believe you can do it.

453
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,252
You're already dead, Silberman.

454
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,940
Everybody dies.
You know I believe it.

455
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:11,716
- So don't fuck with me!
- Open the door. Open the door.

456
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:20,232
Back off!

457
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:21,729
Get back!

458
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,731
I'll pump him full of this shit.
I swear!

459
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:27,151
Don't move!

460
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:31,452
- Drop the shit!
- Do it! Do it!

461
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:34,325
Get in the office.
On the floor, face down.

462
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:35,621
Not you!

463
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,324
Open the door.

464
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:42,580
On the floor. Hold it open.
Face the wall!

465
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:01,307
Get her! Get her!

466
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:29,088
Sarah!

467
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:32,136
- Hurry up! Open the door!
- The door's locked!

468
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,098
Let's go! Open it!

469
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,298
Get the other door!

470
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,560
- She broke it off.
- Open it!

471
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,273
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it!

472
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:13,966
No!

473
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:15,514
No!

474
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:20,561
- No!
- Mom, wait!

475
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,057
Mom!

476
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:31,234
- Come back here!
- No! No!

477
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:32,947
No!

478
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:34,650
- Help her!
- Wait here.

479
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:36,360
Hurry UP!

480
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:38,536
He'll kill us all! He'll kill us all!

481
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:39,829
Hold her.

482
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,078
He'll kill us all!

483
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,974
Mom, are you OK? Mom!

484
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,984
Come with me, if you want to live.

485
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:16,408
It's OK, Mom. He's here to help.
It's OK.

486
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:42,342
Go.

487
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:17,211
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

488
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:33,485
Get down.

489
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,794
No! Mom!

490
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:11,306
Out of the car!

491
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:13,896
Right now!

492
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,381
Go!

493
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:51,851
I'm out.

494
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:00,564
- Come on.
- Here.

495
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:05,197
Reload.

496
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:16,128
Last one!

497
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,880
Hang on.

498
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:52,491
Ready!

499
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,422
John!

500
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:08,131
Here, drive.

501
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,811
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

502
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,193
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

503
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:11,741
- Can you even see anything?
- I see everything.

504
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:16,374
Cool.

505
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:21,666
Come here.

506
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:29,421
I said I was OK.

507
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:33,350
John,
it was stupid of you to go there.

508
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:36,595
God damnit! You have to be
smarter than that.

509
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:38,271
You almost got yourself killed.

510
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:41,232
What were you thinking?

511
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:44,770
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me.

512
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:46,321
Do you understand?

513
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:50,697
You're too important.
Do you understand?

514
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:54,696
But...

515
01:07:56,531 --> 01:08:00,126
I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.

516
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:03,713
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.

517
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:12,547
What's wrong with your eyes?

518
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:16,059
Nothing.

519
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,358
So, what's your story?

520
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:39,995
You OK?

521
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,621
Fine.

522
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:46,631
Say, that's a nice bike.

523
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:10,773
Hey! Watch it, lug nuts.

524
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:21,583
Listen,
do you know what you're doing?

525
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:24,627
I have detailed files
on human anatomy.

526
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:30,550
I bet! Makes you
a more efficient killer, right?

527
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:31,797
Correct.

528
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:39,805
Does it hurt when you get shot?

529
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,688
I sense injuries. The data
could be called pain.

530
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:48,977
John, help me with the light.

531
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:51,195
- Will these heal up?
- Yes.

532
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:54,862
Good. If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.

533
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:58,570
How long do you live,
I mean "last", whatever?

534
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:01,490
120 years with
my existing power cell.

535
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:04,458
Can you learn stuff you
haven't been programmed with?

536
01:10:04,826 --> 01:10:09,627
So you can be...
you know, more human?

537
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:12,049
Not such a dork all the time?

538
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:19,383
My CPU is a neural-net processor,
a learning computer,

539
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:22,636
hat Skynet presets to READ
only when we are sent out alone.

540
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:27,432
Doesn't want you
to do too much thinking.

541
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:29,021
No.

542
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:32,528
Can we reset the switch?

543
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:54,592
Rotate the two locking cylinders
counterclockwise.

544
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,090
Do it.

545
01:11:10,892 --> 01:11:12,394
Now open the port cover.

546
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:17,861
Pull to break the seal.

547
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:25,365
Good, now remove
the shock damping assembly.

548
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:31,204
You can now access the CPU.

549
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:34,090
- Do you see it?
- Yes.

550
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:36,834
Pull the CPU by its base tap.

551
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:39,795
Pull.

552
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:18,842
Can you see the pin switch?

553
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:20,670
No!

554
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:24,344
- Out of my way, John!
- Don't kill him!

555
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:28,139
"It", John, not "him".

556
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:31,310
Okay, "it". But we need "it".

557
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:33,732
Listen to me. Listen.

558
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,269
We're better off on our own.

559
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:40,027
He's the only proof of
the future, the war and that.

560
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:42,574
Maybe.

561
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:46,780
I don't trust it.

562
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:48,949
But he's my friend, alright?

563
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:52,418
You don't know what it's like
to kill these things.

564
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:55,751
If something goes wrong,
this could be our last chance.

565
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:58,549
If I'm supposed to
be this military leader,

566
01:12:58,749 --> 01:13:01,798
maybe you start listening
to my ideas once in a while.

567
01:13:05,506 --> 01:13:09,136
'Cause if my own mother won't,
how do you expect anyone else to?

568
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:27,286
Alright, play it your way.

569
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:36,787
Was there a problem?

570
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:38,373
No problem.

571
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:41,299
None whatsoever.

572
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:16,453
Are we learning yet?

573
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:32,435
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

574
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:38,190
Just head south.

575
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:48,200
Keep it under 65.

576
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:51,029
- We don't wanna be pulled over.
- Affirmative.

577
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:56,743
No, no, no. You gotta listen
to the way people talk.

578
01:14:56,951 --> 01:15:00,376
You don't say "affirmative"
or some shit like that.

579
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,752
You say, "No problemo."

580
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:06,757
And if someone comes up to you
with an attitude, you say, "Eat me!"

581
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:11,091
And if you want to shine them on,
it's "Hasta la vista, baby."

582
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:13,718
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

583
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,478
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."

584
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:19,478
And if someone gets upset,
you say, "Chill out."

585
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:24,108
- Or you can do combinations.
- Chill out, dick-wad.

586
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:26,944
That's great. See? You're getting it.

587
01:15:27,148 --> 01:15:29,071
<i>No problemo.</i>

588
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:42,630
- You got any cash?
- I got a couple of hundred bucks.

589
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,172
I'll give you half.

590
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:46,292
Mom!

591
01:15:47,752 --> 01:15:49,049
Get some food.

592
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:53,512
No sense of humor.

593
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:01,186
And that's another thing:

594
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:03,017
Lighten up a bit.

595
01:16:04,018 --> 01:16:08,114
This severe routine is getting old.
You're acting like such a geek.

596
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:09,823
Smile once in a while.

597
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:11,409
Smile?

598
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:14,112
Yeah. You know, smile.

599
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:15,492
Watch.

600
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:20,289
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?

601
01:16:21,202 --> 01:16:22,670
Gimme a break.

602
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,674
Okay. Bad example.

603
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:30,511
See that guy over there?
That's a smile.

604
01:16:50,773 --> 01:16:51,820
That's good.

605
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:55,195
You could practice
in front of a mirror or something.

606
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:03,912
Want some of my fries?

607
01:17:14,672 --> 01:17:15,798
Do you need any help?

608
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:17,507
No.

609
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:19,393
- Got you!
- No, you didn't!

610
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:21,061
- Got you!
- No, you didn't!

611
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:30,108
We're not gonna make it, are we?

612
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:34,025
People, I mean.

613
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:39,029
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

614
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:42,825
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

615
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:45,912
Break it up
before I wring both of your necks.

616
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:52,384
I need to know how Skynet gets built,
who's responsible.

617
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:56,055
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

618
01:17:56,964 --> 01:17:58,090
Who is that?

619
01:17:58,299 --> 01:18:01,428
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

620
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:06,349
Why him?

621
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:08,810
In a few months he creates
a revolutionary type

622
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:10,270
of microprocessor.

623
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:14,274
- Go on. Then what?
- In three years,

624
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:16,449
Cyberdyne will become the largest
supplier

625
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:17,902
of military computer systems.

626
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:21,702
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers,

627
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:23,249
becoming fully unmanned.

628
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:26,578
Afterwards, they fly
with a perfect operational record.

629
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:29,163
The Skynet Funding bill is passed.

630
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:32,671
The system goes on-line
on August 4, 1997.

631
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:35,799
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defence.

632
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:38,722
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

633
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:43,099
It becomes self-aware at 02:14am
Eastern time, August 29.

634
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:46,605
In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.

635
01:18:47,932 --> 01:18:50,151
- Skynet fights back.
- Yes.

636
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:52,854
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

637
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:56,111
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

638
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:58,568
Because Skynet knows
that the Russian counterattack

639
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:00,574
will eliminate its enemies over here.

640
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:02,280
Jesus!

641
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:07,019
How much do you know about Dyson?

642
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:11,335
I have detailed files.

643
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:14,383
Want to know everything.

644
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:19,380
What he looks like.
Where he lives. Everything.

645
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:32,519
Miles!

646
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:57,961
- You going to work all day?
- I'm sorry, baby.

647
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:00,171
This thing is kicking my ass.

648
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:04,384
It's Sunday. You promised to take
the kids to Raging Waters today.

649
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:09,522
I can't. I'm on a roll.

650
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:26,614
This is gonna blow 'em away.
It's a neural-net processor.

651
01:20:26,864 --> 01:20:28,332
I know. You told me.

652
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:31,327
It thinks and learns like we do.

653
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:34,208
It's superconducting
at room temperature.

654
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:38,426
Other computers are just
pocket calculators by comparison.

655
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:42,384
Why is that so important?

656
01:20:42,629 --> 01:20:45,098
I need to know,
'cause sometimes I feel like

657
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:47,677
I'm going crazy here.

658
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:51,142
Baby, I am this close.

659
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:53,228
Come here.

660
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:59,405
Imagine a jet airliner
with a pilot that never gets tired,

661
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:02,820
never makes mistakes,
never shows up with a hangover.

662
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:07,162
Meet the pilot.

663
01:21:07,738 --> 01:21:11,914
Why did we get married?
Have children? You don't need us.

664
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:15,833
Your heart and your mind
are in here.

665
01:21:16,163 --> 01:21:18,336
But it doesn't love you like we do.

666
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:29,180
I'm sorry. Really.

667
01:21:29,927 --> 01:21:33,522
How about spending some time
with your other babies?

668
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:38,276
- Raging Waters?
- Yeah!

669
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:10,134
Wait in the car.

670
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:30,571
Enrique!

671
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:33,123
Are you here?

672
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:50,147
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

673
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:58,104
And you... are always like a snake.

674
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:02,227
It's great
to see you, Connor!

675
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:03,516
I told you I would be back.

676
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:06,406
I knew you would.
It's good to see you.

677
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:07,607
Jolanda!

678
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:10,869
Get out here, we got company.
And bring some tequila.

679
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:14,198
- Hey, big John. <i>Cómo Te Va?</i>
- What's up?

680
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,124
Who's this big guy?

681
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:21,297
He's cool, Enrique.
He's with me. He's, er... Uncle Bob.

682
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:23,340
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

683
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:25,963
Uncle Bob, huh?

684
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:29,046
OK. OK!

685
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:31,691
How are you?

686
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:35,015
How are you?
You've grown so much.

687
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:36,721
Drink?

688
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:42,268
Uncle Bob?

689
01:23:43,352 --> 01:23:47,357
Hey, Sarita! You're pretty
famous, all over the goddamn TV.

690
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:50,113
Pictures of you, John,
your big friend here.

691
01:23:50,317 --> 01:23:53,036
Cops are going nuts
looking for you.

692
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:57,074
I just came for my stuff.

693
01:23:57,282 --> 01:23:59,751
I need clothes,
food and one of your trucks.

694
01:23:59,952 --> 01:24:01,920
How about the fillings
out of my fucking teeth?

695
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,623
Now, Enrique!

696
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:09,466
- You two, you're on weapons detail.
- Come on. Let's go.

697
01:24:30,357 --> 01:24:32,780
One thing about my mom...

698
01:24:34,611 --> 01:24:36,739
...she always plans ahead.

699
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:48,291
Excellent.

700
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:03,019
This is the best truck I got,
but the starter is gone.

701
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:06,067
- You got the time to change it out?
- Yeah.

702
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:08,191
I'm gonna wait till dark
to cross the border.

703
01:25:08,312 --> 01:25:11,316
Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.

704
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:14,235
- You get out tonight too, okay?
- Sure.

705
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:19,115
Just drop by any time
and totally fuck up my life.

706
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:27,456
See, I grew up in places like this,

707
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:30,463
so I thought
that's how people lived:

708
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:34,380
Riding around in helicopters,

709
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:37,015
learning how to blow shit up.

710
01:25:38,842 --> 01:25:43,598
But then, when my mom got busted,
I got put in a regular school.

711
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:47,442
The other kids were into Nintendo.

712
01:26:01,948 --> 01:26:03,746
Are you ever afraid?

713
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:05,289
No.

714
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:10,756
Not even of dying?

715
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:12,925
No.

716
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:21,848
You don't feel any emotion about it
one way or another?

717
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:24,722
No.
I have to stay functional

718
01:26:24,971 --> 01:26:27,019
until the mission is complete.

719
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:33,571
Then it doesn't matter.

720
01:26:34,064 --> 01:26:37,614
Yeah. I have to stay functional too.
I'm "too important".

721
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:55,844
That's definitely you.

722
01:27:08,098 --> 01:27:10,226
Most of the guys my mom
hung round with were geeks.

723
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:14,109
But there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.

724
01:27:14,312 --> 01:27:17,486
- He taught me engines.
- Hold here.

725
01:27:18,442 --> 01:27:20,865
Mom screwed it up, of course.

726
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:23,117
She'd always tell 'em about
Judgment Day

727
01:27:23,321 --> 01:27:25,699
and me being this world leader.

728
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:30,496
- That'd be all she wrote.
- Torque wrench, please.

729
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:34,006
Here.

730
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:39,467
- I wish I could've met my real dad.
- You will.

731
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:44,268
Yeah, I guess.
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

732
01:27:45,552 --> 01:27:48,726
I sent him back through time
to 1984.

733
01:27:49,556 --> 01:27:50,808
Man!

734
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:54,815
He hasn't even been born yet.

735
01:27:56,563 --> 01:27:58,531
It messes with your head.

736
01:28:01,151 --> 01:28:03,779
- The other bolt.
- Oh. Here.

737
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:14,169
Mom and him were only together
for one night.

738
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:19,549
She still loves him, I guess.
I see her crying sometimes.

739
01:28:19,753 --> 01:28:21,175
She denies it totally, of course,

740
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:24,178
like she got something
stuck in her eye.

741
01:28:28,428 --> 01:28:29,930
Why do you cry?

742
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:32,854
- You mean people?
- Yeah.

743
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:35,527
I don't know. We just cry.

744
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:38,822
You know, when it hurts.

745
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:50,117
- Pain causes it?
- Er... no. It's different.

746
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:53,295
It's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyways.

747
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:54,917
- Get it?
- No.

748
01:28:56,289 --> 01:28:57,882
All right, my man!

749
01:28:58,083 --> 01:29:01,303
- No problemo.
- Give me five.

750
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:05,762
Just put out your hand, like this.

751
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:10,854
All right! Now hit me.
Give me five. Do the same thing.

752
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:13,102
All right!

753
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:18,361
OK, that's good. Up high! High five!

754
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:20,605
Five low.

755
01:29:20,814 --> 01:29:22,316
Too slow.

756
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:27,613
I'm just kidding. One more time.

757
01:29:27,821 --> 01:29:29,915
Good. Now try it. Good!

758
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:31,867
Now do me. Give me five.

759
01:29:33,577 --> 01:29:35,579
'Watching John
with the machine,

760
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:37,960
it was suddenly so clear.

761
01:29:38,164 --> 01:29:41,134
'The Terminator would never stop.

762
01:29:41,334 --> 01:29:45,009
'It would never leave him
and it would never hurt him,

763
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:48,638
'never shout at him

764
01:29:48,842 --> 01:29:51,140

to spend time with him.

765

it was the sanest choice.'

769
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:49,495
Come here, darling.

770
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:51,473
Hey, let's try this one.

771
01:31:56,845 --> 01:31:58,392
There we go.

772
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:47,042
She said you go south
with him like you planned.

773
01:33:47,247 --> 01:33:50,251
- She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom!

774
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:52,210
Mom, wait!

775
01:34:07,684 --> 01:34:09,402
"No fate".

776
01:34:10,728 --> 01:34:12,947
"No fate, but what we make."

777
01:34:15,108 --> 01:34:16,735
My father told her this.

778
01:34:19,737 --> 01:34:24,334
I mean, I made him memorise it
in the future as a message to her.

779
01:34:25,577 --> 01:34:30,754
Never mind.
Now, OK, the whole thing goes...

780
01:34:30,957 --> 01:34:33,585
The future's not set.

781
01:34:33,793 --> 01:34:37,218
There's no fate,
but what we make for ourselves.

782
01:34:37,422 --> 01:34:41,928
- She intends to change the future.
- Yeah, I guess.

783
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:45,104
Oh, shit!

784
01:34:45,305 --> 01:34:47,103
- Dyson.
- Yeah.

785
01:34:47,307 --> 01:34:50,686
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

786
01:34:50,894 --> 01:34:52,771
She's gonna blow him away.

787
01:34:52,979 --> 01:34:54,856
Come on! Let's go!

788
01:34:55,064 --> 01:34:56,737
Let's go! Come on!

789
01:35:07,493 --> 01:35:10,497
- This is tactically dangerous.
- Drive faster.

790
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:14,460
The T-1000 has the same files
that I do. It knows what I know.

791
01:35:14,667 --> 01:35:19,173
- It might anticipate this move.
- I don't care. We gotta stop her.

792
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:21,758
Killing Dyson might prevent the war.

793
01:35:21,966 --> 01:35:23,684
I don't care!

794
01:35:23,885 --> 01:35:25,683
Haven't you learned anything yet?

795
01:35:25,887 --> 01:35:28,060
Haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?

796
01:35:30,934 --> 01:35:33,778
Look, maybe you don't care
if you live or die.

797
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:37,069
But everybody's not like that!
We have feelings.

798
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:39,196
We hurt. We're afraid.

799
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:46,033
You gotta learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. It's important.

800
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:26,327
Danny, I told you
to go to bed. I'm not kidding.

801
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:28,533
Just a couple of minutes,
Mom!

802
01:36:45,883 --> 01:36:48,056
Danny, your time is up.

803
01:36:48,219 --> 01:36:50,938
Come brush your teeth
and get to bed.

804
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:20,801
Danny!

805
01:37:22,253 --> 01:37:23,880
Ugh!

806
01:37:32,555 --> 01:37:36,310
- Daddy!
- Danny, just go! Go, Danny! Go!

807
01:37:38,019 --> 01:37:39,066
Miles?

808
01:37:42,815 --> 01:37:44,237
Miles!

809
01:37:44,442 --> 01:37:46,740
- Tarissa, run!
- Oh, my God!

810
01:37:53,951 --> 01:37:55,874
Tarissa, just take Danny and go. Run!

811
01:37:56,079 --> 01:37:57,205
Run!

812
01:37:57,413 --> 01:37:59,040
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

813
01:38:18,393 --> 01:38:20,487
- Daddy!
- Danny! Danny!

814
01:38:20,686 --> 01:38:24,190
- Nobody fucking move!
- Don't hurt my daddy!

815
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:28,074
Get down on the floor, bitch.
Get down now!

816
01:38:28,277 --> 01:38:30,029
Get out of the way.

817
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:31,831
Don't hurt him!

818
01:38:33,533 --> 01:38:35,080
Get on the floor now!

819
01:38:37,370 --> 01:38:39,839
Just let the boy go.

820
01:38:40,039 --> 01:38:42,883
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!

821
01:38:43,084 --> 01:38:45,553
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

822
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:47,881
- It's all your fault!
- What?

823
01:38:48,089 --> 01:38:50,091
I'm not gonna let you do it.

824
01:39:08,734 --> 01:39:09,860
Shhh!

825
01:39:14,115 --> 01:39:15,332
Shhh.

826
01:39:42,185 --> 01:39:44,563
Shit! We're too late!

827
01:39:48,774 --> 01:39:49,775
Check them.

828
01:39:53,488 --> 01:39:56,992
Look at me, Mom. Are you hurt?

829
01:39:57,950 --> 01:39:59,497
Look at me.

830
01:40:01,496 --> 01:40:03,464
I almost...

831
01:40:03,664 --> 01:40:05,587
I almost...

832
01:40:15,384 --> 01:40:19,434
It'll be OK. It's gonna be OK.
We'll figure something out. OK?

833
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:22,733
I promise.

834
01:40:26,604 --> 01:40:31,781
- You came here to stop me.
- Yeah, I did.

835
01:40:34,862 --> 01:40:36,660
I love you, John.

836
01:40:38,574 --> 01:40:40,668
I always have.

837
01:40:42,119 --> 01:40:43,962
I know.

838
01:40:50,419 --> 01:40:52,467
Deep penetration.

839
01:40:54,215 --> 01:40:56,013
No shattered bone.

840
01:40:56,217 --> 01:40:59,016
You hold here. The pressure
should stop the bleeding.

841
01:41:09,939 --> 01:41:13,113
- Who are you people?
- Show him.

842
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:20,454
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Show me your room.

843
01:41:33,504 --> 01:41:36,633
Oh, God! No!

844
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:51,401
Oh, my God!

845
01:42:00,656 --> 01:42:02,158
Oh, my God.

846
01:42:02,366 --> 01:42:04,835
Now, listen to me very carefully.

847
01:42:07,246 --> 01:42:10,625
Nuclear winter effects
caused massive cooling...

848
01:42:10,833 --> 01:42:14,883
'Dyson listened while
the Terminator laid it all down.

849
01:42:15,087 --> 01:42:18,682
'Skynet. Judgment Day.

850
01:42:18,883 --> 01:42:21,932
'The history of things to come.

851
01:42:22,887 --> 01:42:24,605
'It's not every day that you find out

852
01:42:24,805 --> 01:42:28,184
you're responsible
for three billion deaths.

853
01:42:28,392 --> 01:42:30,986
'He took it pretty well.'

854
01:42:32,396 --> 01:42:34,990
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

855
01:42:41,489 --> 01:42:46,086
You're judging me
on things I haven't even done yet.

856
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:52,458
How were we supposed to know?

857
01:42:54,543 --> 01:42:56,170
Yeah!

858
01:42:56,379 --> 01:42:57,881
Right.

859
01:42:58,798 --> 01:43:01,893
How were you supposed to know?

860
01:43:02,093 --> 01:43:05,688
Fucking men like you
built the hydrogen bomb.

861
01:43:05,888 --> 01:43:10,109
Men like you thought it up.

862
01:43:13,896 --> 01:43:16,945
You think you're so creative.

863
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:20,198
You don't know what it's like
to really create something,

864
01:43:20,403 --> 01:43:23,998
to create a life,
to feel it growing inside you.

865
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:26,451
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

866
01:43:26,659 --> 01:43:28,036
Mom!

867
01:43:28,994 --> 01:43:32,624
We need to be a little more
constructive here. OK?

868
01:43:32,832 --> 01:43:34,872
We still have to stop this
from happening, don't we?

869
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,718
But I thought...

870
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:41,766
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

871
01:43:41,966 --> 01:43:45,516
That's right. There's no way
I'm gonna finish the new processor.

872
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:48,394
Not now. Forget it. I'm out of it.

873
01:43:48,597 --> 01:43:52,192
- I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.
- That's not good enough.

874
01:43:52,393 --> 01:43:55,397
- No one must follow your work.
- Right.

875
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:00,326
All right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab:

876
01:44:00,526 --> 01:44:04,952
The files, the disk drives,
everything, everything here.

877
01:44:05,781 --> 01:44:08,625
Everything. I don't care.

878
01:44:10,619 --> 01:44:11,619
The chip.

879
01:44:12,037 --> 01:44:13,677
- Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

880
01:44:13,789 --> 01:44:15,291
They keep it in a vault
at Cyberdyne.

881
01:44:15,499 --> 01:44:16,935
It must be from
the other one like you.

882
01:44:16,959 --> 01:44:21,339
- The CPU from the first Terminator.
- Son of a bitch! I knew it!

883
01:44:21,547 --> 01:44:24,141
They told us
not to ask where they got it.

884
01:44:24,341 --> 01:44:26,560
Those lying motherfuckers.

885
01:44:26,761 --> 01:44:28,434
It's scary stuff. Radically advanced.

886
01:44:28,637 --> 01:44:30,765
I mean,
it was smashed, it didn't work,

887
01:44:30,973 --> 01:44:32,350
but it gave us ideas,

888
01:44:32,558 --> 01:44:35,437
took us in new directions,
things we would've never Th...

889
01:44:37,688 --> 01:44:39,690
All my work was based on it.

890
01:44:39,899 --> 01:44:41,572
It must be destroyed.

891
01:44:43,903 --> 01:44:46,873
Can you get us in? Past security?

892
01:44:47,072 --> 01:44:49,996
I think so, yeah. When?

893
01:44:54,038 --> 01:44:55,038
Now?

894
01:44:59,251 --> 01:45:01,925
'The future,
always so clear to me,

895
01:45:02,129 --> 01:45:05,053
'had become
like a black highway at night.

896
01:45:05,257 --> 01:45:10,809
'We were in uncharted territory now,
making up history as we went along.'

897
01:45:46,257 --> 01:45:50,763
Hi. Er... Carl, right?

898
01:45:52,513 --> 01:45:54,356
Friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd...

899
01:45:54,765 --> 01:45:55,765
Hi!

900
01:45:56,016 --> 01:45:57,893
...take 'em upstairs
and show 'em around.

901
01:45:58,102 --> 01:46:01,276
Mr Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

902
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:03,482
I need written authorisation...

903
01:46:04,692 --> 01:46:08,413
- I insist.
- Don't even think about it.

904
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:20,920
Come on. It's OK.

905
01:46:22,334 --> 01:46:23,774
It takes two keys to open the vault.

906
01:46:23,919 --> 01:46:25,512
They have
to be turned simultaneously.

907
01:46:25,713 --> 01:46:28,387
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

908
01:46:30,009 --> 01:46:31,261
Gibbons?

909
01:46:34,513 --> 01:46:39,189
Gibbons! Come on, man!
You can't leave the desk like that!

910
01:46:41,478 --> 01:46:42,730
Gibbons!

911
01:46:44,231 --> 01:46:45,528
Oh, shit.

912
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:05,548
My card should access this.

913
01:47:09,256 --> 01:47:11,384
- What? What is it?
- Damn it.

914
01:47:12,635 --> 01:47:14,433
The silent alarm's been tripped.

915
01:47:20,559 --> 01:47:23,358
It's neutralised all the codes
in the entire building.

916
01:47:23,562 --> 01:47:27,157
Nothing will open anywhere now.
We have to abort.

917
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:29,822
No.

918
01:47:31,528 --> 01:47:34,702
We go all the way. OK?

919
01:47:36,992 --> 01:47:40,667
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

920
01:47:40,871 --> 01:47:42,311
I think it's that guy from the mall.

921
01:47:42,498 --> 01:47:43,498
It is!

922
01:47:43,624 --> 01:47:45,797
It's him and the woman.

923
01:47:47,127 --> 01:47:49,971
Look, just send everything
you got in the area right now.

924
01:47:52,549 --> 01:47:55,803
I have a personal entry code
for the lab. It may still work.

925
01:48:00,474 --> 01:48:02,647
- It's no good.
- Let me try mine.

926
01:48:07,898 --> 01:48:09,866
John, fire in the hold!

927
01:48:22,037 --> 01:48:26,713
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the halon system.

928
01:48:34,008 --> 01:48:36,352
You have
to wait until the gas clears.

929
01:48:38,971 --> 01:48:40,097
Put this on.

930
01:48:54,361 --> 01:48:56,614
All right, let's get to work.

931
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:21,476
All units in the vicinity,
all units able to respond:

932
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:26,186
A 211 in progress at 2144 Kramer
Street, the Cyberdyne building.

933
01:49:26,518 --> 01:49:28,441
Suspect 1 is white, female,

934
01:49:28,645 --> 01:49:31,649
identified as: Last name Connor,
first name Sarah,

935
01:49:31,857 --> 01:49:34,485
escaped from
Pescadero State Hospital.

936
01:49:34,985 --> 01:49:36,282
Suspect 2: White, male...

937
01:49:40,574 --> 01:49:44,624
All the disks in my office. All the
disks in that office over there.

938
01:49:44,870 --> 01:49:46,838
Everything behind my desk.

939
01:49:47,081 --> 01:49:49,083
All the processors on my left.

940
01:49:49,333 --> 01:49:51,586
We'll blow it up with the CP4.

941
01:50:05,390 --> 01:50:06,767
Could I...

942
01:50:07,267 --> 01:50:08,814
Excuse me...

943
01:50:11,021 --> 01:50:13,149
Could I borrow that thing?

944
01:50:22,491 --> 01:50:24,914
I worked a lot
of years on this thing.

945
01:50:28,956 --> 01:50:33,211
- Give me that location again.
- 2111, Kramer.

946
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:37,090
The suspects are armed and
considered extremely dangerous.

947
01:51:28,307 --> 01:51:29,980
All right!

948
01:51:30,184 --> 01:51:31,811
7-2-5-6.

949
01:51:33,395 --> 01:51:34,395
Yes!

950
01:51:39,109 --> 01:51:40,406
Easy money.

951
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:46,542
Uh-oh.

952
01:51:49,244 --> 01:51:51,542
Oh, shit! Not good.

953
01:51:51,747 --> 01:51:52,919
Not good!

954
01:51:56,752 --> 01:52:00,006
- How we doing?
- Primer cord is set.

955
01:52:00,214 --> 01:52:02,467
One more barrel, two more minutes.

956
01:52:04,509 --> 01:52:09,356
- How do we set them off?
- Remote control.

957
01:52:09,556 --> 01:52:11,809
Piece of cake.

958
01:52:12,017 --> 01:52:13,439
- We got company.
- Police?

959
01:52:13,644 --> 01:52:16,864
- How many?
- All of 'em, I think.

960
01:52:17,064 --> 01:52:18,987
Go. I'll finish here.

961
01:52:20,442 --> 01:52:21,739
Come on.

962
01:52:22,945 --> 01:52:26,119

- Wait! You swore!

963
01:52:29,243 --> 01:52:30,495
Trust me.

'Drop your weapon and place
your hands on top of your head!'

966
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:53,730

967
01:53:16,206 --> 01:53:18,379

We go same time, to the left.

971
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,914
One, two, three, go.

972
01:54:42,834 --> 01:54:45,383
All right, in order to get that out,
you have to...

973
01:54:53,095 --> 01:54:56,725
We got Skynet by the balls now,

974
01:54:58,100 --> 01:54:59,443

Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

Shit!

982
01:56:53,715 --> 01:56:56,594
Shit! She's in the clean room.
There's no way outta there.

983
01:57:06,770 --> 01:57:07,770
Get down!

984
01:57:14,903 --> 01:57:16,155
Here.

985
01:57:41,888 --> 01:57:44,687
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

986
01:57:49,521 --> 01:57:52,240
Fall back! Everybody out!

987
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:54,192
Fall back now! Go! Go! Go!

'We got a war zone
down here!

Shut your eyes.

990
01:59:11,978 --> 01:59:14,982
Stay here. I'll be back.

991
01:59:23,198 --> 01:59:25,121
Get down on the floor, face down!

992
01:59:28,370 --> 01:59:29,417
Down on the floor now!

Aagh!

1002
02:02:43,481 --> 02:02:47,281
Listen. No matter what happens,
you stay under these vests.

1003
02:02:47,485 --> 02:02:48,907
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1004
02:02:49,112 --> 02:02:50,614
All right.

1005
02:03:04,836 --> 02:03:07,134
- Chopper's coming in!
- It's him.

1006

Yeah!

1007

Come on, Mom, we gotta get out.

1012
02:05:39,657 --> 02:05:41,409
- Take the shotgun.
- OK.

1013
02:05:43,536 --> 02:05:44,536
- Agh!

1014
02:05:45,455 --> 02:05:46,672
Are you hurt?

1015
02:05:59,510 --> 02:06:03,310
- Holy shit! Come on, Mom. Come on!
- We need your truck.

1016
02:06:04,015 --> 02:06:05,015
Hurry!

1017
02:06:10,021 --> 02:06:12,865

What the hell...?

1020
02:06:31,084 --> 02:06:33,257
- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

1021

Here. This'll work.

He's gaining.

1023
02:06:46,557 --> 02:06:49,356
- Step on it!
- This is the vehicle's top speed.

1024
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:51,608
I can run faster than this!

1025

- Drive a minute.
- Where the hell are you going?

1028
02:07:39,819 --> 02:07:41,366
Take the off-ramp.

Yes. Throw it in.
