1
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:24,210
<i>Three billion human lives ended
on August 29, 1997.</i>

2
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:26,420
<i>The survivors of the nuclear fire...</i>

3
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:29,215
<i>called the war "Judgment Day."</i>

4
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:32,384
<i>They lived only to face
a new nightmare...</i>

5
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:34,512
<i>the war against the machines.</i>

6
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:56,427
<i>The computer which controlled
the machines, Skynet...</i>

7
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,513
<i>sent two Terminators
back through time.</i>

8
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:03,642
<i>Their mission: to destroy the leader
of the human resistance.</i>

9
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:06,562
<i>John Connor, my son.</i>

10
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:14,862
<i>The first Terminator was programmed
to strike at me in the year 1984...</i>

11
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,281
<i>before John was born.</i>

12
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,200
<i>It failed.</i>

13
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:22,119
<i>The second was set to strike
at John himself...</i>

14
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:24,663
<i>when he was still a child.</i>

15
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:32,087
<i>As before, the resistance was able
to send a lone warrior...</i>

16
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:34,465
<i>a protector for John.</i>

17
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,968
<i>It was just a question of which one
of them would reach him first.</i>

18
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:56,101
I need your clothes, your boots
and your motorcycle.

19
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,070
You forgot to say please.

20
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,130
Get him off me!

21
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,236
Pull it out!

22
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,967
Take it.

23
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,412
Can't let you take
the man's wheels, son.

24
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,999
Now, get off
before I put you down.

25
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,302
That's it, goddamn it.

26
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:56,114
R-31 David, Sherman Code 6...

27
00:10:56,198 --> 00:11:00,911
at the Sixth Street Bridge and Santa Fe
on electrical disturbance.

28
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,246
<i>Ten-four, R-31 David.</i>

29
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:43,096
John, get in there and clean up
that pigsty of yours.

30
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,068
Your foster parents
are kind of dicks, huh?

31
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:00,238
I swear, I have had it
with that goddamn kid.

32
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,949
- He won't even answer me anymore.
- Honey, move.

33
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,952
Would you get off your butt
and help me?

34
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,872
- Todd!
- What?

35
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,292
He hasn't cleaned that room of his
in a month.

36
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,545
Oh, it's an emergency.
Hang on. I'll get right on it.

37
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,471
Come on.

38
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:28,600
Get your ass inside.
Do what your mother tells you.

39
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,562
She's not my mother, Todd.

40
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,757
<i>This next patient is interesting.</i>

41
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,301
I've been following the case
for years.

42
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,470
A 29-year-old female...

43
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:10,475
diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

44
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,812
The usual indicators: depression,
anxiety, violent acting out...

45
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,605
delusions of persecution.

46
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:25,407
<i>The delusional architecture
is fairly unique.</i>

47
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,326
She believes that a machine
called the Terminator...

48
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,746
which looks human,
was sent back through time...

49
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,874
- to kill her.
- That's original.

50
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:37,210
And also that the father
of her child...

51
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:40,547
was a soldier sent back
to protect her.

52
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,549
He was from the future too.

53
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:47,262
The year 2029,
if I remember correctly.

54
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,598
And here we are.

55
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,474
<i>Morning, Sarah.</i>

56
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:59,774
Good morning, Dr. Silberman.
How's the knee?

57
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,528
<i>Fine, Sarah.</i>

58
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,907
She stabbed me in the kneecap...

59
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,535
with my pen a few weeks ago.

60
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,120
Repeated escape attempts.

61
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,633
Let's move on, shall we?

62
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:28,053
I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.

63
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:31,514
- See she takes her Thorazine.
- Sure. I'll take care of it.

64
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:47,322
It's time to take your meds, Connor.

65
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,157
You take it.

66
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,577
Now you know you gotta be good.
You're up for review this afternoon.

67
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:54,579
I'm not taking it, Dougie.

68
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:57,707
- I don't want any trouble.
- Ain't no trouble.

69
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,048
Zap her.

70
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,644
Last call, sugar.

71
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,652
Sweet dreams.

72
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,267
Are you the legal guardian
of John Connor?

73
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:01,020
That's right, Officer.
What's he done now?

74
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:04,065
- Could I speak with him, please?
- You could if he were here.

75
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:07,026
He took off on his bike this morning.
He could be anywhere.

76
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,404
Do you have a photograph of John?

77
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,739
Yeah. Hold on.

78
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,910
Gonna tell me what this is about?

79
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,580
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

80
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:23,543
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?

81
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:27,130
No, go on. There was a guy here
this morning looking for him too.

82
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,382
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.

83
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,926
Has that got something
to do with this?

84
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,349
I wouldn't worry about him.

85
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:41,227
Thanks for your cooperation.

86
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,273
Please insert your stolen card now.

87
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,282
PIN number.

88
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,076
Hurry up. This is taking too long.

89
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,661
Go, baby.

90
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,706
All right.

91
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,502
- PIN number 9003.
- Where'd you learn this stuff from?

92
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,087
From my mom.
My real mom, I mean.

93
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:12,425
Withdraw 300 bucks.

94
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:15,261
Come on, baby. Come on!

95
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,597
- Yes!
- Hey, it worked.

96
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,351
All right. Easy money.
Come on!

97
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,980
Yes! Piece of cake.

98
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:34,364
- Is that her?
- Yes.

99
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,282
She's pretty cool, huh?

100
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,618
No, she's a complete psycho.

101
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,454
That's why she's at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute.

102
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:46,209
She tried to blow up a computer factory
but got shot and arrested.

103
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,378
No shit.

104
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:51,464
She's a total loser.

105
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:54,300
Come on.
Let's go spend some money.

106
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,290
Sarah, wake up.

107
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,090
Kyle.

108
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,136
You're dead.

109
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,263
Where's our son, Sarah?

110
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:43,516
They took him away from me.

111
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,811
- He's the target now.
- I know.

112
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,938
He's all alone.
You have to protect him.

113
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,482
I know.

114
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:54,152
You tell me
how I'm supposed to do that.

115
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:56,362
He doesn't even believe me anymore.

116
00:19:56,446 --> 00:20:00,491
- I've lost him.
- You're strong, Sarah.

117
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:02,994
Stronger than you ever thought
you could be.

118
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,455
On your feet, soldier!

119
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:10,376
I love you, Sarah.
I always will.

120
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,590
- I need you.
- I'll always be with you.

121
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:22,972
Remember the message?

122
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,849
The future is not set.

123
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:29,604
There is no fate
but what we make for ourselves.

124
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,501
Stay with me.

125
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,338
There's not much time left
in the world, Sarah.

126
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:04,639
Kyle, don't go!

127
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:34,270
<i>It's like a giant strobe light...</i>

128
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,689
<i>burning right through my eyes.</i>

129
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,196
<i>Somehow I can still see.</i>

130
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:50,995
<i>Oh, God.</i>

131
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:57,794
<i>We know the dream's the same
every night.</i>

132
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:01,297
<i>- Why do I have to...
- Please continue.</i>

133
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,720
<i>Children look like burnt paper.</i>

134
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:11,474
<i>Black.</i>

135
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,476
<i>Not moving.</i>

136
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,730
<i>And then the blast wave hits them.</i>

137
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,742
<i>And they fly apart like leaves.</i>

138
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:34,872
<i>Dreams of cataclysm,
the end of the world...</i>

139
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:36,874
<i>are very common.</i>

140
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:42,839
<i>It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.</i>

141
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:46,843
<i>- I know the date it happens.
- I'm sure it feels real to you.</i>

142
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,428
<i>On August 29, 1997...</i>

143
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:53,015
<i>it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin' real to you too!</i>

144
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,769
<i>Anybody not wearing two-million
sunblock is gonna have a real bad day.</i>

145
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:58,771
<i>Get it?</i>

146
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:01,732
<i>God, you think
you're safe and alive.</i>

147
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:04,110
<i>You're already dead. Everybody!</i>

148
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,696
<i>Him. You. You're dead already.</i>

149
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,657
<i>This whole place,
everything you see is gone!</i>

150
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,828
<i>You're the one living in the dream,
'cause I know it happens!</i>

151
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,872
<i>It happens!</i>

152
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:29,844
I feel much better now.

153
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,804
Clearer.

154
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:34,682
Yes, your attitude has been...

155
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:37,059
much improved lately.

156
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,905
It's helped me to have a goal...

157
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:52,158
something to look forward to.

158
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,409
What is that?

159
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,828
Well, you said...

160
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:59,749
that if I showed improvement
after six months...

161
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,501
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing...

162
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:05,338
and I could have visitors.

163
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:11,010
Well, it's been six months and...

164
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,430
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

165
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:16,933
I see.

166
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:24,357
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

167
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,903
Now you think they don't exist?

168
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:33,115
They don't exist.
I know that now.

169
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:36,369
But you've told me on many occasions
about how you crushed one...

170
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,537
in a hydraulic press.

171
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:43,042
If I had, there would have
been some evidence.

172
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,544
They would have found something
at the factory.

173
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:47,713
I see.

174
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:51,217
<i>So you don't believe anymore
that the company covered it up?</i>

175
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:56,389
<i>No. Why would they?</i>

176
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:59,725
Let's try a new position
right there.

177
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:11,153
Mr. Dyson?

178
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,658
The materials team
is running another...

179
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,410
- Mr. Dyson.
- Yes?

180
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,454
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

181
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:23,499
You have to sign for the... it.

182
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,419
- You have to sign it out.
- Okay. I'll get it.

183
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,425
I know I haven't been here long,
but I was wondering if you know...

184
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:33,884
Know what?

185
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:36,595
If you know where "it" came from.

186
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:40,099
I asked them the same question once.
You know what they told me?

187
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,143
Don't ask.

188
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:51,110
- Good morning, Mr. Dyson.
- How's it going?

189
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:54,113
Insert key. Left on three.

190
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,532
Two, one, turn.

191
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,872
- How are the wife and kids?
- Great. Thanks.

192
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:33,110
So what do you think, Doctor?

193
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,946
Haven't I shown improvement?

194
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:39,992
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

195
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,496
I know how smart you are.

196
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,623
You're just telling me
what I want to hear.

197
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,710
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

198
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:53,714
If I put you in minimum security,
you'll just try to escape again.

199
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,846
You have to let me see my son.

200
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:03,682
Please.

201
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:10,856
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

202
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,734
If I could make a phone call...

203
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:16,278
I'm afraid not.
Not for a while.

204
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,950
I don't see any choice but to
recommend to the review board...

205
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,619
that you stay here
for another six months.

206
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:30,084
I'll kill you,
you son of a bitch!

207
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:33,796
You son of a bitch!

208
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:38,425
Ten CCs of sodium amobarbital, stat!

209
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:41,428
- You don't know what you're doing!
- Get some restraints in here now!

210
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:46,976
You don't know what you're doing!

211
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:53,107
<i>Model citizen.</i>

212
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:34,857
You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

213
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,110
- He was going to the galleria.
- Yeah.

214
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:39,987
The galleria?

215
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:28,410
I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right?

216
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,136
- Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?

217
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,643
Hey, do you know this guy?

218
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,895
Nah, I don't know him.

219
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:02,611
- John.
- Not now.

220
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:05,948
There's this cop scoping for you.
Check it out.

221
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:10,411
- He's right over there.
- Split, man.

222
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,955
- Just go.
- Yeah.

223
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:18,919
I saw that kid...

224
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:36,186
You're not supposed to
be in here!

225
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,130
Get down.

226
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,078
Mister, are you all right?

227
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:18,414
You all right?

228
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,930
Come on!

229
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,263
Goddamn!

230
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:58,086
Okay, time-out.
Stop the bike.

231
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,756
Time-out.
Come on, stop the bike.

232
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,563
Holy shit.
Now, don't take this the wrong way.

233
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:19,024
- You are a Terminator, right?
- Yes.

234
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:21,943
Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.

235
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,457
Holy shit.

236
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,544
You're really real.

237
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:41,588
I mean...

238
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,052
You're like a machine underneath,
right?

239
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,637
But alive outside?

240
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,639
I'm a cybernetic organism.

241
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,433
Living tissue
over metal endoskeleton.

242
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,408
This is intense.

243
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:13,286
Get a grip, John. Okay.

244
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,999
You're not here to kill me.

245
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:22,045
I figured that part out for myself.
So what's the deal?

246
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:27,551
- My mission is to protect you.
- Yeah? Who sent you?

247
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,887
You did.
Thirty-five years from now...

248
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:34,975
you reprogrammed me to be
your protector here in this time.

249
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:37,811
Oh, this is deep.

250
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,253
So this other guy,
he's a Terminator like you, right?

251
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:07,048
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.

252
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,468
More advanced than you are?

253
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:15,056
- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.
- What the hell does that mean?

254
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:19,394
- Liquid metal.
- Where are we going?

255
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,814
We have to get out of the city
immediately and avoid the authorities.

256
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,609
I gotta stop by my house.
I wanna pick up some stuff.

257
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:30,488
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely
try to reacquire you there.

258
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:33,325
- You sure?
- I would.

259
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,588
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

260
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:50,342
but I gotta warn 'em.

261
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,802
Shit. You got a quarter?

262
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:04,564
- Hello.
<i>- Janelle, it's me.</i>

263
00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:07,025
- John?
<i>- Is everything all right?</i>

264
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,527
- Are you guys okay?
<i>- Sure, honey, everything's okay.</i>

265
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:12,697
- Are you all right?
<i>- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

266
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:16,368
John, it's late.
I was beginning to worry about you.

267
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:19,162
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

268
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,789
I'm making beef stew.

269
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,792
Somethings wrong.
She's never this nice.

270
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,669
Where are you?

271
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,630
What the hell is
the goddamn dog barking at?

272
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:31,966
Hey, shut up,
you worthless piece of shit!

273
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,510
The dog's really barking.

274
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,804
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that mutt.

275
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,477
John, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

276
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,270
Could he already be there?

277
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:46,690
Are you okay?

278
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:50,777
- I'm right here. I'm fine.
<i>- Are you sure you're all right?</i>

279
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:54,197
- What's the dog's name?
- Max.

280
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,616
Hey, Janelle.
What's wrong with Wolfie?

281
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,285
I can hear him barking.
Is he okay?

282
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:03,248
Wolfie's fine, honey.
Wolfie's just fine.

283
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,999
Where are you?

284
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,669
Your foster parents are dead.

285
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,542
I need a minute here.

286
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:51,963
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

287
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,966
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

288
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,468
Get real.

289
00:43:56,551 --> 00:44:00,305
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

290
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,307
No, only an object
of equal size.

291
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,768
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

292
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,061
It can't form complex machines.

293
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:09,189
Guns and explosives
have chemicals, moving parts.

294
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:12,942
It doesn't work that way.
But it can form solid metal shapes.

295
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:16,070
- Like what?
- Knives and stabbing weapons.

296
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,062
These were taken by
a video surveillance camera...

297
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:52,649
at the West Highland Police Station
in 1984.

298
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,110
He killed 17 police officers
that night.

299
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,490
Men with families...

300
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:03,493
children.

301
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,497
These were taken at a mall
in Reseda...

302
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,791
today.

303
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:14,170
Miss Connor, we know you know
who this guy is.

304
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:21,344
I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing...

305
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:24,264
that the foster parents
have been murdered.

306
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,099
We know this guy's involved.

307
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,478
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

308
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:39,028
We're wasting our time.
Let's go.

309
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:41,656
Sorry, guys.

310
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:46,035
She's grown more disconnected
from reality as time goes on.

311
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:48,329
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

312
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:51,624
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

313
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:53,334
Sure.

314
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:56,379
Douglas, take her back to her room.

315
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:57,630
Yes, sir.

316
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,301
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

317
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,428
You see...

318
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:06,723
we spent a lot of time in Nicaragua
and places like that.

319
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:12,312
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy...

320
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:13,771
running guns.

321
00:46:13,855 --> 00:46:16,774
Then there were some other guys.

322
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:18,860
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from...

323
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:22,196
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

324
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:25,950
Then she gets busted.

325
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:29,662
It's like, "Sorry, kid, your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?"

326
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:35,793
Like everything I've been brought up
to believe is all made-up bullshit.

327
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:37,712
I hated her for that.

328
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:44,427
But everything she said was true.

329
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,680
She knew...

330
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,935
and nobody believed her...

331
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:55,605
not even me.

332
00:46:57,565 --> 00:46:59,442
Listen. We gotta get her
out of there.

333
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:02,904
Negative. The T-1000's highest
probability for success now...

334
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:06,032
will be to copy Sarah Connor and wait
for you to make contact with her.

335
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:08,201
Great. What happens to her?

336
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:11,162
Typically, the subject being copied
is terminated.

337
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,499
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

338
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:16,668
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.

339
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,920
Fuck you!
She's a priority to me!

340
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:24,759
Goddamn it!
What's your problem? Help!

341
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,636
This does not help our mission.

342
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,180
Get this psycho off of me!
Help!

343
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:32,308
I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

344
00:47:32,392 --> 00:47:33,434
Let me go!

345
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:39,774
Why did you do that?

346
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,776
Because you told me to.

347
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,030
What?

348
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:53,037
You have to do what I say?

349
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:55,331
That's one of my mission parameters.

350
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:59,752
Prove it.
Stand on one foot.

351
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,673
Yes!

352
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:09,470
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

353
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:12,223
You okay, kid?

354
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,683
Take a hike, bozo.

355
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:16,352
Let's get outta here, man.

356
00:48:16,436 --> 00:48:18,312
Fuck you, you little dipshit!

357
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:20,523
Dipshit?

358
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:24,819
Put your leg down.

359
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:29,741
- Did you call <i>moi</i> a dipshit?
- Just trying to help this punk.

360
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:32,160
Grab this guy.

361
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,954
Get him off of me!

362
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:37,123
Now who's the dipshit...

363
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:39,000
you jock douche bag?

364
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:50,553
Put the gun down now!

365
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:53,848
- Get outta here!
- Come on. Let's split!

366
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:02,732
You were gonna kill that guy!

367
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,984
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

368
00:49:07,195 --> 00:49:09,822
Listen to me very carefully, okay?

369
00:49:09,906 --> 00:49:13,242
You're not a Terminator anymore,
all right?

370
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:15,745
You got that?

371
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:18,081
You just can't go around
killing people.

372
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:19,207
Why?

373
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:22,335
What do you mean, why?
'Cause you can't.

374
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:26,214
Because you just can't.
Trust me on this.

375
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:35,723
Look. I'm gonna go get my mom.

376
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:38,643
I order you to help me.

377
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:08,626
You have a Sarah Connor here?

378
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:10,378
You're runnin' kind of late.

379
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,838
They've been in there for an hour.

380
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:15,341
Hold on a second.
I'll buzz you in.

381
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:21,055
Oh, here come your friends now.

382
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:26,203
- Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

383
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:29,332
- How 'bout a beer?
- Yeah, right.

384
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:56,442
- Hey, I got a full house.
- That's good, Louis.

385
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:58,778
Must be my lucky day.

386
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:24,089
You're right about number 24.

387
00:56:24,173 --> 00:56:27,176
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

388
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:30,137
- Same kind?
- Mm-hmm.

389
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,279
You!

390
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:51,700
You broke my arm.

391
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:54,578
There are 215 bones
in the human body.

392
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:57,248
That's one. Now, don't move.

393
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:04,922
What are you going to do?

394
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,511
Why do we stop now?

395
00:57:11,804 --> 00:57:15,599
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

396
00:57:15,683 --> 00:57:18,269
- Right.
- Swear?

397
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:19,853
What?

398
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:23,023
Just put up your hand and say,
"I swear I won't kill anyone."

399
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:26,944
I swear I will not kill anyone.

400
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:28,195
All right. Let's go.

401
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:37,204
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00...

402
00:57:37,288 --> 00:57:39,540
Monday through Friday.

403
00:57:43,252 --> 00:57:44,461
What are you doing?

404
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:47,172
You son of a bitch!
You shot me!

405
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:50,259
Crazy bastard!

406
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:56,849
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.

407
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,354
He'll live.

408
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,954
Son of a bitch!

409
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:21,749
Let's try to remain calm.

410
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:23,751
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

411
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:25,878
There's no way, Connor.
Let him go.

412
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:28,505
- Open the door.
- It ain't gonna happen.

413
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:30,424
Take it easy, Sarah.

414
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:33,636
It won't work. You're no killer.
I don't believe you can do it.

415
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:36,680
You're already dead. Everybody dies.
You know I believe it.

416
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:38,807
So don't fuck with me!

417
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:40,601
Open the door!

418
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,068
Back off!

419
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:50,569
Get back!

420
00:58:50,653 --> 00:58:52,613
I'll pump him full of this shit.
I swear!

421
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,991
Don't move!

422
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:58,327
Drop the shit!

423
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,287
Do it!

424
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:02,289
Get in the office.

425
00:59:02,373 --> 00:59:04,416
On the floor, face down.
Not you!

426
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,168
Open the door.

427
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:12,466
On the floor. Hold it open.
Face the wall!

428
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:30,317
Get her!

429
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:01,014
Hurry up! Open the door!
The door's locked!

430
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:03,976
Let's go! Open it!

431
01:00:06,437 --> 01:00:08,397
- She broke it off.
- Open it!

432
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:16,155
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it!

433
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:49,396
Mom, wait!

434
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:57,237
Come back here!

435
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:03,494
- Help her!
- Wait here.

436
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:06,163
- Hurry up!
- He'll kill us all!

437
01:01:07,456 --> 01:01:08,707
Hold her.

438
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,418
He'll kill us all!

439
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:35,943
Mom, are you okay? Mom!

440
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,825
Come with me
if you want to live.

441
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:45,452
It's okay, Mom.
He's here to help.

442
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,186
Go.

443
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:46,054
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

444
01:03:00,861 --> 01:03:02,696
Get down.

445
01:03:38,649 --> 01:03:40,192
Out of the car!

446
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:42,736
Right now!

447
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:08,261
Go!

448
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:20,732
I'm out.

449
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:29,449
- Come on.
- Here.

450
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:34,079
Reload.

451
01:04:43,005 --> 01:04:44,965
Last one!

452
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:53,765
Hang on.

453
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:21,501
Ready!

454
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:37,142
Here, drive.

455
01:06:30,362 --> 01:06:32,572
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

456
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:34,741
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

457
01:06:37,077 --> 01:06:38,245
Can you see anything?

458
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:40,747
I see everything.

459
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:45,252
Cool.

460
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:50,715
Come here.

461
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:58,265
I said I was okay.

462
01:06:59,057 --> 01:07:02,227
John, it was stupid of you
to go there.

463
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:05,438
You have to be smarter
than that.

464
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:07,107
You were almost killed.

465
01:07:08,275 --> 01:07:10,110
What were you thinking?

466
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:13,530
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me.

467
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:16,825
Do you understand?
You're too important.

468
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:19,578
Do you understand?

469
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:23,582
But...

470
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:28,962
I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.

471
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:32,591
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.

472
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:41,433
What's wrong with your eyes?

473
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:44,811
Nothing.

474
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:57,199
So, what's your story?

475
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:08,835
You okay?

476
01:08:08,919 --> 01:08:10,337
Fine.

477
01:08:12,172 --> 01:08:15,508
Say, that's a nice bike.

478
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:39,699
Watch it, lug nuts.

479
01:08:47,207 --> 01:08:50,627
Listen, do you know
what you're doing?

480
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:53,505
I have detailed files
on human anatomy.

481
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:56,383
I bet.

482
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:59,469
Makes you a more efficient killer,
right?

483
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:00,679
Correct.

484
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:08,728
Does it hurt
when you get shot?

485
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:13,233
I sense injuries.
The data could be called "pain."

486
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,487
John, help me with the light.

487
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,864
- Will these heal up?
- Yes.

488
01:09:19,948 --> 01:09:24,160
Good. If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.

489
01:09:24,244 --> 01:09:26,955
How long do you live?
I mean, last. Whatever.

490
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:30,333
A hundred and twenty years
with my existing power cell.

491
01:09:30,417 --> 01:09:33,336
Can you learn stuff that you
haven't been programmed with...

492
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:34,838
so you can be...

493
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:38,800
you know, more human...

494
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:41,594
and not such a dork
all the time?

495
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:48,310
My CPU is a neural net processor,
a learning computer.

496
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:52,731
But Skynet presets the switch
to read-only when we're sent out alone.

497
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:56,526
Doesn't want you to do
too much thinking, huh?

498
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:57,944
No.

499
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:01,781
Can we reset the switch?

500
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:24,262
Rotate the two locking cylinders
counterclockwise.

501
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:31,644
Do it.

502
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:42,280
Now open the port cover.

503
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:47,369
Pull to break the seal.

504
01:10:50,497 --> 01:10:54,501
Good, now remove
the shock-damping assembly.

505
01:10:58,046 --> 01:11:01,216
You can now access the CPU.

506
01:11:01,299 --> 01:11:03,676
- Do you see it?
- Yes.

507
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,680
Hold the CPU by its base tab.

508
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:09,182
Pull.

509
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:48,263
Do you see the pin switch?

510
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:50,223
No! No!

511
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:53,852
- Out of my way, John.
- Don't kill him.

512
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:57,230
It, John, not him.
It.

513
01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:00,775
Okay, it.
But we need it.

514
01:12:00,859 --> 01:12:03,486
Listen to me.
You listen.

515
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:05,697
We're better off on our own.

516
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,574
But he's the only proof we have...

517
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:10,160
of the future and the war
and all that.

518
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:11,619
Maybe.

519
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:16,291
I don't trust it.

520
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:18,084
But he's my friend, all right?

521
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:21,671
You don't know what it's like
to try to kill one of these things...

522
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:25,341
and if something goes wrong
this could be our last chance, so move!

523
01:12:25,425 --> 01:12:27,510
If I'm ever supposed to be
this great military leader...

524
01:12:27,594 --> 01:12:31,431
maybe you should start listening
to my leadership ideas once in a while.

525
01:12:34,434 --> 01:12:39,063
Because if my own mother won't,
how do you expect anyone else to?

526
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:56,331
All right, play it your way.

527
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:05,840
Was there a problem?

528
01:13:05,924 --> 01:13:07,425
No problem.

529
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:10,345
None whatsoever.

530
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:45,922
Are we learning yet?

531
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:01,312
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

532
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:06,651
Just head south.

533
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:16,995
Keep it under 65.

534
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:20,081
- We don't want to be pulled over.
- Affirmative.

535
01:14:23,293 --> 01:14:25,795
You gotta listen to the way
people talk.

536
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:29,382
You don't say "affirmative"
or some shit like that.

537
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:31,801
You say, <i>"No problemo."</i>

538
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:35,805
If someone comes off to you
with an attitude, you say, "Eat me."

539
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:40,184
And if you want to shine them on,
it's <i>"Hasta la vista, baby."</i>

540
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:45,523
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."

541
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:48,651
If someone gets upset,
you say, "Chill out."

542
01:14:48,735 --> 01:14:50,111
Or you can do combinations.

543
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:53,197
Chill out, dick-wad.

544
01:14:54,032 --> 01:14:56,034
That's great.
See? You're getting it.

545
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:10,131
You got any cash?

546
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:13,760
I got a couple hundred bucks.
I'll give you half.

547
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:15,511
Mom!

548
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:18,681
Get some food.

549
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:23,102
No sense of humor.

550
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:32,111
That's another thing.
You can lighten up a bit yourself.

551
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:35,198
This severe routine
is getting old, okay.

552
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:37,116
I mean, you're acting
like such a geek.

553
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,202
Smile once in a while.

554
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:40,620
Smile?

555
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:44,624
Yeah, you know, smile.
Watch.

556
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:49,337
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?

557
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:52,131
Give me a break.

558
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,051
Okay, bad example.

559
01:15:56,177 --> 01:15:57,845
See that guy over there?

560
01:15:57,929 --> 01:15:59,806
That's a smile.

561
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:20,618
That's good.

562
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:23,663
Maybe you could practice
in front of a mirror or something.

563
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,839
Want some of my fries?

564
01:16:42,849 --> 01:16:45,309
- Need any help?
- No.

565
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:48,479
- I got you!
- No, you didn't!

566
01:16:56,821 --> 01:16:59,824
We're not gonna make it, are we?

567
01:17:01,868 --> 01:17:03,077
People, I mean.

568
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:08,082
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

569
01:17:09,167 --> 01:17:12,086
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

570
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:15,423
Break it up before I wring
both of your necks.

571
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:20,303
I need to know
how Skynet gets built.

572
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:21,637
Who's responsible?

573
01:17:21,721 --> 01:17:25,266
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

574
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:27,059
Who is that?

575
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:31,063
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

576
01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:35,610
Why him?

577
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:39,071
In a few months, he creates
a revolutionary type of microprocessor.

578
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:41,449
Go on. Then what?

579
01:17:42,575 --> 01:17:45,495
In three years Cyberdyne will become
the largest supplier...

580
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:46,954
of military computer systems.

581
01:17:48,039 --> 01:17:50,958
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers...

582
01:17:51,042 --> 01:17:52,502
becoming fully unmanned.

583
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:55,630
Afterwards they fly with
a perfect operational record.

584
01:17:55,713 --> 01:17:58,341
The Skynet funding bill is passed.

585
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:01,719
The system goes on-line
on August 4, 1997.

586
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:04,972
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defense.

587
01:18:05,056 --> 01:18:07,767
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

588
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:12,146
It becomes self-aware
at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29.

589
01:18:13,231 --> 01:18:15,816
In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.

590
01:18:16,943 --> 01:18:19,195
- Skynet fights back.
- Yes.

591
01:18:19,278 --> 01:18:22,031
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

592
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:25,159
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

593
01:18:25,243 --> 01:18:29,622
Skynet knows the Russian counterattack
will eliminate its enemies over here.

594
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,791
Jesus.

595
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,795
How much do you know
about Dyson?

596
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:39,966
I have detailed files.

597
01:18:41,175 --> 01:18:43,135
I want to know everything.

598
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:48,432
What he looks like,
where he lives, everything.

599
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:01,487
Miles.

600
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:05,866
<i>Miles.</i>

601
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:25,511
Are you going to work all day?

602
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:29,473
I'm sorry, baby.
But this thing is just kicking my ass.

603
01:19:29,557 --> 01:19:30,850
Miles, it's Sunday.

604
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:33,686
You promised to take the kids
to Raging Waters today.

605
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:36,772
I can't...

606
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,150
I'm on a roll.

607
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:54,206
Baby, this is going
to blow them all away.

608
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:57,376
- It's a neural net processor.
- I know. You told me.

609
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:00,629
It's a neural net processor.
It thinks and learns like we do.

610
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:03,382
It's superconducting
at room temperature.

611
01:20:03,466 --> 01:20:07,720
Other computers are just
pocket calculators by comparison.

612
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,891
But why is that
so goddamn important, Miles?

613
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:13,309
I really need to know...

614
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:16,479
because sometimes I feel
like I'm going crazy here.

615
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:20,149
Baby, I am this close.

616
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:22,276
Come here.

617
01:20:24,904 --> 01:20:27,406
Imagine a jet airliner...

618
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:30,159
with a pilot that never gets tired,
never makes mistakes...

619
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:32,119
never shows up to work
with a hangover.

620
01:20:34,497 --> 01:20:36,916
Meet the pilot.

621
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:40,086
Why did we get married, Miles?
Why did we have these children?

622
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:41,212
You don't need us.

623
01:20:41,295 --> 01:20:44,715
Your heart and your mind
are in here.

624
01:20:44,799 --> 01:20:47,676
But it doesn't love you
like we do.

625
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:58,479
I'm sorry. Really.

626
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:02,817
How about spending some time
with your other babies?

627
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:07,321
<i>Raging Waters!</i>

628
01:21:36,976 --> 01:21:38,936
Wait in the car.

629
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:18,976
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

630
01:22:39,747 --> 01:22:41,499
Hey, big John.

631
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:43,250
What's up?

632
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:46,837
He's cool, Enrique.
He's with me.

633
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:50,090
He's... Uncle Bob.

634
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:52,384
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

635
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:54,220
Uncle Bob, huh?

636
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:56,555
Okay.

637
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:04,605
Drink?

638
01:23:09,944 --> 01:23:11,362
"Uncle Bob"?

639
01:23:13,364 --> 01:23:16,158
You're pretty famous,
all over the goddamn TV.

640
01:23:16,242 --> 01:23:18,911
Pictures of you, John,
your big friend here.

641
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,955
Cops are going nuts
looking for you.

642
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:28,837
I just came for my stuff.
I need clothes, food and a truck.

643
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:30,965
How about the fillings in my teeth?

644
01:23:31,048 --> 01:23:33,217
Now, Enrique.

645
01:23:34,552 --> 01:23:36,762
You two,
you're on weapons detail.

646
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:38,514
Let's go.

647
01:23:59,118 --> 01:24:01,036
One thing about my mom...

648
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:05,291
she always plans ahead.

649
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:17,177
Excellent.

650
01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:31,483
This is my best truck,
but the starter motor's gone.

651
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:33,485
You got time to change it out?

652
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:36,905
Yeah. I'm gonna wait till dark
to cross the border.

653
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:38,490
Enrique.

654
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:42,202
It's dangerous for you here.
You get out tonight too, okay?

655
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:44,747
Sure.

656
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:48,626
Just drop by anytime
and totally fuck up my life, all right?

657
01:24:53,047 --> 01:24:56,508
See, I grew up in places like this...

658
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:59,011
so I just thought
that's how people lived...

659
01:25:00,346 --> 01:25:03,057
riding around in helicopters...

660
01:25:04,141 --> 01:25:06,352
learning how to blow shit up.

661
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:10,522
But then when my mom got busted...

662
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:12,983
I got put into a regular school.

663
01:25:13,651 --> 01:25:16,403
All the other kids
were into Nintendo.

664
01:25:30,668 --> 01:25:32,795
Are you ever afraid?

665
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:34,171
No.

666
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:39,843
Not even of dying?

667
01:25:40,386 --> 01:25:42,346
No.

668
01:25:46,684 --> 01:25:50,938
You don't feel any emotion about it,
one way or another?

669
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:54,983
No. I have to stay functional
until my mission is complete.

670
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:03,117
Then it doesn't matter.

671
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:06,912
I have to stay functional too.
"I'm too important."

672
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,055
That's definitely you.

673
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:39,069
Most of the guys my mom
hung around with were geeks...

674
01:26:39,445 --> 01:26:42,948
but there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.

675
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:44,950
He taught me engines.

676
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:47,202
Hold here.

677
01:26:47,286 --> 01:26:49,705
Mom screwed it up, of course.

678
01:26:49,788 --> 01:26:52,207
She'd always tell 'em
about Judgment Day...

679
01:26:52,291 --> 01:26:55,085
and me being this world leader.

680
01:26:55,169 --> 01:26:57,129
That'd be all she wrote.

681
01:26:58,464 --> 01:26:59,590
Torque wrench, please.

682
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:06,346
I wish I could've met
my real dad.

683
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:08,182
You will.

684
01:27:08,265 --> 01:27:10,434
Yeah, I guess.

685
01:27:10,517 --> 01:27:14,354
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

686
01:27:14,438 --> 01:27:18,150
They sent him back through time
to 1984.

687
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:19,651
Man.

688
01:27:21,195 --> 01:27:23,655
He hasn't even been born yet.

689
01:27:25,449 --> 01:27:27,367
It messes with your head.

690
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:33,040
- The other bolt.
- Oh. Here.

691
01:27:39,379 --> 01:27:42,925
Mom and him were only together
for one night.

692
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:45,469
She still loves him, I guess.

693
01:27:45,552 --> 01:27:48,430
I see her crying sometimes.

694
01:27:48,514 --> 01:27:52,518
She denies it totally, of course,
like she got something stuck in her eye.

695
01:27:57,481 --> 01:27:59,024
Why do you cry?

696
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:01,610
- You mean people?
- Yeah.

697
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:03,070
I don't know.

698
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:05,239
We just cry...

699
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:07,866
you know, when it hurts.

700
01:28:13,956 --> 01:28:15,707
Pain causes it?

701
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:18,919
No. It's different.

702
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:22,297
It's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyway.

703
01:28:22,381 --> 01:28:23,966
- You get it?
- No.

704
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:26,927
All right, my man!

705
01:28:28,762 --> 01:28:30,389
Give me five.

706
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:34,560
Just put out your hand
like this.

707
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:40,232
All right! Now hit me.
Give me five. Do the same thing.

708
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:47,406
Okay, that's good.
Up high.

709
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:49,658
Five low.

710
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:51,410
Too slow.

711
01:28:54,413 --> 01:28:56,665
I'm just kidding.
One more time.

712
01:28:56,748 --> 01:28:58,959
Good. Now try it.

713
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:01,003
Now do me.
Give me five.

714
01:29:02,462 --> 01:29:07,009
<i>Watching John with the machine,
it was suddenly so clear.</i>

715
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:10,012
<i>The Terminator would never stop.</i>

716
01:29:10,095 --> 01:29:14,057
<i>It would never leave him,
never hurt him...</i>

717
01:29:14,141 --> 01:29:17,561
<i>never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him...</i>

718
01:29:17,644 --> 01:29:20,230
<i>or be too busy
to spend time with him.</i>

719
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:23,191
<i>It would always be there...</i>

720
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:25,944
<i>and it would die
to protect him.</i>

721
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:30,699
<i>Of all the would-be fathers
who came and went over the years...</i>

722
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:32,826
<i>this thing, this machine...</i>

723
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:35,287
<i>was the only one
who measured up.</i>

724
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:37,873
<i>In an insane world...</i>

725
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:39,916
<i>it was the sanest choice.</i>

726
01:31:17,681 --> 01:31:19,641
Hey, let's try this one.

727
01:31:25,272 --> 01:31:27,441
There we go.

728
01:33:13,547 --> 01:33:16,049
She said go south with him
like you planned.

729
01:33:16,132 --> 01:33:18,343
- She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom!

730
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:21,304
Mom, wait!

731
01:33:36,570 --> 01:33:38,029
"No fate."

732
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:41,700
No fate but what we make.

733
01:33:43,827 --> 01:33:45,829
My father told her this.

734
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:52,669
I made him memorize it in the future
as a message to her.

735
01:33:54,337 --> 01:33:56,256
Never mind.

736
01:33:56,339 --> 01:33:59,676
Okay, the whole thing goes...

737
01:33:59,759 --> 01:34:02,470
The future's not set.

738
01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:06,057
There's no fate but what
we make for ourselves.

739
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:09,144
She intends to change the future.

740
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:10,687
Yeah, I guess.

741
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:14,065
Oh, shit!

742
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:16,067
- Dyson.
- Yeah.

743
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:19,654
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

744
01:34:19,738 --> 01:34:21,740
She's gonna blow him away.

745
01:34:21,823 --> 01:34:23,909
Come on! Let's go!

746
01:34:36,296 --> 01:34:38,340
This is tactically dangerous.

747
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:39,549
Drive faster.

748
01:34:39,633 --> 01:34:42,135
The T-1000 has the same files
that I do.

749
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:45,639
It knows what I know.
It might anticipate this move.

750
01:34:45,722 --> 01:34:48,224
I don't care.
We gotta stop her.

751
01:34:48,308 --> 01:34:50,226
Killing Dyson
might prevent the war.

752
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:53,813
I don't care!
Haven't you learned anything yet?

753
01:34:53,897 --> 01:34:56,983
Haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?

754
01:34:59,861 --> 01:35:02,364
Look, maybe you don't care
if you live or die...

755
01:35:02,447 --> 01:35:04,616
but everybody's not like that.

756
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:08,286
We have feelings.
We hurt. We're afraid.

757
01:35:10,789 --> 01:35:14,459
You got to learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. It's important.

758
01:35:52,122 --> 01:35:54,749
Danny, I told you to go to bed,
like your sister.

759
01:35:54,833 --> 01:35:58,211
Just a couple of minutes, Mom!

760
01:36:14,352 --> 01:36:16,688
Danny, your time is up!

761
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:19,691
Come brush your teeth
and get to bed.

762
01:37:01,483 --> 01:37:02,817
Daddy!

763
01:37:02,901 --> 01:37:05,403
Danny, go! Go!

764
01:37:13,369 --> 01:37:15,789
- Tarissa, run!
- Oh, my God!

765
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:24,923
Just take Danny and run!

766
01:37:25,006 --> 01:37:26,257
Run!

767
01:37:26,341 --> 01:37:28,093
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

768
01:37:46,986 --> 01:37:47,987
Daddy!

769
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:51,157
Nobody fucking move!

770
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:53,243
Don't hurt my daddy!

771
01:37:53,326 --> 01:37:54,869
On the floor, bitch.

772
01:37:54,953 --> 01:37:57,122
Get down now!

773
01:37:57,997 --> 01:37:59,082
Get out of the way!

774
01:37:59,165 --> 01:38:00,625
Don't hurt him!

775
01:38:02,127 --> 01:38:04,129
Get on the floor now!

776
01:38:07,173 --> 01:38:08,883
Just let the boy go.

777
01:38:08,967 --> 01:38:10,552
Shut up. Shut up.

778
01:38:10,635 --> 01:38:11,928
Shut up!

779
01:38:12,011 --> 01:38:14,597
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

780
01:38:14,681 --> 01:38:16,933
- It's all your fault!
- What?

781
01:38:17,016 --> 01:38:19,144
I'm not gonna let you do it.

782
01:39:11,154 --> 01:39:13,239
Shit! We're too late!

783
01:39:17,744 --> 01:39:18,870
Check them.

784
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:24,542
Look at me, Mom.

785
01:39:24,626 --> 01:39:26,836
Are you hurt?

786
01:39:30,465 --> 01:39:32,550
I almost...

787
01:39:44,187 --> 01:39:46,522
It'll be okay.

788
01:39:46,606 --> 01:39:48,566
We'll figure something out.
Okay?

789
01:39:50,151 --> 01:39:51,778
I promise.

790
01:39:55,073 --> 01:39:58,034
You came here to stop me.

791
01:39:58,910 --> 01:40:00,870
Yeah, I did.

792
01:40:03,748 --> 01:40:05,750
I love you, John.

793
01:40:07,418 --> 01:40:09,003
I always have.

794
01:40:10,922 --> 01:40:12,340
I know.

795
01:40:19,347 --> 01:40:21,557
Deep penetration.

796
01:40:23,142 --> 01:40:25,061
No shattered bone.

797
01:40:25,144 --> 01:40:28,106
Hold here.
The pressure should stop the bleeding.

798
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:40,285
Who are you people?

799
01:40:41,244 --> 01:40:42,662
Show him.

800
01:40:45,331 --> 01:40:49,502
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Show me your room.

801
01:41:30,001 --> 01:41:31,210
Oh, my God.

802
01:41:31,294 --> 01:41:33,963
Now listen to me
very carefully.

803
01:41:39,844 --> 01:41:43,973
<i>Dyson listened while the Terminator
laid it all down.</i>

804
01:41:44,057 --> 01:41:47,935
<i>Skynet. Judgment Day.</i>

805
01:41:48,019 --> 01:41:50,313
<i>The history of things to come.</i>

806
01:41:51,731 --> 01:41:54,484
<i>It's not every day that
you find out you're responsible...</i>

807
01:41:54,567 --> 01:41:57,403
<i>for three billion deaths.</i>

808
01:41:57,487 --> 01:41:59,405
<i>He took it pretty well.</i>

809
01:42:01,407 --> 01:42:03,868
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

810
01:42:09,874 --> 01:42:12,001
You're judging me...

811
01:42:12,085 --> 01:42:14,545
on things I haven't even done yet.

812
01:42:18,758 --> 01:42:20,885
How were we supposed to know?

813
01:42:23,346 --> 01:42:25,306
Yeah.

814
01:42:25,390 --> 01:42:27,767
Right.

815
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:29,977
How were you supposed to know?

816
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:34,732
Fucking men like you
built the hydrogen bomb.

817
01:42:34,816 --> 01:42:37,402
Men like you...

818
01:42:37,485 --> 01:42:38,903
thought it up.

819
01:42:42,782 --> 01:42:44,742
You think you're so creative.

820
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:49,247
You don't know what it's like
to really create something...

821
01:42:49,330 --> 01:42:51,457
to create a life...

822
01:42:51,541 --> 01:42:53,084
to feel it growing inside you.

823
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:56,087
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

824
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:57,839
Mom!

825
01:42:57,922 --> 01:43:01,676
We need to be a little more
constructive here. Okay?

826
01:43:01,759 --> 01:43:03,845
We still have to stop this
from happening, don't we?

827
01:43:03,928 --> 01:43:06,764
But I thought...

828
01:43:06,848 --> 01:43:10,852
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

829
01:43:10,935 --> 01:43:15,731
That's right. There's no way I'm going
to finish the new processor. Not now.

830
01:43:15,815 --> 01:43:19,277
Forget it. I'm out of it.
I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.

831
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:21,237
That's not good enough.

832
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:23,239
No one must follow your work.

833
01:43:23,322 --> 01:43:25,199
Right.

834
01:43:25,283 --> 01:43:29,620
All right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab...

835
01:43:29,704 --> 01:43:31,289
the files, the disk drives...

836
01:43:31,372 --> 01:43:34,000
everything here.

837
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:36,169
Everything.

838
01:43:36,252 --> 01:43:38,171
I don't care.

839
01:43:39,464 --> 01:43:40,465
The chip.

840
01:43:40,548 --> 01:43:42,633
- Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

841
01:43:42,717 --> 01:43:45,136
It's at Cyberdyne.
It's from the other one like you.

842
01:43:45,219 --> 01:43:47,930
The CPU from the first Terminator.

843
01:43:48,014 --> 01:43:50,391
Son of a bitch!
I knew it!

844
01:43:50,475 --> 01:43:53,186
They told us not to ask
where they got it.

845
01:43:53,269 --> 01:43:55,605
Those lying motherfuckers.

846
01:43:55,688 --> 01:43:57,482
It's scary stuff.
Radically advanced.

847
01:43:57,565 --> 01:43:58,691
It was smashed.

848
01:43:58,774 --> 01:44:02,403
It didn't work, but it gave us ideas,
took us in new directions.

849
01:44:02,487 --> 01:44:04,489
Things we would've never...

850
01:44:06,657 --> 01:44:08,743
All my work was based on it.

851
01:44:08,826 --> 01:44:10,661
It must be destroyed.

852
01:44:12,914 --> 01:44:15,917
Can you get us in?
Past security?

853
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,085
I think so, yeah. When?

854
01:44:23,007 --> 01:44:24,008
Now?

855
01:44:27,929 --> 01:44:30,973
<i>The future,
always so clear to me...</i>

856
01:44:31,057 --> 01:44:34,060
<i>had become like
a black highway at night.</i>

857
01:44:34,143 --> 01:44:36,854
<i>We were in
uncharted territory now...</i>

858
01:44:36,938 --> 01:44:39,857
<i>making up history
as we went along.</i>

859
01:45:18,187 --> 01:45:20,106
Carl, right?

860
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:24,860
Friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd...

861
01:45:24,944 --> 01:45:26,946
take 'em upstairs
and show 'em around.

862
01:45:27,029 --> 01:45:30,324
Mr. Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

863
01:45:30,408 --> 01:45:32,577
I need written authorization...

864
01:45:33,619 --> 01:45:35,621
I insist.

865
01:45:35,705 --> 01:45:37,456
Don't even think about it.

866
01:45:48,426 --> 01:45:49,885
It's okay.

867
01:45:51,304 --> 01:45:54,432
It takes two keys, turned
simultaneously, to open the vault.

868
01:45:54,515 --> 01:45:57,435
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

869
01:45:58,769 --> 01:46:00,229
Gibbons?

870
01:46:03,274 --> 01:46:05,109
Gibbons! Come on, man!

871
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:08,279
You can't leave the desk
like that!

872
01:46:13,117 --> 01:46:14,619
Oh, shit.

873
01:46:32,178 --> 01:46:34,180
My card should access this.

874
01:46:38,851 --> 01:46:41,270
- What is it?
- Damn it.

875
01:46:41,354 --> 01:46:43,314
The silent alarm's been tripped.

876
01:46:49,487 --> 01:46:52,239
It's neutralized all the codes
in the entire building.

877
01:46:52,323 --> 01:46:54,241
Nothing will open anywhere now.

878
01:46:55,326 --> 01:46:57,161
We have to abort.

879
01:47:00,373 --> 01:47:03,793
We go all the way.
Okay?

880
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:09,715
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

881
01:47:09,799 --> 01:47:12,259
- I think it's that guy from the mall.
- It is.

882
01:47:12,343 --> 01:47:14,261
It's him and the woman.

883
01:47:15,846 --> 01:47:19,016
Just send everything
you got in the area right now.

884
01:47:21,227 --> 01:47:24,689
I have a personal entry code
for the lab. It may still work.

885
01:47:29,193 --> 01:47:30,236
It's no good.

886
01:47:30,319 --> 01:47:31,862
Let me try mine.

887
01:47:36,826 --> 01:47:38,911
John, fire in the hole!

888
01:47:50,965 --> 01:47:55,761
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the Halon system.

889
01:48:02,935 --> 01:48:05,396
You have to wait
until the gas clears.

890
01:48:07,898 --> 01:48:09,191
Put this on.

891
01:48:23,164 --> 01:48:25,666
All right, let's get to work.

892
01:48:46,854 --> 01:48:50,149
<i>All units in the vicinity
and all units able to respond...</i>

893
01:48:50,232 --> 01:48:55,029
<i>a 211 in progress, 2144 Kramer Street,
the Cyberdyne building.</i>

894
01:48:55,112 --> 01:48:56,781
<i>Suspect one is white female...</i>

895
01:48:56,864 --> 01:49:00,326
<i>identified as last name Connor,
first name Sarah.</i>

896
01:49:00,409 --> 01:49:03,329
<i>Escaped last night
from Pescadero State Hospital.</i>

897
01:49:03,412 --> 01:49:05,289
<i>Suspect two: White male...</i>

898
01:49:09,043 --> 01:49:11,170
All the disks in my office...

899
01:49:11,253 --> 01:49:13,380
all the disks
in that office over there...

900
01:49:13,464 --> 01:49:15,466
everything behind my desk...

901
01:49:15,549 --> 01:49:17,802
and all the processors
on my left.

902
01:49:17,885 --> 01:49:20,471
We'll blow those with the C4.

903
01:49:34,068 --> 01:49:36,111
Can I...

904
01:49:36,195 --> 01:49:37,988
Excuse me.

905
01:49:39,657 --> 01:49:42,284
Can I borrow that thing?

906
01:49:51,418 --> 01:49:53,712
I worked a lot of years on this thing.

907
01:49:57,883 --> 01:49:59,927
<i>One-Mary-23,
give me that location again.</i>

908
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:01,762
<i>2111 Kramer.</i>

909
01:50:01,846 --> 01:50:04,974
<i>Suspects are armed and
considered extremely dangerous.</i>

910
01:50:57,234 --> 01:50:59,028
All right.

911
01:50:59,111 --> 01:51:00,904
7-2-5-6.

912
01:51:07,745 --> 01:51:09,079
Easy money.

913
01:51:18,172 --> 01:51:20,591
Oh, shit. Not good.

914
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:27,306
How we doing?

915
01:51:27,389 --> 01:51:29,058
Primer cord is set.

916
01:51:29,141 --> 01:51:31,602
One more barrel,
two more minutes.

917
01:51:35,481 --> 01:51:38,400
- How do we set them off?
- Remote control.

918
01:51:38,484 --> 01:51:40,861
Piece of cake.

919
01:51:40,944 --> 01:51:42,488
- We got company.
- Police?

920
01:51:42,571 --> 01:51:45,908
- How many?
- All of 'em, I think.

921
01:51:45,991 --> 01:51:47,409
Go. I'll finish here.

922
01:51:49,370 --> 01:51:50,788
Come on.

923
01:51:51,872 --> 01:51:53,791
I'll take care of the police.

924
01:51:53,874 --> 01:51:55,167
Wait! You swore!

925
01:51:58,128 --> 01:51:59,588
Trust me.

926
01:52:12,851 --> 01:52:14,478
<i>You at the window!</i>

927
01:52:14,561 --> 01:52:18,023
<i>Drop your weapon and place
your hands on top of your head!</i>

928
01:52:19,358 --> 01:52:21,193
Holy shit!

929
01:52:21,276 --> 01:52:22,820
That's a mini-gun!

930
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:47,386
- Come on!
- Oh, shit!

931
01:52:47,469 --> 01:52:49,012
Go! Go! Go!

932
01:53:36,602 --> 01:53:38,061
Fire!

933
01:53:55,412 --> 01:53:57,039
Same time, to the left.

934
01:53:57,122 --> 01:53:59,458
One, two, three, go.

935
01:54:11,595 --> 01:54:14,431
In order to get that out...

936
01:54:21,230 --> 01:54:23,982
We got Skynet by the balls now.

937
01:54:24,066 --> 01:54:25,776
Come on, let's book.

938
01:54:26,693 --> 01:54:28,612
Hold your fire!

939
01:54:53,804 --> 01:54:56,306
- Ready to rock?
- Ready.

940
01:54:59,059 --> 01:55:00,352
Time to go.

941
01:55:00,435 --> 01:55:01,895
Now.

942
01:55:01,979 --> 01:55:05,524
- Take this. They'll use gas.
- Come on.

943
01:55:05,607 --> 01:55:08,694
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

944
01:55:32,968 --> 01:55:35,721
Mom! Mom!

945
01:56:20,098 --> 01:56:21,224
Shit!

946
01:56:22,643 --> 01:56:25,562
She's in the clean room.
There's no way outta there.

947
01:56:35,072 --> 01:56:36,073
Get down!

948
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:44,998
Here.

949
01:57:10,524 --> 01:57:13,944
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

950
01:57:18,115 --> 01:57:19,616
Fall back!

951
01:57:19,700 --> 01:57:21,284
Everybody out!

952
01:57:21,368 --> 01:57:23,286
Fall back now!
Go! Go! Go!

953
01:57:58,697 --> 01:58:00,657
<i>We got a war zone here!</i>

954
01:58:32,564 --> 01:58:34,274
Shut your eyes.

955
01:58:40,864 --> 01:58:44,034
Stay here. I'll be back.

956
01:58:51,875 --> 01:58:54,211
Get down on the floor!
Face down!

957
01:58:56,922 --> 01:58:58,507
On the floor now!

958
01:59:00,842 --> 01:59:02,344
Okay, drop him!

959
02:00:22,215 --> 02:00:23,633
Here, hold this.

960
02:00:57,042 --> 02:00:58,043
Go!

961
02:01:36,998 --> 02:01:37,916
Shit!

962
02:01:51,513 --> 02:01:53,223
Get out.

963
02:02:12,242 --> 02:02:13,535
Listen.

964
02:02:13,618 --> 02:02:16,329
No matter what happens,
stay under these vests.

965
02:02:16,413 --> 02:02:17,664
- You got it?
- Yeah.

966
02:02:17,747 --> 02:02:19,207
All right.

967
02:02:33,763 --> 02:02:35,015
Chopper's coming in!

968
02:02:35,098 --> 02:02:36,224
It's him.

969
02:03:33,990 --> 02:03:35,325
Shit!

970
02:03:38,203 --> 02:03:39,996
Stay down!

971
02:04:54,279 --> 02:04:56,739
Goddamn! You all right?

972
02:05:04,247 --> 02:05:06,666
Come on, Mom,
we gotta get out.

973
02:05:08,585 --> 02:05:10,211
Take the shotgun.

974
02:05:13,465 --> 02:05:15,049
Are you hurt?

975
02:05:28,229 --> 02:05:31,149
Holy shit.
Come on, Mom. Come on!

976
02:05:31,232 --> 02:05:33,943
- We need your truck.
- Hurry!

977
02:05:38,948 --> 02:05:41,451
- Come on. Hurry.
- Get in.

978
02:05:44,454 --> 02:05:45,663
Go!

979
02:05:51,669 --> 02:05:53,671
What the hell...

980
02:05:59,552 --> 02:06:02,305
- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

981
02:06:03,973 --> 02:06:05,642
Here. This'll work.

982
02:06:11,231 --> 02:06:12,941
He's gaining.

983
02:06:15,485 --> 02:06:17,153
Step on it!

984
02:06:17,237 --> 02:06:20,031
- This is the vehicle's top speed.
- I can run faster than this!

985
02:06:30,875 --> 02:06:32,335
Coming up, to the right.

986
02:06:34,379 --> 02:06:36,339
Watch it! Watch it!

987
02:06:58,903 --> 02:07:01,030
- Drive.
- Where are you going?

988
02:07:08,496 --> 02:07:10,415
Take the off-ramp.

989
02:07:20,091 --> 02:07:21,259
Shit!

990
02:07:24,429 --> 02:07:25,513
Hold on!

991
02:08:11,351 --> 02:08:12,977
Don't stop!

992
02:08:20,818 --> 02:08:22,236
Go straight!

993
02:08:24,864 --> 02:08:27,158
- Look out!
- Duck!

994
02:08:41,297 --> 02:08:43,257
Get the hell outta here!

995
02:08:48,763 --> 02:08:51,808
Get outta here!
Let's go! Come on!

996
02:10:08,801 --> 02:10:11,262
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

997
02:11:00,853 --> 02:11:02,271
We don't have much time.

998
02:11:24,877 --> 02:11:26,128
Let's go.

999
02:11:27,213 --> 02:11:29,006
We gotta get outta here.

1000
02:11:29,090 --> 02:11:31,175
Come on! Get up!

1001
02:11:44,772 --> 02:11:46,482
Hand me the shotgun.

1002
02:11:51,320 --> 02:11:53,614
Put your weight on me, Mom.

1003
02:11:54,407 --> 02:11:56,325
Hurry!

1004
02:11:59,871 --> 02:12:01,497
Come on, Mom.

1005
02:12:08,004 --> 02:12:09,338
Get up!

1006
02:12:40,870 --> 02:12:42,830
This way. Come on.

1007
02:13:09,857 --> 02:13:11,525
No! Wait!

1008
02:13:11,817 --> 02:13:15,738
Wait. No. No.
It's too hot. Go back.

1009
02:13:23,955 --> 02:13:26,207
- Go. Run.
- No! We gotta stick together.

1010
02:13:26,290 --> 02:13:28,292
John, you've got to go now.

1011
02:13:28,376 --> 02:13:30,544
- John!
- Go! Now!

1012
02:14:44,994 --> 02:14:46,787
Get up the steps.

1013
02:14:54,170 --> 02:14:55,671
Get up.

1014
02:14:56,464 --> 02:14:58,632
Come on, Mom.
I got you.

1015
02:15:33,042 --> 02:15:35,377
Grab the chain. Grab it.

1016
02:15:36,754 --> 02:15:39,507
Grab it. Go. Go!

1017
02:15:49,850 --> 02:15:53,187
Mom, come on! Mom!

1018
02:16:42,319 --> 02:16:44,113
Call to John.

1019
02:16:46,907 --> 02:16:48,784
I know this hurts.

1020
02:16:50,578 --> 02:16:52,246
Call John.

1021
02:17:08,637 --> 02:17:11,307
Call to John now.

1022
02:17:13,309 --> 02:17:15,186
Fuck you.

1023
02:20:32,716 --> 02:20:34,176
Help!

1024
02:20:54,822 --> 02:20:56,406
Mom.

1025
02:21:01,620 --> 02:21:03,997
- Help me.
- Get out of the way, John.

1026
02:21:04,957 --> 02:21:07,209
- John! John!
- Shoot!

1027
02:22:03,223 --> 02:22:05,642
Get down!

1028
02:23:38,944 --> 02:23:41,113
Get up. Come on.

1029
02:23:43,365 --> 02:23:45,158
Holy shit.

1030
02:23:45,242 --> 02:23:47,703
I need a vacation.

1031
02:24:00,924 --> 02:24:03,719
Is it dead?

1032
02:24:03,802 --> 02:24:05,220
Terminated.

1033
02:24:08,724 --> 02:24:10,392
Will this melt in there?

1034
02:24:13,353 --> 02:24:15,230
Yes. Throw it in.

1035
02:24:22,321 --> 02:24:24,239
And the chip.

1036
02:24:39,421 --> 02:24:41,048
It's over.

1037
02:24:47,888 --> 02:24:49,556
There's one more chip.

1038
02:24:54,227 --> 02:24:56,480
And it must be destroyed also.

1039
02:25:01,943 --> 02:25:03,528
Here.

1040
02:25:03,612 --> 02:25:06,990
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

1041
02:25:20,128 --> 02:25:22,589
I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.

1042
02:25:22,672 --> 02:25:24,966
No, it'll be okay.
Stay with us.

1043
02:25:25,050 --> 02:25:27,052
- It'll be okay.
- I have to go away.

1044
02:25:27,135 --> 02:25:29,721
No, don't do it.
Please, don't go.

1045
02:25:29,805 --> 02:25:32,891
I must go away, John.

1046
02:25:32,974 --> 02:25:34,434
No, wait.

1047
02:25:34,518 --> 02:25:37,437
- You don't have to do this.
- I'm sorry.

1048
02:25:38,355 --> 02:25:40,607
No, don't do it! Don't go!

1049
02:25:40,690 --> 02:25:42,651
It has to end here.

1050
02:25:43,860 --> 02:25:47,155
I order you not to go!

1051
02:25:55,122 --> 02:25:57,165
I know now why you cry.

1052
02:25:59,543 --> 02:26:02,004
But it's something
I can never do.

1053
02:26:36,329 --> 02:26:38,540
Good-bye.

1054
02:28:17,597 --> 02:28:20,642
<i>The unknown future
rolls toward us.</i>

1055
02:28:20,725 --> 02:28:24,646
<i>I face it for the first time
with a sense of hope.</i>

1056
02:28:24,729 --> 02:28:27,065
<i>Because if a machine,
a Terminator...</i>

1057
02:28:27,148 --> 02:28:30,485
<i>can learn the value
of human life...</i>

1058
02:28:30,569 --> 02:28:32,237
<i>maybe we can too.</i>
