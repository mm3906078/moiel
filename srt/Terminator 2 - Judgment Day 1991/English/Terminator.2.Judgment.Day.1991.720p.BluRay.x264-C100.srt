1
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,800
Three billion human lives ended
on August 29, 1997.

2
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,400
The survivors of the nuclear fire...

3
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,200
called the war "Judgment Day."

4
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,400
They lived only to face
a new nightmare...

5
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,480
the war against the machines.

6
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,440
The computer which controlled
the machines, Skynet...

7
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,520
sent two Terminators
back through time.

8
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,640
Their mission: to destroy the leader
of the human resistance.

9
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,320
John Connor, my son.

10
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,840
The first Terminator was programmed
to strike at me...

11
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,880
in the year 1984...

12
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,280
before John was born.

13
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,200
It failed.

14
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,120
The second was set to strike
at John himself...

15
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,680
when he was still a child.

16
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,120
As before, the resistance was able
to send a lone warrior...

17
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,480
a protector for John.

18
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,960
It was just a question of which one
of them would reach him first.

19
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,920
I need your clothes, your boots
and your motorcycle.

20
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,040
You forgot to say please.

21
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,440
Get him off me!

22
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,000
Pull it out!

23
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,760
Take it.

24
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,880
Can't let you take
the man's wheels, son.

25
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,760
Now, get off
before I put you down.

26
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,040
That's it, goddamn it.

27
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,920
R-31 David, Sherman Code 6...

28
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,920
at the Sixth Street Bridge and Santa Fe
on electrical disturbance.

29
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,240
Ten-four, R-31 David.

30
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,200
"JMA Query: Connor, John"

31
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,080
John, get in there and clean up
that pigsty of yours.

32
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,840
Your foster parents
are kind of dicks, huh?

33
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,240
I swear, I have had it
with that goddamn kid.

34
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,960
- He won't even answer me anymore.
- Honey, move.

35
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,960
Would you get off your butt
and help me?

36
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,880
- Todd!
- What?

37
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,320
He hasn't cleaned that room of his
in a month.

38
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,520
Oh, it's an emergency.
Hang on. I'll get right on it.

39
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,000
Come on.

40
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,280
Get your ass inside.
Do what your mother tells you.

41
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,240
She's not my mother, Todd.

42
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,440
This next patient is interesting.

43
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,960
I've been following the case
for years.

44
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,120
A 29-year-old female...

45
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,160
diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

46
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,480
The usual indicators: depression,
anxiety, violent acting out...

47
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,280
delusions of persecution.

48
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,080
The delusional architecture
is fairly unique.

49
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,000
She believes that a machine
called the Terminator...

50
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,440
which looks human,
was sent back through time...

51
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,560
to kill her.
- That's original.

52
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,880
And also that the father
of her child...

53
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,240
was a soldier sent back
to protect her.

54
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,240
He was from the future too.

55
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,960
The year 2029,
if I remember correctly.

56
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,200
And here we are.

57
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,120
Morning, Sarah.

58
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,400
Good morning, Dr. Silberman.
How's the knee?

59
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,200
Fine, Sarah.

60
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,600
She stabbed me in the kneecap...

61
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,200
with my pen a few weeks ago.

62
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,720
Repeated escape attempts.

63
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,320
Let's move on, shall we?

64
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,720
I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.

65
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,320
- See she takes her Thorazine.
- Sure. I'll take care of it.

66
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,880
Are you the legal guardian
of John Connor?

67
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,520
That's right, Officer.
What's he done now?

68
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,560
- Could I speak with him, please?
- You could if he were here.

69
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,480
He took off on his bike this morning.
He could be anywhere.

70
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,880
Do you have a photograph of John?

71
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,200
Yeah. Hold on.

72
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,400
Gonna tell me what this is about?

73
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,040
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

74
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,040
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?

75
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,600
No, go on. There was a guy here
this morning looking for him too.

76
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,880
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.

77
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,400
Has that got something
to do with this?

78
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,840
I wouldn't worry about him.

79
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,720
Thanks for your cooperation.

80
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,720
Please insert your stolen card now.

81
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,720
PIN number.

82
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,560
Hurry up. This is taking too long.

83
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,160
Go, baby.

84
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,160
All right.

85
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,000
- PIN number 9003.
- Where'd you learn this stuff from?

86
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,560
From my mom.
My real mom, I mean.

87
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,880
Withdraw 300 bucks.

88
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,760
Come on, baby. Come on!

89
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,080
- Yes!
- Hey, it worked.

90
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,800
All right. Easy money.
Come on!

91
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,440
Yes! Piece of cake.

92
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,840
- ls that her?
- Yes.

93
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,760
She's pretty cool, huh?

94
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,120
No, she's a complete psycho.

95
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,880
That's why she's at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute.

96
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,680
She tried to blow up a computer factory
but got shot and arrested.

97
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,840
No shit.

98
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,960
She's a total loser.

99
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,720
Come on.
Let's go spend some money.

100
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,760
It's like a giant strobe light...

101
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,160
burning right through my eyes.

102
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,640
Somehow I can still see.

103
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,480
Oh, God.

104
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,280
We know the dream's the same
every night.

105
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,720
- Why do I have to...
- Please continue.

106
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,200
Children look like burnt paper.

107
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,960
Black.

108
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,960
Not moving.

109
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,200
And then the blast wave hits them.

110
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,200
And they fly apart like leaves.

111
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,080
Dreams...

112
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,360
of cataclysm,
the end of the world...

113
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,360
are very common.

114
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,280
It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.

115
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,320
- I know the date it happens.
- I'm sure it feels real to you.

116
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,880
On August 29, 1997...

117
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,480
it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin' real to you too!

118
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:35,280
Anybody not wearing two-million sunblock
is gonna have a real bad day. Get it?

119
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,200
God, you think
you're safe and alive.

120
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,560
You're already dead. Everybody!

121
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,160
Him. You. You're dead already.

122
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,160
This whole place,
everything you see is gone!

123
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,280
You're the one living in the dream,
'cause I know it happened!

124
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,280
It happened!

125
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,320
I feel much better now.

126
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,320
Clearer.

127
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,160
Yes, your attitude has been...

128
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,520
much improved lately.

129
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,360
It's helped me to have a goal...

130
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,640
something to look forward to.

131
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,840
What is that?

132
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,280
Well, you said...

133
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,240
that if I showed improvement
after six months...

134
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,960
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing...

135
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,800
and I could have visitors.

136
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,960
Well, it's been six months...

137
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,480
and...

138
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,880
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

139
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,880
I see.

140
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,800
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

141
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,400
Now you think they don't exist?

142
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,840
They don't exist.

143
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,600
I know that now.

144
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,840
But you've told me on many occasions
about how you crushed one...

145
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,000
in a hydraulic press.

146
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,520
If I had, there would have
been some evidence.

147
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,000
They would have found something
at the factory.

148
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,200
I see.

149
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,680
So you don't believe anymore
that the company covered it up?

150
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,840
No. Why would they?

151
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,200
Let's try a new position
right there.

152
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,440
Mr. Dyson?

153
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,120
The materials team
is running another...

154
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,880
- Mr. Dyson.
- Yes?

155
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,960
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

156
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,960
You have to sign for the... it.

157
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,880
- You have to sign it out.
- Okay. I'll get it.

158
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,920
I know I haven't been here long,
but I was wondering if you know...

159
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,360
Know what?

160
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,080
If you know where 'it' came from.

161
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,600
I asked them the same question once.
You know what they told me?

162
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,600
Don't ask.

163
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,560
- Good morning, Mr. Dyson.
- How's it going?

164
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,600
Insert key.
Left on three.

165
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,000
Two, one, turn.

166
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,280
- How are the wife and kids?
- Great. Thanks.

167
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,560
So what do you think, Doctor?

168
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,400
Haven't I shown improvement?

169
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,440
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

170
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,000
I know how smart you are.

171
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,080
You're just telling me
what I want to hear.

172
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,200
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

173
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,120
If I put you in minimum security,
you'll just try to escape again.

174
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,320
You have to let me see my son.

175
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,160
Please.

176
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,320
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

177
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,200
If I could make a phone call...

178
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,720
I'm afraid not.
Not for a while.

179
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,440
I don't see any choice but to
recommend to the review board...

180
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,040
that you stay here
for another six months.

181
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,520
I'll kill you,
you son of a bitch!

182
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,520
You son of a bitch!

183
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,880
Ten CCs of sodium amobarbital, stat!

184
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,440
You don't know what you're doing!

185
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,640
Get some restraints in here now!

186
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,440
You don't know what you're doing!

187
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,560
Model citizen.

188
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,320
You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

189
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,560
- He was going to the galleria.
- Yeah.

190
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,400
The galleria?

191
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,840
I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right?

192
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,560
- Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?

193
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,080
Hey, do you know this guy?

194
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,320
Nah, I don't know him.

195
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,040
- John.
- Not now.

196
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,400
There's this cop scoping for you.
Check it out.

197
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,880
- He's right over there.
- Split, man.

198
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,400
- Just go.
- Yeah.

199
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,360
I saw that kid...

200
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,640
You're not supposed to
be in here!

201
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,560
Get down.

202
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,480
Mister, are you all right?

203
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,880
You all right?

204
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,360
Come on!

205
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,680
Goddamn!

206
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,520
Okay, time-out.
Stop the bike.

207
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,200
Time out.
Come on, stop the bike.

208
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,000
Holy shit.
Now, don't take this the wrong way.

209
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,480
- You are a Terminator, right?
- Yes.

210
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,360
Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.

211
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,920
Holy shit.

212
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,000
You're really real.

213
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,000
I mean...

214
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,520
You're like a machine underneath,
right?

215
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,080
But alive outside?

216
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,080
I'm a cybernetic organism.

217
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,840
Living tissue
over metal endoskeleton.

218
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,880
This is intense.

219
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,720
Get a grip, John. Okay.

220
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,440
You're not here to kill me.

221
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:58,480
I figured that part out for myself.
So what's the deal?

222
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,280
My mission is to protect you.

223
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,000
Yeah? Who sent you?

224
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,360
You did.

225
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,640
Thirty-five years from now,
you reprogrammed me...

226
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,440
to be your protector here,
in this time.

227
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,400
Oh, this is deep.

228
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,040
So this other guy, he's
a Terminator like you, right?

229
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:23,160
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.

230
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,560
More advanced than you are?

231
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,320
Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.

232
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,200
What the hell does that mean?

233
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,200
Liquid metal.

234
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,520
Where are we going?

235
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,960
We have to get out of the city
immediately and avoid the authorities.

236
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,760
I gotta stop by my house.
I wanna pick up some stuff.

237
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:46,600
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely
try to reacquire you there.

238
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,480
- You sure?
- I would.

239
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,760
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

240
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,480
but I gotta warn'em.

241
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,960
Shit. You got a quarter?

242
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,720
- Hello.
- Janelle, it's me.

243
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,160
- John?
- ls everything all right?

244
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,680
- Are you guys okay?
- Sure, honey, everything's okay.

245
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,840
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

246
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,520
John, it's late.
I was beginning to worry about you.

247
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,280
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

248
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,880
I'm making beef stew.

249
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,920
Something's wrong.
She's never this nice.

250
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,760
Where are you?

251
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,720
What the hell is
the goddamn dog barking at?

252
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,080
Hey, shut up,
you worthless piece of shit!

253
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,680
The dog's really barking.

254
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,920
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that mutt.

255
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,560
John, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

256
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,320
Could he already be there?

257
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,840
Are you okay?

258
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,920
- I'm right here. I'm fine.
- Are you sure you're all right?

259
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,280
- What's the dog's name?
- Max.

260
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,760
Hey, Janelle.
What's wrong with Wolfie?

261
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,440
I can hear him barking.
ls he okay?

262
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,360
Wolfie's fine, honey.
Wolfie's just fine.

263
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,120
Where are you?

264
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,800
Your foster parents are dead.

265
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,680
I need a minute here.

266
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:08,080
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

267
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,080
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

268
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,600
Get real.

269
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,440
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

270
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,440
No, only an object
of equal size.

271
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,080
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

272
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,200
It can't form complex machines.

273
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,840
Guns and explosives
have chemicals, moving parts.

274
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,280
It doesn't work that way.

275
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,000
- But it can form solid metal shapes.
- Like what?

276
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,160
Knives and stabbing weapons.

277
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,360
These were taken by
a video surveillance camera...

278
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,000
at the West Highland Police Station
in 1984.

279
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,280
He killed 17 police officers
that night.

280
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,800
Men with families...

281
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,800
children.

282
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,760
These were taken at a mall
in Reseda...

283
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,000
today.

284
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,480
Miss Connor, we know you know
who this guy is.

285
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,640
I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing...

286
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,560
that the foster parents
have been murdered.

287
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,320
We know this guy's involved.

288
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,760
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

289
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,120
We're wasting our time.

290
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,320
Let's go.

291
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,960
Sorry, guys.

292
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,280
She's grown more disconnected
from reality as time goes on.

293
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,640
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

294
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,920
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

295
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,560
Sure.

296
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,680
Douglas, take her back to her room.

297
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,840
Yes, sir.

298
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,520
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

299
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,760
You see...

300
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,000
we spent a lot of time in Nicaragua
and places like that.

301
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,600
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy...

302
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,040
running guns.

303
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,080
Then there were some other guys.

304
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,160
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from...

305
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,440
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

306
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,280
Then she gets busted.

307
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,920
It's like, 'Sorry, kid, your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?'

308
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,040
Like everything I've been brought up
to believe is all made-up bullshit.

309
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,760
I hated her for that.

310
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,720
But everything she said was true.

311
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,960
She knew...

312
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,240
and nobody believed her...

313
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,880
not even me.

314
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,720
Listen. We gotta get her
out of there.

315
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,120
Negative. The T-1000's highest
probability for success now...

316
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,280
will be to copy Sarah Connor and wait
for you to make contact with her.

317
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,440
Great. What happens to her?

318
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,400
Typically, the subject being copied
is terminated.

319
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,720
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

320
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,880
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.

321
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,120
Fuck you!
She's a priority to me!

322
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Goddamn it!
What's your problem? Help!

323
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,880
This does not help our mission.

324
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,440
Get this psycho off of me!
Help!

325
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,560
I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

326
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,680
Let me go!

327
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,000
Why did you do that?

328
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,960
Because you told me to.

329
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,240
What?

330
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,280
You have to do what I say?

331
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,600
That's one of my mission parameters.

332
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,360
Prove it.
Stand on one foot.

333
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,920
Yes!

334
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,720
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

335
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,480
You okay, kid?

336
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,920
Take a hike, bozo.

337
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,600
Let's get outta here, man.

338
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,560
Fuck you, you little dipshit!

339
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,760
Dipshit?

340
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,040
Put your leg down.

341
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:15,960
- Did you call moi a dipshit?
- Just trying to help this punk.

342
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,360
Grab this guy.

343
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,200
Get him off of me!

344
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,360
Now who's the dipshit...

345
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,200
you jock douche bag?

346
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,760
Put the gun down now!

347
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,080
- Get outta here!
- Come on. Let's split!

348
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,000
You were gonna kill that guy!

349
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,200
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

350
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,080
Listen to me very carefully, okay?

351
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,480
You're not a Terminator anymore,
all right?

352
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,960
You got that?

353
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,320
You just can't go around
killing people.

354
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,400
Why?

355
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,560
What do you mean, why?
'Cause you can't.

356
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,440
Because you just can't.
Trust me on this.

357
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,960
Look. I'm gonna go get my mom.

358
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,840
I order you to help me.

359
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,840
You have a Sarah Connor here?

360
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,560
You're runnin' kind of late.

361
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,080
They've been in there for an hour.

362
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,560
Hold on a second.
I'll buzz you in.

363
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:07,200
Oh, here come your friends now.

364
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,440
- Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

365
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,480
- How 'bout a beer?
- Yeah, right.

366
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:42,600
- Hey, I got a full house.
- That's good, Louis.

367
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,000
Must be my lucky day.

368
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,280
You're right about number 24.

369
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,320
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

370
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,280
- Same kind?
- Mm-hmm.

371
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,440
You!

372
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,880
You broke my arm.

373
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,720
There are 215 bones
in the human body.

374
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,400
That's one. Now, don't move.

375
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,120
What are you going to do?

376
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,680
Why do we stop now?

377
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,800
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

378
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,440
- Right.
- Swear?

379
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,000
What?

380
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:09,200
Just put up your hand and say,
"I swear I won't kill anyone".

381
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,680
I swear I will not kill anyone.

382
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,760
All right. Let's go.

383
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,360
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00...

384
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,720
Monday through Friday.

385
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,640
What the hell are you doing?

386
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,320
You son of a bitch!
You shot me!

387
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,440
Crazy bastard!

388
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,000
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.

389
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,480
He'll live.

390
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,160
Son of a bitch!

391
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,920
Let's try to remain calm.

392
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,920
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

393
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,040
There's no way, Connor.
Let him go.

394
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,640
- Open the door.
- It ain't gonna happen.

395
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,600
Take it easy, Sarah.

396
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,800
It won't work. You're no killer.
I don't believe you can do it.

397
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,880
You're already dead. Everybody dies.
You know I believe it.

398
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,960
So don't fuck with me!

399
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,720
Open the door!

400
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,240
Back off!

401
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,760
Get back!

402
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,760
I'll pump him full of this shit.
I swear!

403
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,200
Don't move!

404
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,520
Drop the shit!

405
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,440
Do it!

406
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,440
Get in the office.

407
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,600
On the floor, face down.
Not you!

408
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,360
Open the door.

409
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,640
On the floor. Hold it open.

410
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,640
Face the wall!

411
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,440
Get her!

412
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,160
Hurry up! Open the door!
The door's locked!

413
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,120
Let's go! Open it!

414
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,600
- She broke it off.
- Open it!

415
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,280
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it!

416
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,560
Mom, wait!

417
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,400
Come back here!

418
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,680
- Help her!
- Wait here.

419
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,320
- Hurry up!
- He'll kill us all!

420
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,840
Hold her.

421
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,560
He'll kill us all!

422
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,120
Mom, are you okay? Mom!

423
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,000
Come with me
if you want to live.

424
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,600
It's okay, Mom.
He's here to help.

425
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,360
Go.

426
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,240
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

427
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,880
Get down.

428
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,320
Out of the car!

429
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,920
Right now!

430
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,360
Go!

431
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:06,840
I'm out.

432
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,560
- Come on.
- Here.

433
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,200
Reload.

434
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,080
Last one!

435
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,880
Hang on.

436
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,640
Ready!

437
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,240
Here, drive.

438
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,720
There's nobody behind us.

439
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,720
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

440
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,320
Can he see anything?

441
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,760
I see everything.

442
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,240
Cool.

443
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,840
Come here.

444
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,320
I said I was okay.

445
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,240
John, it was stupid of you
to go there.

446
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,520
You have to be smarter
than that.

447
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,160
You were almost killed.

448
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,120
What were you thinking?

449
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,680
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me.

450
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,280
Do you understand?

451
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:02,880
You're too important.

452
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,600
Do you understand?

453
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:09,600
But...

454
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:15,040
I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.

455
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,600
I didn't need your help.

456
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,440
What's wrong with your eyes?

457
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:30,880
Nothing.

458
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,240
So, what's your story?

459
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:54,920
You okay?

460
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,400
Fine.

461
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,520
Say, that's a nice bike.

462
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,760
Watch it, lug nuts.

463
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,680
Listen, do you know
what you're doing?

464
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:39,520
I have detailed files
on human anatomy.

465
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,440
I bet.

466
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:45,520
Makes you a more efficient killer,
right?

467
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,680
Correct.

468
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,720
Does it hurt
when you get shot?

469
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:59,280
I sense injuries.
The data could be called "pain".

470
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,560
John, help me with the light.

471
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,920
- Will these heal up?
- Yes.

472
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,200
Good. If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.

473
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:13,360
How long do you live?
I mean, last. Whatever.

474
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,400
A hundred and twenty years
with my existing power cell.

475
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,400
Can you learn stuff that you
haven't been programmed with...

476
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,880
so you can be...

477
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,840
you know, more human...

478
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,800
and not such a dork
all the time?

479
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:33,000
My CPU is a neural net processor,
a learning computer.

480
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:36,920
The more contact I have with humans,
the more I learn.

481
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,720
Cool.

482
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,160
Are we learning yet?

483
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:27,560
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

484
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,880
Just head south.

485
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,280
Keep it under 65.

486
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:46,280
- We don't want to be pulled over.
- Affirmative.

487
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:52,040
You gotta listen to the way
people talk.

488
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:55,640
You don't say 'affirmative'
or some shit like that.

489
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:58,000
You say, "No problemo".

490
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:02,000
If someone comes off to you
with an attitude, you say, "Eat me".

491
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:06,320
And if you want to shine them on,
it's "Hasta la vista, baby".

492
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,680
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad".

493
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,800
If someone gets upset,
you say, "Chill out".

494
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,320
Or you can do combinations.

495
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,320
Chill out, dick-wad.

496
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,160
That's great.
See? You're getting it.

497
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,960
Want some of my fries?

498
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,920
Need any help?

499
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,640
No.

500
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,560
- I got you!
- No, you didn't!

501
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:08,040
We're not gonna make it,
are we?

502
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,200
People, I mean.

503
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,200
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

504
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,200
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

505
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:23,520
Break it up before I wring
both of your necks.

506
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:28,400
I need to know
how Skynet gets built.

507
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,760
Who's responsible?

508
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:33,360
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

509
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,200
Who is that?

510
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:39,200
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

511
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,720
Why him?

512
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:47,160
In a few months he creates
a revolutionary type of microprocessor.

513
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,560
Go on. Then what?

514
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:53,600
In three years Cyberdyne will become
the largest supplier...

515
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,080
of military computer systems.

516
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:59,080
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers...

517
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,600
becoming fully unmanned.

518
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:03,760
Afterwards they fly with
a perfect operational record.

519
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,480
The Skynet funding bill is passed.

520
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:09,800
The system goes on-line
on August 4, 1997.

521
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:13,080
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defense.

522
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,880
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

523
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:20,240
It becomes self-aware
at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29.

524
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,920
In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.

525
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:27,280
- Skynet fights back.
- Yes.

526
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,120
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

527
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:33,280
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

528
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:35,760
Because Skynet knows
that the Russian counterattack...

529
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,760
will eliminate its enemies
over here.

530
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,760
Jesus.

531
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,000
How much do you know
about Dyson?

532
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,080
I have detailed files.

533
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:51,240
I want to know everything.

534
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:56,520
What he looks like,
where he lives, everything.

535
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,560
Wait in the car.

536
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,480
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

537
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,000
Hey, big John.

538
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,800
What's up?

539
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,320
He's cool, Enrique.

540
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,480
He's with me.

541
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,720
He's... Uncle Bob.

542
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,880
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

543
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,880
Uncle Bob, huh?

544
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,200
Okay.

545
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,160
Drink?

546
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,840
"Uncle Bob"?

547
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,840
You're pretty famous,
all over the goddamn TV.

548
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:06,560
Pictures of you, John,
your big friend here.

549
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,560
Cops are going nuts
looking for you.

550
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:16,520
I just came for my stuff.
I need clothes, food and a truck.

551
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,520
How about the fillings in my teeth?

552
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,720
Now, Enrique.

553
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,280
You two,
you're on weapons detail.

554
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,040
Let's go.

555
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,560
One thing about my mom...

556
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,800
she always plans ahead.

557
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:04,800
Excellent.

558
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:19,040
This is my best truck,
but the starter motor's gone.

559
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,040
You got time to change it out?

560
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:24,480
Yeah. I'm gonna wait 'til dark
to cross the border.

561
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,240
I grew up in places like this...

562
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:31,760
so I thought
that's how people lived...

563
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:35,480
riding around in helicopters,
learning how to blow shit up.

564
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:42,640
That's definitely you.

565
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,880
Most of the guys my mom
hung around with were geeks...

566
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:00,560
but there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.

567
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,560
He taught me engines.

568
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,800
Hold here.

569
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,280
Mom screwed it up, of course.

570
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,800
She'd always tell 'em
about Judgment Day...

571
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:12,680
and me being this world leader.

572
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:14,680
That'd be all she wrote.

573
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,160
Torque wrench, please.

574
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,640
Here.

575
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:23,920
I wish I could've met
my real dad.

576
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,760
You will.

577
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,040
Yeah, I guess.

578
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:31,920
When I'm, like 45, I think.

579
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,760
They sent him back through time
to 1984.

580
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,240
Man.

581
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,200
He hasn't even been born yet.

582
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,960
It messes with your head.

583
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:50,640
- The other bolt.
- Oh. Here.

584
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:00,520
Mom and him were only together
for one night.

585
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,080
She still loves him, I guess.

586
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:06,040
I see her crying sometimes.

587
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:10,560
She denies it totally, of course,
like she got something stuck in her eye.

588
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,600
Why do you cry?

589
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,200
- You mean people?
- Yeah.

590
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,640
I don't know.

591
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,840
We just cry...

592
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,440
you know, when it hurts.

593
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,280
Pain causes it?

594
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,520
No. It's different.

595
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,880
It's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyway.

596
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,560
- You get it?
- No.

597
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,560
All right, my man!

598
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:47,960
Give me five.

599
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,120
Just put out your hand
like this.

600
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:57,800
All right! Now hit me.
Give me five. Do the same thing.

601
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,000
Okay, that's good.
Up high.

602
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,280
Five low.

603
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:08,960
Too slow.

604
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,280
I'm just kidding.
One more time.

605
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,560
Good. Now try it.

606
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,560
Now do me.
Give me five.

607
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:24,600
Watching John with the machine,
it was suddenly so clear.

608
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:27,600
The Terminator would never stop.

609
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:31,640
It would never leave him,
never hurt him...

610
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:35,160
never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him...

611
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,800
or be too busy
to spend time with him.

612
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:40,800
It would always be there...

613
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,520
and it would die
to protect him.

614
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:48,320
Of all the would-be fathers
who came and went over the years...

615
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,400
this thing, this machine...

616
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,840
was the only one
who measured up.

617
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,480
In an insane world...

618
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:57,480
it was the sanest choice.

619
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,200
Hey, let's try this one.

620
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,040
There we go.

621
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,640
She said go south with him
like you planned.

622
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,920
- She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom!

623
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:38,880
Mom, wait!

624
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:55,680
"No fate".

625
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:59,360
No fate but what we make.

626
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,440
My father told her this.

627
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:10,320
I made him memorize it in the future
as a message to her.

628
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,920
Never mind.

629
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,360
Okay, the whole thing goes...

630
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:20,160
The future's not set.

631
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:23,760
There's no fate but what
we make for ourselves.

632
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:26,800
She intends to change the future.

633
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:28,360
Yeah, I guess.

634
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:31,760
Oh, shit!

635
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,760
- Dyson.
- Yeah.

636
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:37,280
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

637
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,400
She's gonna blow him away.

638
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:41,520
Come on! Let's go!

639
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
This is tactically dangerous.

640
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,200
Drive faster.

641
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:59,800
The T-1000 has the same files
that I do.

642
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:03,320
It knows what I know.
It might anticipate this move.

643
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,840
I don't care.
We gotta stop her.

644
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,880
Killing Dyson
might prevent the war.

645
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,160
I don't care!

646
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,160
Haven't you learned anything yet?

647
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:14,720
Haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?

648
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:23,360
Danny, I told you to go to bed.
I'm not kidding.

649
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,720
Just a couple of minutes, Mom!

650
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:37,280
Danny, your time is up!

651
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:40,280
Come brush your teeth
and get to bed.

652
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,440
Danny!

653
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,440
Daddy!

654
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,960
Danny, go! Go!

655
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,760
Miles?

656
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,400
- Tortsia, run!
- Oh, my God!

657
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:45,480
Just take Danny and run!

658
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:46,880
Run!

659
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,680
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

660
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:08,600
Daddy!

661
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,760
Nobody fucking move!

662
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:13,840
Don't hurt my daddy!

663
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,440
On the floor, bitch.

664
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,720
Get down now!

665
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:19,680
Move!

666
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,200
Don't hurt him!

667
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:24,680
Get on the floor now!

668
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,520
Just let the boy go.

669
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,160
Shut up. Shut up.

670
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:32,520
Shut up!

671
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,200
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

672
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,560
- It's all your fault!
- What?

673
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,720
I'm not gonna let you do it.

674
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,880
Shit! We're too late!

675
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,440
Check them.

676
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,120
Look at me, Mom.

677
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,400
Are you hurt?

678
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,080
I almost...

679
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:07,120
It'll be okay.

680
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,120
We'll figure something out.
Okay?

681
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:12,400
I promise.

682
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:18,600
You came here to stop me.

683
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,440
Yeah, I did.

684
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,320
I love you, John.

685
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,560
I always have.

686
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:32,920
I know.

687
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:42,120
Deep penetration.

688
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,680
No shattered bone.

689
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:48,680
Hold here.
The pressure should stop the bleeding.

690
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:00,840
Who are you people?

691
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,240
Show him.

692
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:10,120
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Show me your room.

693
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:51,840
Oh, my God.

694
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,560
Now listen to me
very carefully.

695
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:04,600
Dyson listened while the Terminator
laid it all down.

696
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:08,520
Skynet. Judgment Day.

697
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,880
The history of things to come.

698
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:15,080
It's not every day that
you find out you're responsible...

699
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:18,000
for three billion deaths.

700
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,000
He took it pretty well.

701
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,440
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

702
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,600
You're judging me...

703
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:35,120
on things I haven't even done yet.

704
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,440
How were we supposed to know?

705
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,880
Yeah.

706
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:48,360
Right.

707
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:50,560
How were you supposed to know?

708
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,480
Fucking men like you...

709
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,320
built the hydrogen bomb.

710
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:58,000
Men like you...

711
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,520
thought it up.

712
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:05,320
You think you're so creative.

713
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:09,840
You don't know what it's like
to really create something...

714
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,080
to create a life...

715
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,640
to feel it growing inside you.

716
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:16,680
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

717
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,440
Mom!

718
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:22,280
We need to be a little more
constructive here. Okay?

719
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:24,440
We still have to stop this
from happening.

720
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:27,360
But I thought...

721
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:31,400
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

722
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:36,360
That's right. There's no way I'm going
to finish the new processor. Not now.

723
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:39,840
Forget it. I'm out of it.
I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.

724
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,840
That's not good enough.

725
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:43,840
No one must follow your work.

726
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,800
Right.

727
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:50,240
All right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab...

728
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:51,840
the files, the disk drives...

729
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:54,640
everything here.

730
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:56,760
Everything.

731
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:58,760
I don't care.

732
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:01,040
The chip.

733
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:03,200
- Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

734
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:05,720
It's at Cyberdyne.
It's from the other one like you.

735
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,560
The CPU from the first Terminator.

736
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:11,000
Son of a bitch!
I knew it!

737
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:13,800
They told us not to ask
where they got it.

738
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:16,200
Those lying motherfuckers.

739
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:18,080
It's scary stuff.
Radically advanced.

740
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:19,320
It was smashed.

741
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:23,040
It didn't work, but it gave us ideas,
took us in new directions.

742
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:25,040
Things we would've never...

743
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,320
All my work was based on it.

744
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,240
It must be destroyed.

745
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:36,520
Can you get us in?
Past security?

746
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,640
I think so, yeah. When?

747
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:44,680
Now?

748
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:51,560
The future,
always so clear to me...

749
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:54,640
had become like
a black highway at night.

750
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:57,440
We were in
uncharted territory now...

751
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:00,480
making up history
as we went along.

752
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:40,720
Carl, right?

753
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:45,480
Friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd...

754
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,520
take 'em upstairs
and show 'em around.

755
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:50,960
Mr. Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

756
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,160
I need written authorization...

757
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,200
I insist.

758
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,080
Don't even think about it.

759
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,480
It's okay.

760
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:15,040
It takes two keys, turned
simultaneously, to open the vault.

761
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:18,040
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

762
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:20,800
Gibbons?

763
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:25,720
Gibbons! Come on, man!

764
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:28,880
You can't leave the desk
like that!

765
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:35,200
Oh, shit.

766
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:54,760
My card should access this.

767
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,880
- What is it?
- Damn it.

768
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:03,920
The silent alarm's been tripped.

769
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:12,840
It's neutralized all the codes
in the entire building.

770
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:14,840
Nothing will open anywhere now.

771
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:17,760
We have to abort.

772
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:24,360
We go all the way.
Okay?

773
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:30,360
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

774
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:32,840
- I think it's that guy from the mall.
- It is.

775
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:34,840
It's him and the woman.

776
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:39,600
Just send everything
you got in the area right now.

777
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:45,240
I have a personal entry code
for the lab. It may still work.

778
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:50,880
It's no good.

779
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:52,400
Let me try mine.

780
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,520
John, fire in the hole!

781
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:16,400
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the Halon system.

782
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:26,000
You have to wait
until the gas clears.

783
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:29,760
Put this on.

784
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:46,240
All right, let's get to work.

785
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:10,760
All units in the vicinity
and all units able to respond...

786
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:15,640
a 211 in progress, 2144 Kramer Street,
the Cyberdyne building.

787
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,400
Suspect one is white female...

788
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:20,880
identified as last name Connor,
first name Sarah.

789
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,920
Escaped last night
from Pescadero State Hospital.

790
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,520
Suspect two: White male fitting
description of the individual...

791
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:31,080
wanted for the murder
of police officers in 1984.

792
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,080
Suspects are armed
and considered extremely...

793
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:27,200
All right.

794
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:29,040
7-2-5-6.

795
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:37,360
Easy money.

796
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:43,560
Uh-oh.

797
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,760
Oh, shit. Not good.

798
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,440
How we doing?

799
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,200
Primer cord is set.

800
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:59,720
One more barrel,
two more minutes.

801
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:06,560
- How do we set them off?
- Remote control.

802
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:09,040
Piece of cake.

803
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:10,600
- We got company.
- Police?

804
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:14,080
- How many?
- All of 'em, I think.

805
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:15,520
Go. I'll finish here.

806
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,920
Come on.

807
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,960
I'll take care of the police.

808
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,320
Wait! You swore!

809
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:27,720
Trust me.

810
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,640
You at the window!

811
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:46,120
Drop your weapon and place your hands
on top of your head!

812
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:49,320
Holy shit!

813
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:50,920
That's a mini-gun!

814
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:15,520
- Come on!
- Oh, shit!

815
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,120
Go! Go! Go!

816
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:06,160
Fire!

817
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,200
Same time, to the left.

818
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:27,600
One, two, three, go.

819
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:42,600
In order to get that out...

820
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:52,120
We got Skynet by the balls now.

821
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:53,880
Come on, let's book.

822
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:56,520
Hold your fire!

823
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
- Ready to rock?
- Ready.

824
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:28,960
Time to go.

825
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:30,480
Now.

826
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:33,520
- Take this. They'll use gas.
- Come on.

827
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:36,720
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

828
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:03,720
Mom! Mom!

829
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:49,160
Shit!

830
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:53,600
She's in the clean room.
There's no way outta there.

831
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:04,040
Get down!

832
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:13,000
Here.

833
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:41,960
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

834
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:47,600
Fall back!

835
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:49,280
Everybody out!

836
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:51,280
Fall back now!
Go! Go! Go!

837
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:28,640
We got a war zone here!

838
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:02,280
Shut your eyes.

839
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:12,040
Stay here. I'll be back.

840
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:22,200
Get down on the floor!
Face down!

841
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:26,440
On the floor now!

842
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:30,320
Okay, drop him!

843
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:51,640
Here, hold this.

844
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:10,000
Holy shit!

845
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:26,040
Go!

846
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:05,800
Shit!

847
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,160
Get out.

848
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:41,560
Listen.

849
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:44,320
No matter what happens,
stay under these vests.

850
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:45,680
- You got it?
- Yeah.

851
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:47,200
All right.

852
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:03,000
Chopper's coming in!

853
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:04,160
It's him.

854
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:03,360
Shit!

855
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:08,000
Stay down!

856
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:24,040
Goddamn!

857
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:24,680
You okay...

858
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:34,680
Come on, Mom,
we gotta get out.

859
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:38,200
Take the shotgun.

860
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:42,960
Are you hurt?

861
01:49:56,240 --> 01:49:57,160
Holy shit.

862
01:49:57,240 --> 01:49:59,160
Come on, Mom. Come on!

863
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:00,360
We need your truck.

864
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:01,880
Hurry!

865
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:09,440
- Come on. Hurry.
- Get in.

866
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:19,600
Go!

867
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:21,640
What the hell...

868
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:30,320
- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

869
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,640
Here. This'll work.

870
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:40,880
He's gaining.

871
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:45,160
Step on it!

872
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:48,040
- This is the vehicle's top speed.
- I can run faster than this!

873
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:00,320
Coming up, to the right.

874
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,320
Watch it! Watch it!

875
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:29,000
- Drive.
- Where are you going?

876
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:38,440
Take the off-ramp.

877
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:49,280
Shit!

878
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:53,440
Hold on!

879
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:40,960
Don't stop!

880
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:50,200
Go straight!

881
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:53,600
Look out!

882
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:54,480
Duck!

883
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:11,200
Get the hell outta here!

884
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:19,800
Get outta here!
Let's go! Come on!

885
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:39,280
Hasta la vista, baby.

886
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:30,240
We don't have much time.

887
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:54,160
Let's go.

888
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:56,960
We gotta get outta here.

889
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,080
Come on! Get up!

890
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:14,440
Hand me the shotgun.

891
01:56:19,240 --> 01:56:21,520
Put your weight on me, Mom.

892
01:56:22,360 --> 01:56:24,240
Hurry!

893
01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:29,400
Come on, Mom.

894
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:37,240
Get up!

895
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:55,200
This way. Come on.

896
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:09,200
Wait! No. No. It's too hot.

897
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:10,520
Go back.

898
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:21,000
- Go. Run.
- No! We gotta stick together.

899
01:57:21,080 --> 01:57:23,040
John, you've got to go now.

900
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:25,320
- John!
- Go! Now!

901
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:41,560
Get up the steps.

902
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:44,960
Go.

903
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:50,400
Get up.

904
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:53,280
Come on, Mom.
I got you.

905
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:30,120
Grab the chain. Grab it.

906
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:34,200
Grab it. Go. Go!

907
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:47,840
Mom, come on! Mom!

908
02:00:37,040 --> 02:00:38,840
Call to John.

909
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:43,480
I know this hurts.

910
02:00:45,320 --> 02:00:46,920
Call John.

911
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:05,960
Call to John now.

912
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:09,920
Fuck you.

913
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:28,920
Help!

914
02:04:49,480 --> 02:04:51,040
Mom.

915
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:54,720
Help me.

916
02:04:57,360 --> 02:04:58,640
Get out of the way, John.

917
02:04:58,680 --> 02:04:59,640
Shoot!

918
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:56,920
Get down!

919
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:32,360
Get up. Come on.

920
02:07:34,640 --> 02:07:36,440
Holy shit.

921
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:38,960
I need a vacation.

922
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:55,000
Is it dead?

923
02:07:55,080 --> 02:07:56,520
Terminated.

924
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:01,640
Will this melt in there?

925
02:08:04,600 --> 02:08:06,480
Yes. Throw it in.

926
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:15,520
And the chip.

927
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:32,280
It's over.

928
02:08:39,160 --> 02:08:40,800
There's one more chip.

929
02:08:45,480 --> 02:08:47,760
And it must be destroyed also.

930
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:54,760
Here.

931
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:58,280
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

932
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:13,880
I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.

933
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:16,200
No, it'll be okay.
Stay with us.

934
02:09:16,280 --> 02:09:18,280
- It'll be okay.
- I have to go away.

935
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:20,960
No, don't do it.
Please, don't go.

936
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:24,080
I must go away, John.

937
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:25,640
No, wait.

938
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:27,240
You don't have to do this.

939
02:09:27,320 --> 02:09:28,680
I'm sorry.

940
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:31,880
No, don't do it! Don't go!

941
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:33,880
It has to end here.

942
02:09:35,120 --> 02:09:38,360
I order you not to go!

943
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:48,360
I know now why you cry.

944
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:53,240
But it's something
I can never do.

945
02:10:27,560 --> 02:10:29,720
Good-bye.

946
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:11,840
The unknown future
rolls toward us.

947
02:12:11,960 --> 02:12:15,880
I face it for the first time
with a sense of hope.

948
02:12:15,960 --> 02:12:18,320
Because if a machine,
a Terminator...

949
02:12:18,400 --> 02:12:21,800
can learn the value
of human life...

950
02:12:21,880 --> 02:12:24,320
maybe we can too.
