1
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:24,210
<i>Three billion human lives ended
on August 29, 1997.</i>

2
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:26,420
<i>The survivors of the nuclear fire...</i>

3
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:29,215
<i>called the war "Judgment Day."</i>

4
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:32,384
<i>They lived only to face
a new nightmare...</i>

5
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:34,512
<i>the war against the machines.</i>

6
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:56,427
<i>The computer which controlled
the machines, Skynet...</i>

7
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,513
<i>sent two Terminators
back through time.</i>

8
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:03,643
<i>Their mission: to destroy the leader
of the human resistance.</i>

9
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:06,562
<i>John Connor, my son.</i>

10
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:14,862
<i>The first Terminator was programmed
to strike at me in the year 1984...</i>

11
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,281
<i>before John was born.</i>

12
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,199
<i>It failed.</i>

13
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:22,119
<i>The second was set to strike
at John himself...</i>

14
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:24,664
<i>when he was still a child.</i>

15
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:32,088
<i>As before, the resistance was able
to send a lone warrior...</i>

16
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:34,465
<i>a protector for John.</i>

17
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,968
<i>It was just a question of which one
of them would reach him first.</i>

18
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:56,101
I need your clothes, your boots
and your motorcycle.

19
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,071
You forgot to say please.

20
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,130
Get him off me!

21
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,235
Pull it out!

22
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,966
Take it.

23
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,412
Can't let you take
the man's wheels, son.

24
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,999
Now, get off
before I put you down.

25
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,301
That's it, goddamn it.

26
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:56,115
R-31 David, Sherman Code 6...

27
00:10:56,198 --> 00:11:00,911
at the Sixth Street Bridge and Santa Fe
on electrical disturbance.

28
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,246
<i>Ten-four, R-31 David.</i>

29
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:43,096
John, get in there and clean up
that pigsty of yours.

30
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,068
Your foster parents
are kind of dicks, huh?

31
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:00,238
I swear, I have had it
with that goddamn kid.

32
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,950
- He won't even answer me anymore.
- Honey, move.

33
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,953
Would you get off your butt
and help me?

34
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,872
- Todd!
- What?

35
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,292
He hasn't cleaned that room of his
in a month.

36
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,545
Oh, it's an emergency.
Hang on. I'll get right on it.

37
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,471
Come on.

38
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:28,600
Get your ass inside.
Do what your mother tells you.

39
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,562
She's not my mother, Todd.

40
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,757
<i>This next patient is interesting.</i>

41
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,302
I've been following the case
for years.

42
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,470
A 29-year-old female...

43
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:10,475
diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

44
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,812
The usual indicators: depression,
anxiety, violent acting out...

45
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,605
delusions of persecution.

46
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:25,406
<i>The delusional architecture
is fairly unique.</i>

47
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,326
She believes that a machine
called the Terminator...

48
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,747
which looks human,
was sent back through time...

49
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,874
- to kill her.
- That's original.

50
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:37,210
And also that the father
of her child...

51
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:40,547
was a soldier sent back
to protect her.

52
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,549
He was from the future too.

53
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:47,262
The year 2029,
if I remember correctly.

54
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,597
And here we are.

55
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,474
<i>Morning, Sarah.</i>

56
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:59,774
Good morning, Dr. Silberman.
How's the knee?

57
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,529
<i>Fine, Sarah.</i>

58
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,906
She stabbed me in the kneecap...

59
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,535
with my pen a few weeks ago.

60
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,121
Repeated escape attempts.

61
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,633
Let's move on, shall we?

62
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:28,053
I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.

63
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:31,514
- See she takes her Thorazine.
- Sure. I'll take care of it.

64
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:47,321
It's time to take your meds, Connor.

65
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,157
You take it.

66
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,577
Now you know you gotta be good.
You're up for review this afternoon.

67
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:54,579
I'm not taking it, Dougie.

68
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:57,707
- I don't want any trouble.
- Ain't no trouble.

69
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,048
Zap her.

70
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,644
Last call, sugar.

71
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,652
Sweet dreams.

72
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,267
Are you the legal guardian
of John Connor?

73
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:01,021
That's right, Officer.
What's he done now?

74
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:04,065
- Could I speak with him, please?
- You could if he were here.

75
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:07,027
He took off on his bike this morning.
He could be anywhere.

76
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,404
Do you have a photograph of John?

77
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,738
Yeah. Hold on.

78
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,910
Gonna tell me what this is about?

79
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,580
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

80
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:23,543
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?

81
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:27,130
No, go on. There was a guy here
this morning looking for him too.

82
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,382
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.

83
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,926
Has that got something
to do with this?

84
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,349
I wouldn't worry about him.

85
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:41,227
Thanks for your cooperation.

86
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,273
Please insert your stolen card now.

87
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,282
PIN number.

88
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,076
Hurry up. This is taking too long.

89
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,662
Go, baby.

90
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,706
All right.

91
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,502
- PIN number 9003.
- Where'd you learn this stuff from?

92
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,088
From my mom.
My real mom, I mean.

93
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:12,425
Withdraw 300 bucks.

94
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:15,262
Come on, baby. Come on!

95
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,597
- Yes!
- Hey, it worked.

96
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,351
All right. Easy money.
Come on!

97
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,980
Yes! Piece of cake.

98
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:34,364
- Is that her?
- Yes.

99
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,282
She's pretty cool, huh?

100
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,618
No, she's a complete psycho.

101
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,454
That's why she's at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute.

102
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:46,209
She tried to blow up a computer factory
but got shot and arrested.

103
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,377
No shit.

104
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:51,464
She's a total loser.

105
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:54,301
Come on.
Let's go spend some money.

106
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,290
Sarah, wake up.

107
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,090
Kyle.

108
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,136
You're dead.

109
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,263
Where's our son, Sarah?

110
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:43,516
They took him away from me.

111
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,811
- He's the target now.
- I know.

112
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,938
He's all alone.
You have to protect him.

113
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,483
I know.

114
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:54,152
You tell me
how I'm supposed to do that.

115
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:56,362
He doesn't even believe me anymore.

116
00:19:56,446 --> 00:20:00,492
- I've lost him.
- You're strong, Sarah.

117
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:02,994
Stronger than you ever thought
you could be.

118
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,455
On your feet, soldier!

119
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:10,376
I love you, Sarah.
I always will.

120
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,590
- I need you.
- I'll always be with you.

121
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:22,973
Remember the message?

122
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,849
The future is not set.

123
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:29,604
There is no fate
but what we make for ourselves.

124
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,501
Stay with me.

125
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,338
There's not much time left
in the world, Sarah.

126
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:04,639
Kyle, don't go!

127
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:34,270
<i>It's like a giant strobe light...</i>

128
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,689
<i>burning right through my eyes.</i>

129
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,196
<i>Somehow I can still see.</i>

130
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:50,996
<i>Oh, God.</i>

131
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:57,794
<i>We know the dream's the same
every night.</i>

132
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:01,297
<i>- Why do I have to...
- Please continue.</i>

133
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,720
<i>Children look like burnt paper.</i>

134
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:11,474
<i>Black.</i>

135
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,476
<i>Not moving.</i>

136
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,730
<i>And then the blast wave hits them.</i>

137
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,742
<i>And they fly apart like leaves.</i>

138
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:34,872
<i>Dreams of cataclysm,
the end of the world...</i>

139
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:36,875
<i>are very common.</i>

140
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:42,838
<i>It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.</i>

141
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:46,843
<i>- I know the date it happens.
- I'm sure it feels real to you.</i>

142
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,429
<i>On August 29, 1997...</i>

143
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:53,016
<i>it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin' real to you too!</i>

144
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,769
<i>Anybody not wearing two-million
sunblock is gonna have a real bad day.</i>

145
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:58,772
<i>Get it?</i>

146
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:01,733
<i>God, you think
you're safe and alive.</i>

147
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:04,110
<i>You're already dead. Everybody!</i>

148
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,696
<i>Him. You. You're dead already.</i>

149
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,657
<i>This whole place,
everything you see is gone!</i>

150
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,827
<i>You're the one living in the dream,
'cause I know it happens!</i>

151
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,871
<i>It happens!</i>

152
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:29,844
I feel much better now.

153
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,804
Clearer.

154
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:34,682
Yes, your attitude has been...

155
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:37,059
much improved lately.

156
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,905
It's helped me to have a goal...

157
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:52,158
something to look forward to.

158
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,409
What is that?

159
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,828
Well, you said...

160
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:59,749
that if I showed improvement
after six months...

161
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,501
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing...

162
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:05,338
and I could have visitors.

163
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:11,010
Well, it's been six months and...

164
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,430
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

165
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:16,933
I see.

166
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:24,357
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

167
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,902
Now you think they don't exist?

168
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:33,115
They don't exist.
I know that now.

169
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:36,369
But you've told me on many occasions
about how you crushed one...

170
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,537
in a hydraulic press.

171
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:43,042
If I had, there would have
been some evidence.

172
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,544
They would have found something
at the factory.

173
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:47,713
I see.

174
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:51,217
<i>So you don't believe anymore
that the company covered it up?</i>

175
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:56,389
<i>No. Why would they?</i>

176
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:59,725
Let's try a new position
right there.

177
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:11,154
Mr. Dyson?

178
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,658
The materials team
is running another...

179
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,409
- Mr. Dyson.
- Yes?

180
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,454
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

181
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:23,499
You have to sign for the... it.

182
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,418
- You have to sign it out.
- Okay. I'll get it.

183
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,425
I know I haven't been here long,
but I was wondering if you know...

184
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:33,884
Know what?

185
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:36,596
If you know where "it" came from.

186
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:40,099
I asked them the same question once.
You know what they told me?

187
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,142
Don't ask.

188
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:51,110
- Good morning, Mr. Dyson.
- How's it going?

189
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:54,113
Insert key. Left on three.

190
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,532
Two, one, turn.

191
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,872
- How are the wife and kids?
- Great. Thanks.

192
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:33,110
So what do you think, Doctor?

193
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,946
Haven't I shown improvement?

194
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:39,992
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

195
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,496
I know how smart you are.

196
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,623
You're just telling me
what I want to hear.

197
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,710
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

198
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:53,715
If I put you in minimum security,
you'll just try to escape again.

199
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,846
You have to let me see my son.

200
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:03,683
Please.

201
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:10,856
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

202
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,734
If I could make a phone call...

203
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:16,278
I'm afraid not.
Not for a while.

204
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,950
I don't see any choice but to
recommend to the review board...

205
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,619
that you stay here
for another six months.

206
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:30,084
I'll kill you,
you son of a bitch!

207
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:33,796
You son of a bitch!

208
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:38,425
Ten CCs of sodium amobarbital, stat!

209
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:41,428
- You don't know what you're doing!
- Get some restraints in here now!

210
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:46,976
You don't know what you're doing!

211
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:53,107
<i>Model citizen.</i>

212
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:34,857
You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

213
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,110
- He was going to the galleria.
- Yeah.

214
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:39,987
The galleria?

215
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:28,410
I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right?

216
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,136
- Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?

217
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,643
Hey, do you know this guy?

218
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,895
Nah, I don't know him.

219
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:02,611
- John.
- Not now.

220
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:05,948
There's this cop scoping for you.
Check it out.

221
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:10,411
- He's right over there.
- Split, man.

222
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,955
- Just go.
- Yeah.

223
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:18,919
I saw that kid...

224
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:36,186
You're not supposed to
be in here!

225
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,130
Get down.

226
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,078
Mister, are you all right?

227
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:18,414
You all right?

228
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,930
Come on!

229
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,263
Goddamn!

230
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:58,086
Okay, time-out.
Stop the bike.

231
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,756
Time-out.
Come on, stop the bike.

232
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,563
Holy shit.
Now, don't take this the wrong way.

233
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:19,024
- You are a Terminator, right?
- Yes.

234
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:21,943
Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.

235
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,457
Holy shit.

236
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,544
You're really real.

237
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:41,588
I mean...

238
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,051
You're like a machine underneath,
right?

239
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,637
But alive outside?

240
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,639
I'm a cybernetic organism.

241
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,433
Living tissue
over metal endoskeleton.

242
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,409
This is intense.

243
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:13,286
Get a grip, John. Okay.

244
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,999
You're not here to kill me.

245
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:22,045
I figured that part out for myself.
So what's the deal?

246
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:27,551
- My mission is to protect you.
- Yeah? Who sent you?

247
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,887
You did.
Thirty-five years from now...

248
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:34,975
you reprogrammed me to be
your protector here in this time.

249
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:37,811
Oh, this is deep.

250
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,253
So this other guy,
he's a Terminator like you, right?

251
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:07,049
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.

252
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,468
More advanced than you are?

253
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:15,057
- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.
- What the hell does that mean?

254
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:19,394
- Liquid metal.
- Where are we going?

255
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,814
We have to get out of the city
immediately and avoid the authorities.

256
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,609
I gotta stop by my house.
I wanna pick up some stuff.

257
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:30,488
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely
try to reacquire you there.

258
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:33,325
- You sure?
- I would.

259
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,587
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

260
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:50,342
but I gotta warn 'em.

261
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,802
Shit. You got a quarter?

262
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:04,564
- Hello.
<i>- Janelle, it's me.</i>

263
00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:07,025
- John?
<i>- Is everything all right?</i>

264
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,527
- Are you guys okay?
<i>- Sure, honey, everything's okay.</i>

265
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:12,697
- Are you all right?
<i>- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

266
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:16,368
John, it's late.
I was beginning to worry about you.

267
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:19,162
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

268
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,788
I'm making beef stew.

269
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,792
Somethings wrong.
She's never this nice.

270
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,668
Where are you?

271
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,630
What the hell is
the goddamn dog barking at?

272
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:31,966
Hey, shut up,
you worthless piece of shit!

273
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,510
The dog's really barking.

274
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,804
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that mutt.

275
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,477
John, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

276
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,270
Could he already be there?

277
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:46,690
Are you okay?

278
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:50,777
- I'm right here. I'm fine.
<i>- Are you sure you're all right?</i>

279
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:54,197
- What's the dog's name?
- Max.

280
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,616
Hey, Janelle.
What's wrong with Wolfie?

281
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,285
I can hear him barking.
Is he okay?

282
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:03,248
Wolfie's fine, honey.
Wolfie's just fine.

283
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,999
Where are you?

284
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,669
Your foster parents are dead.

285
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,542
I need a minute here.

286
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:51,963
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

287
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,966
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

288
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,467
Get real.

289
00:43:56,551 --> 00:44:00,305
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

290
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,307
No, only an object
of equal size.

291
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,767
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

292
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:07,061
It can't form complex machines.

293
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:09,189
Guns and explosives
have chemicals, moving parts.

294
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:12,901
It doesn't work that way.
But it can form solid metal shapes.

295
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:16,029
- Like what?
- Knives and stabbing weapons.

296
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:57,589
Messages from Mom.

297
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,690
These were taken by
a video surveillance camera...

298
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:19,318
at the West Highland Police Station
in 1984.

299
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:22,822
He killed 17 police officers
that night.

300
00:46:25,158 --> 00:46:27,202
Men with families...

301
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,204
children.

302
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:34,208
These were taken at a mall
in Reseda...

303
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,503
today.

304
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,882
Miss Connor, we know you know
who this guy is.

305
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:48,056
I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing...

306
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:50,975
that the foster parents
have been murdered.

307
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:52,810
We know this guy's involved.

308
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:57,190
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

309
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:05,740
We're wasting our time.
Let's go.

310
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,367
Sorry, guys.

311
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:12,747
She's grown more disconnected
from reality as time goes on.

312
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,041
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

313
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:18,336
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

314
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,046
Sure.

315
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:23,091
Douglas, take her back to her room.

316
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:24,342
Yes, sir.

317
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:28,012
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

318
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:30,140
You see...

319
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:33,435
we spent a lot of time in Nicaragua
and places like that.

320
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:39,024
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy...

321
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:40,483
running guns.

322
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:43,486
Then there were some other guys.

323
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,571
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from...

324
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:48,908
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

325
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,662
Then she gets busted.

326
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:56,374
It's like, "Sorry, kid, your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?"

327
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:02,505
Like everything I've been brought up
to believe is all made-up bullshit.

328
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,423
I hated her for that.

329
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:11,139
But everything she said was true.

330
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:14,392
She knew...

331
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:18,646
and nobody believed her...

332
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:22,317
not even me.

333
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:26,154
Listen. We gotta get her
out of there.

334
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:29,615
Negative. The T-1000's highest
probability for success now...

335
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:32,744
will be to copy Sarah Connor and wait
for you to make contact with her.

336
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,912
Great. What happens to her?

337
00:48:34,996 --> 00:48:37,874
Typically, the subject being copied
is terminated.

338
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:41,210
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

339
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:43,379
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.

340
00:48:43,463 --> 00:48:45,631
Fuck you!
She's a priority to me!

341
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:51,471
Goddamn it!
What's your problem? Help!

342
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:53,347
This does not help our mission.

343
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:55,892
Get this psycho off of me!
Help!

344
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:59,020
I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

345
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:00,146
Let me go!

346
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:06,485
Why did you do that?

347
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,488
Because you told me to.

348
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:12,742
What?

349
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:19,749
You have to do what I say?

350
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:22,043
That's one of my mission parameters.

351
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:26,464
Prove it.
Stand on one foot.

352
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:30,385
Yes!

353
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:36,182
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

354
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:38,934
You okay, kid?

355
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:40,394
Take a hike, bozo.

356
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:43,064
Let's get outta here, man.

357
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:45,024
Fuck you, you little dipshit!

358
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:47,235
Dipshit?

359
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,530
Put your leg down.

360
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:56,452
- Did you call <i>moi</i> a dipshit?
- Just trying to help this punk.

361
00:49:56,536 --> 00:49:58,872
Grab this guy.

362
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:01,666
Get him off of me!

363
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,834
Now who's the dipshit...

364
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,711
you jock douche bag?

365
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:17,265
Put the gun down now!

366
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:20,560
- Get outta here!
- Come on. Let's split!

367
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,443
You were gonna kill that guy!

368
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,696
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

369
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:36,534
Listen to me very carefully, okay?

370
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:39,954
You're not a Terminator anymore,
all right?

371
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,456
You got that?

372
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,792
You just can't go around
killing people.

373
00:50:44,876 --> 00:50:45,919
Why?

374
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:49,046
What do you mean, why?
'Cause you can't.

375
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:52,925
Because you just can't.
Trust me on this.

376
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:02,435
Look. I'm gonna go get my mom.

377
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:05,354
I order you to help me.

378
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,337
You have a Sarah Connor here?

379
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:37,089
You're runnin' kind of late.

380
00:53:37,173 --> 00:53:39,550
They've been in there for an hour.

381
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:42,053
Hold on a second.
I'll buzz you in.

382
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:47,767
Oh, here come your friends now.

383
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:52,915
- Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

384
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:56,043
- How 'bout a beer?
- Yeah, right.

385
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:23,154
- Hey, I got a full house.
- That's good, Louis.

386
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:25,489
Must be my lucky day.

387
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,801
You're right about number 24.

388
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,887
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

389
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,849
- Same kind?
- Mm-hmm.

390
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:13,991
You!

391
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,412
You broke my arm.

392
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,289
There are 215 bones
in the human body.

393
00:58:21,373 --> 00:58:23,959
That's one. Now, don't move.

394
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,633
What are you going to do?

395
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:37,222
Why do we stop now?

396
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:42,311
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

397
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:44,980
- Right.
- Swear?

398
00:58:45,064 --> 00:58:46,566
What?

399
00:58:46,649 --> 00:58:49,735
Just put up your hand and say,
"I swear I won't kill anyone."

400
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:53,656
I swear I will not kill anyone.

401
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:54,907
All right. Let's go.

402
00:59:01,914 --> 00:59:03,916
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00...

403
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:06,251
Monday through Friday.

404
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,173
What are you doing?

405
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,884
You son of a bitch!
You shot me!

406
00:59:15,678 --> 00:59:16,971
Crazy bastard!

407
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,560
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.

408
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:29,066
He'll live.

409
00:59:43,539 --> 00:59:45,666
Son of a bitch!

410
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:48,460
Let's try to remain calm.

411
00:59:48,544 --> 00:59:50,462
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

412
00:59:50,546 --> 00:59:52,590
There's no way, Connor.
Let him go.

413
00:59:52,673 --> 00:59:55,217
- Open the door.
- It ain't gonna happen.

414
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,135
Take it easy, Sarah.

415
00:59:57,219 --> 01:00:00,347
It won't work. You're no killer.
I don't believe you can do it.

416
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:03,392
You're already dead. Everybody dies.
You know I believe it.

417
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:05,519
So don't fuck with me!

418
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,312
Open the door!

419
01:00:14,153 --> 01:00:15,780
Back off!

420
01:00:15,863 --> 01:00:17,281
Get back!

421
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:19,324
I'll pump him full of this shit.
I swear!

422
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:22,703
Don't move!

423
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:25,039
Drop the shit!

424
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:26,999
Do it!

425
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:29,001
Get in the office.

426
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:31,128
On the floor, face down.
Not you!

427
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:32,879
Open the door.

428
01:00:35,758 --> 01:00:39,178
On the floor. Hold it open.
Face the wall!

429
01:00:55,194 --> 01:00:57,029
Get her!

430
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:27,726
Hurry up! Open the door!
The door's locked!

431
01:01:28,811 --> 01:01:30,688
Let's go! Open it!

432
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:35,108
- She broke it off.
- Open it!

433
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:42,867
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it!

434
01:02:15,023 --> 01:02:16,107
Mom, wait!

435
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:23,949
Come back here!

436
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:30,206
- Help her!
- Wait here.

437
01:02:30,289 --> 01:02:32,875
- Hurry up!
- He'll kill us all!

438
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,418
Hold her.

439
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:38,130
He'll kill us all!

440
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:02,655
Mom, are you okay? Mom!

441
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:09,536
Come with me
if you want to live.

442
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:12,164
It's okay, Mom.
He's here to help.

443
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:37,898
Go.

444
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,766
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

445
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,407
Get down.

446
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,903
Out of the car!

447
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,448
Right now!

448
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:34,973
Go!

449
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:47,444
I'm out.

450
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:56,161
- Come on.
- Here.

451
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:00,790
Reload.

452
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:11,676
Last one!

453
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:20,477
Hang on.

454
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,213
Ready!

455
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:03,854
Here, drive.

456
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,284
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

457
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:01,453
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

458
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:04,956
Can you see anything?

459
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:07,459
I see everything.

460
01:08:10,337 --> 01:08:11,964
Cool.

461
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:17,427
Come here.

462
01:08:23,225 --> 01:08:24,977
I said I was okay.

463
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:28,939
John, it was stupid of you
to go there.

464
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:32,150
You have to be smarter
than that.

465
01:08:32,234 --> 01:08:33,819
You were almost killed.

466
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:36,821
What were you thinking?

467
01:08:37,656 --> 01:08:40,242
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me.

468
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:43,536
Do you understand?
You're too important.

469
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,289
Do you understand?

470
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:50,293
But...

471
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:55,674
I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.

472
01:08:56,925 --> 01:08:59,302
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.

473
01:09:06,518 --> 01:09:08,144
What's wrong with your eyes?

474
01:09:10,105 --> 01:09:11,523
Nothing.

475
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:23,910
So, what's your story?

476
01:09:34,462 --> 01:09:35,546
You okay?

477
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,048
Fine.

478
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:42,220
Say, that's a nice bike.

479
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:06,411
Watch it, lug nuts.

480
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:17,338
Listen, do you know
what you're doing?

481
01:10:17,422 --> 01:10:20,216
I have detailed files
on human anatomy.

482
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:23,094
I bet.

483
01:10:23,178 --> 01:10:26,181
Makes you a more efficient killer,
right?

484
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:27,390
Correct.

485
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:35,440
Does it hurt
when you get shot?

486
01:10:36,483 --> 01:10:39,945
I sense injuries.
The data could be called "pain."

487
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,199
John, help me with the light.

488
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:46,576
- Will these heal up?
- Yes.

489
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:50,872
Good. If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.

490
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:53,666
How long do you live?
I mean, last. Whatever.

491
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:57,045
A hundred and twenty years
with my existing power cell.

492
01:10:57,128 --> 01:11:00,048
Can you learn stuff that you
haven't been programmed with...

493
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:01,549
so you can be...

494
01:11:02,801 --> 01:11:05,512
you know, more human...

495
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:08,306
and not such a dork
all the time?

496
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:15,021
My CPU is a neural net processor,
a learning computer.

497
01:11:15,105 --> 01:11:19,443
But Skynet presets the switch
to read-only when we're sent out alone.

498
01:11:20,819 --> 01:11:23,238
Doesn't want you to do
too much thinking, huh?

499
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:24,656
No.

500
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:28,493
Can we reset the switch?

501
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:50,974
Rotate the two locking cylinders
counterclockwise.

502
01:11:56,855 --> 01:11:58,357
Do it.

503
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:08,992
Now open the port cover.

504
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:14,080
Pull to break the seal.

505
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:21,212
Good, now remove
the shock-damping assembly.

506
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:27,927
You can now access the CPU.

507
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:30,388
- Do you see it?
- Yes.

508
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:34,392
Hold the CPU by its base tab.

509
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:35,893
Pull.

510
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:14,974
Do you see the pin switch?

511
01:13:15,058 --> 01:13:16,935
No! No!

512
01:13:17,936 --> 01:13:20,564
- Out of my way, John.
- Don't kill him.

513
01:13:20,647 --> 01:13:23,942
It, John, not him.
It.

514
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:27,487
Okay, it.
But we need it.

515
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:30,198
Listen to me.
You listen.

516
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:32,408
We're better off on our own.

517
01:13:32,492 --> 01:13:34,285
But he's the only proof we have...

518
01:13:34,369 --> 01:13:36,872
of the future and the war
and all that.

519
01:13:36,955 --> 01:13:38,331
Maybe.

520
01:13:40,959 --> 01:13:43,003
I don't trust it.

521
01:13:43,086 --> 01:13:44,796
But he's my friend, all right?

522
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:48,383
You don't know what it's like
to try to kill one of these things...

523
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:52,053
and if something goes wrong
this could be our last chance, so move!

524
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:54,221
If I'm ever supposed to be
this great military leader...

525
01:13:54,305 --> 01:13:58,142
maybe you should start listening
to my leadership ideas once in a while.

526
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:05,775
Because if my own mother won't,
how do you expect anyone else to?

527
01:14:19,998 --> 01:14:23,042
All right, play it your way.

528
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:32,552
Was there a problem?

529
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:34,137
No problem.

530
01:14:35,847 --> 01:14:37,057
None whatsoever.

531
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:12,634
Are we learning yet?

532
01:15:25,063 --> 01:15:28,024
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

533
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:33,363
Just head south.

534
01:15:42,121 --> 01:15:43,706
Keep it under 65.

535
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:46,793
- We don't want to be pulled over.
- Affirmative.

536
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:52,507
You gotta listen to the way
people talk.

537
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:56,094
You don't say "affirmative"
or some shit like that.

538
01:15:56,177 --> 01:15:58,513
You say, <i>"No problemo."</i>

539
01:15:58,596 --> 01:16:02,517
If someone comes off to you
with an attitude, you say, "Eat me."

540
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:06,896
And if you want to shine them on,
it's <i>"Hasta la vista, baby."</i>

541
01:16:10,108 --> 01:16:12,235
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."

542
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:15,363
If someone gets upset,
you say, "Chill out."

543
01:16:15,446 --> 01:16:16,823
Or you can do combinations.

544
01:16:17,615 --> 01:16:19,909
Chill out, dick-wad.

545
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:22,745
That's great.
See? You're getting it.

546
01:16:34,966 --> 01:16:36,843
You got any cash?

547
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:40,471
I got a couple hundred bucks.
I'll give you half.

548
01:16:40,555 --> 01:16:42,223
Mom!

549
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:45,393
Get some food.

550
01:16:47,395 --> 01:16:49,814
No sense of humor.

551
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:58,823
That's another thing.
You can lighten up a bit yourself.

552
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:01,909
This severe routine
is getting old, okay.

553
01:17:01,993 --> 01:17:03,828
I mean, you're acting
like such a geek.

554
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:05,913
Smile once in a while.

555
01:17:05,997 --> 01:17:07,332
Smile?

556
01:17:07,415 --> 01:17:11,335
Yeah, you know, smile.
Watch.

557
01:17:12,336 --> 01:17:16,048
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?

558
01:17:17,008 --> 01:17:18,843
Give me a break.

559
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,762
Okay, bad example.

560
01:17:22,889 --> 01:17:24,557
See that guy over there?

561
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,517
That's a smile.

562
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:47,330
That's good.

563
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:50,374
Maybe you could practice
in front of a mirror or something.

564
01:17:57,632 --> 01:17:59,551
Want some of my fries?

565
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:12,021
- Need any help?
- No.

566
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:15,191
- I got you!
- No, you didn't!

567
01:18:23,533 --> 01:18:26,536
We're not gonna make it, are we?

568
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:29,789
People, I mean.

569
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,794
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

570
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:38,798
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

571
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:42,134
Break it up before I wring
both of your necks.

572
01:18:43,928 --> 01:18:47,014
I need to know
how Skynet gets built.

573
01:18:47,098 --> 01:18:48,349
Who's responsible?

574
01:18:48,432 --> 01:18:51,977
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

575
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:53,771
Who is that?

576
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:57,775
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

577
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:02,322
Why him?

578
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:05,783
In a few months, he creates
a revolutionary type of microprocessor.

579
01:19:06,826 --> 01:19:08,161
Go on. Then what?

580
01:19:09,287 --> 01:19:12,207
In three years Cyberdyne will become
the largest supplier...

581
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:13,666
of military computer systems.

582
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:17,670
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers...

583
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:19,213
becoming fully unmanned.

584
01:19:19,297 --> 01:19:22,342
Afterwards they fly with
a perfect operational record.

585
01:19:22,425 --> 01:19:25,053
The Skynet funding bill is passed.

586
01:19:25,136 --> 01:19:28,431
The system goes on-line
on August 4, 1997.

587
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:31,684
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defense.

588
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,478
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

589
01:19:34,562 --> 01:19:38,858
It becomes self-aware
at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29.

590
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:42,528
In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.

591
01:19:43,654 --> 01:19:45,906
- Skynet fights back.
- Yes.

592
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:48,743
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

593
01:19:48,826 --> 01:19:51,871
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

594
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:56,333
Skynet knows the Russian counterattack
will eliminate its enemies over here.

595
01:19:56,417 --> 01:19:58,502
Jesus.

596
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:02,506
How much do you know
about Dyson?

597
01:20:04,759 --> 01:20:06,678
I have detailed files.

598
01:20:07,887 --> 01:20:09,847
I want to know everything.

599
01:20:11,057 --> 01:20:15,144
What he looks like,
where he lives, everything.

600
01:20:26,781 --> 01:20:28,199
Miles.

601
01:20:30,618 --> 01:20:32,578
<i>Miles.</i>

602
01:20:50,471 --> 01:20:52,223
Are you going to work all day?

603
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:56,185
I'm sorry, baby.
But this thing is just kicking my ass.

604
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:57,561
Miles, it's Sunday.

605
01:20:57,645 --> 01:21:00,398
You promised to take the kids
to Raging Waters today.

606
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:03,484
I can't...

607
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:05,861
I'm on a roll.

608
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,918
Baby, this is going
to blow them all away.

609
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:24,088
- It's a neural net processor.
- I know. You told me.

610
01:21:24,171 --> 01:21:27,341
It's a neural net processor.
It thinks and learns like we do.

611
01:21:27,425 --> 01:21:30,094
It's superconducting
at room temperature.

612
01:21:30,177 --> 01:21:34,431
Other computers are just
pocket calculators by comparison.

613
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:38,602
But why is that
so goddamn important, Miles?

614
01:21:38,686 --> 01:21:40,021
I really need to know...

615
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:43,190
because sometimes I feel
like I'm going crazy here.

616
01:21:44,859 --> 01:21:46,861
Baby, I am this close.

617
01:21:47,945 --> 01:21:48,988
Come here.

618
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:54,118
Imagine a jet airliner...

619
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:56,870
with a pilot that never gets tired,
never makes mistakes...

620
01:21:56,954 --> 01:21:58,831
never shows up to work
with a hangover.

621
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:03,627
Meet the pilot.

622
01:22:03,711 --> 01:22:06,797
Why did we get married, Miles?
Why did we have these children?

623
01:22:06,881 --> 01:22:07,924
You don't need us.

624
01:22:08,007 --> 01:22:11,427
Your heart and your mind
are in here.

625
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:14,388
But it doesn't love you
like we do.

626
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:25,191
I'm sorry. Really.

627
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:29,528
How about spending some time
with your other babies?

628
01:22:32,198 --> 01:22:34,033
<i>Raging Waters!</i>

629
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:05,647
Wait in the car.

630
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:45,687
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

631
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,210
Hey, big John.

632
01:24:08,836 --> 01:24:09,962
What's up?

633
01:24:11,297 --> 01:24:13,549
He's cool, Enrique.
He's with me.

634
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:16,802
He's... Uncle Bob.

635
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:19,096
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

636
01:24:19,179 --> 01:24:20,931
Uncle Bob, huh?

637
01:24:22,016 --> 01:24:23,267
Okay.

638
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:31,317
Drink?

639
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:38,073
"Uncle Bob"?

640
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:42,869
You're pretty famous,
all over the goddamn TV.

641
01:24:42,953 --> 01:24:45,622
Pictures of you, John,
your big friend here.

642
01:24:45,706 --> 01:24:47,666
Cops are going nuts
looking for you.

643
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:55,549
I just came for my stuff.
I need clothes, food and a truck.

644
01:24:55,633 --> 01:24:57,676
How about the fillings in my teeth?

645
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,929
Now, Enrique.

646
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:03,474
You two,
you're on weapons detail.

647
01:25:03,557 --> 01:25:05,225
Let's go.

648
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:27,748
One thing about my mom...

649
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:32,002
she always plans ahead.

650
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:43,890
Excellent.

651
01:25:54,525 --> 01:25:58,195
This is my best truck,
but the starter motor's gone.

652
01:25:58,278 --> 01:26:00,197
You got time to change it out?

653
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:03,617
Yeah. I'm gonna wait till dark
to cross the border.

654
01:26:03,701 --> 01:26:05,203
Enrique.

655
01:26:05,285 --> 01:26:08,914
It's dangerous for you here.
You get out tonight too, okay?

656
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:11,458
Sure.

657
01:26:11,542 --> 01:26:15,337
Just drop by anytime
and totally fuck up my life, all right?

658
01:26:19,758 --> 01:26:23,220
See, I grew up in places like this...

659
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:25,722
so I just thought
that's how people lived...

660
01:26:27,057 --> 01:26:29,768
riding around in helicopters...

661
01:26:30,853 --> 01:26:33,064
learning how to blow shit up.

662
01:26:34,565 --> 01:26:37,234
But then when my mom got busted...

663
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:39,695
I got put into a regular school.

664
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:43,115
All the other kids
were into Nintendo.

665
01:26:57,379 --> 01:26:59,506
Are you ever afraid?

666
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:00,883
No.

667
01:27:04,762 --> 01:27:06,555
Not even of dying?

668
01:27:07,097 --> 01:27:09,057
No.

669
01:27:13,395 --> 01:27:17,649
You don't feel any emotion about it,
one way or another?

670
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:21,695
No. I have to stay functional
until my mission is complete.

671
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:29,828
Then it doesn't matter.

672
01:27:29,912 --> 01:27:33,624
I have to stay functional too.
"I'm too important."

673
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:51,767
That's definitely you.

674
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:05,781
Most of the guys my mom
hung around with were geeks...

675
01:28:06,156 --> 01:28:09,660
but there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.

676
01:28:09,743 --> 01:28:11,662
He taught me engines.

677
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:13,914
Hold here.

678
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:16,416
Mom screwed it up, of course.

679
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,919
She'd always tell 'em
about Judgment Day...

680
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:21,796
and me being this world leader.

681
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:23,840
That'd be all she wrote.

682
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:26,301
Torque wrench, please.

683
01:28:29,846 --> 01:28:33,058
I wish I could've met
my real dad.

684
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:34,893
You will.

685
01:28:34,977 --> 01:28:37,146
Yeah, I guess.

686
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:41,066
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

687
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:44,861
They sent him back through time
to 1984.

688
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:46,363
Man.

689
01:28:47,906 --> 01:28:50,367
He hasn't even been born yet.

690
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,079
It messes with your head.

691
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,752
- The other bolt.
- Oh. Here.

692
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:09,636
Mom and him were only together
for one night.

693
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:12,180
She still loves him, I guess.

694
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:15,142
I see her crying sometimes.

695
01:29:15,225 --> 01:29:19,229
She denies it totally, of course,
like she got something stuck in her eye.

696
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:25,735
Why do you cry?

697
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:28,322
- You mean people?
- Yeah.

698
01:29:28,405 --> 01:29:29,781
I don't know.

699
01:29:29,865 --> 01:29:31,950
We just cry...

700
01:29:32,034 --> 01:29:34,578
you know, when it hurts.

701
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:42,419
Pain causes it?

702
01:29:43,503 --> 01:29:45,630
No. It's different.

703
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:49,009
It's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyway.

704
01:29:49,092 --> 01:29:50,677
- You get it?
- No.

705
01:29:51,928 --> 01:29:53,638
All right, my man!

706
01:29:55,474 --> 01:29:57,101
Give me five.

707
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:01,271
Just put out your hand
like this.

708
01:30:02,606 --> 01:30:06,943
All right! Now hit me.
Give me five. Do the same thing.

709
01:30:11,657 --> 01:30:14,117
Okay, that's good.
Up high.

710
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:16,369
Five low.

711
01:30:16,453 --> 01:30:18,121
Too slow.

712
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:23,376
I'm just kidding.
One more time.

713
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:25,671
Good. Now try it.

714
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:27,714
Now do me.
Give me five.

715
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:33,720
<i>Watching John with the machine,
it was suddenly so clear.</i>

716
01:30:33,804 --> 01:30:36,724
<i>The Terminator would never stop.</i>

717
01:30:36,807 --> 01:30:40,769
<i>It would never leave him,
never hurt him...</i>

718
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:44,272
<i>never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him...</i>

719
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:46,942
<i>or be too busy
to spend time with him.</i>

720
01:30:47,818 --> 01:30:49,903
<i>It would always be there...</i>

721
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:52,655
<i>and it would die
to protect him.</i>

722
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:57,411
<i>Of all the would-be fathers
who came and went over the years...</i>

723
01:30:57,494 --> 01:30:59,538
<i>this thing, this machine...</i>

724
01:30:59,621 --> 01:31:01,998
<i>was the only one
who measured up.</i>

725
01:31:02,749 --> 01:31:04,584
<i>In an insane world...</i>

726
01:31:04,668 --> 01:31:06,628
<i>it was the sanest choice.</i>

727
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:46,352
Hey, let's try this one.

728
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:54,152
There we go.

729
01:34:40,258 --> 01:34:42,761
She said go south with him
like you planned.

730
01:34:42,844 --> 01:34:45,055
- She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom!

731
01:34:46,848 --> 01:34:48,016
Mom, wait!

732
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:04,741
"No fate."

733
01:35:05,951 --> 01:35:08,412
No fate but what we make.

734
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:12,540
My father told her this.

735
01:35:15,085 --> 01:35:19,381
I made him memorize it in the future
as a message to her.

736
01:35:21,049 --> 01:35:22,968
Never mind.

737
01:35:23,051 --> 01:35:26,388
Okay, the whole thing goes...

738
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:29,182
The future's not set.

739
01:35:29,265 --> 01:35:32,769
There's no fate but what
we make for ourselves.

740
01:35:32,852 --> 01:35:35,855
She intends to change the future.

741
01:35:35,939 --> 01:35:37,399
Yeah, I guess.

742
01:35:38,942 --> 01:35:40,777
Oh, shit!

743
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:42,779
- Dyson.
- Yeah.

744
01:35:42,862 --> 01:35:46,366
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

745
01:35:46,449 --> 01:35:48,451
She's gonna blow him away.

746
01:35:48,535 --> 01:35:50,620
Come on! Let's go!

747
01:36:03,008 --> 01:36:05,051
This is tactically dangerous.

748
01:36:05,135 --> 01:36:06,261
Drive faster.

749
01:36:06,344 --> 01:36:08,847
The T-1000 has the same files
that I do.

750
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:12,350
It knows what I know.
It might anticipate this move.

751
01:36:12,434 --> 01:36:14,936
I don't care.
We gotta stop her.

752
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:16,938
Killing Dyson
might prevent the war.

753
01:36:17,022 --> 01:36:20,526
I don't care!
Haven't you learned anything yet?

754
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:23,695
Haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?

755
01:36:26,573 --> 01:36:29,076
Look, maybe you don't care
if you live or die...

756
01:36:29,159 --> 01:36:31,328
but everybody's not like that.

757
01:36:31,411 --> 01:36:34,998
We have feelings.
We hurt. We're afraid.

758
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:41,170
You got to learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. It's important.

759
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:21,461
Danny, I told you to go to bed,
like your sister.

760
01:37:21,544 --> 01:37:24,922
Just a couple of minutes, Mom!

761
01:37:41,064 --> 01:37:43,400
Danny, your time is up!

762
01:37:43,483 --> 01:37:46,402
Come brush your teeth
and get to bed.

763
01:38:28,194 --> 01:38:29,529
Daddy!

764
01:38:29,612 --> 01:38:32,115
Danny, go! Go!

765
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:42,500
- Tarissa, run!
- Oh, my God!

766
01:38:49,591 --> 01:38:51,635
Just take Danny and run!

767
01:38:51,718 --> 01:38:52,969
Run!

768
01:38:53,052 --> 01:38:54,804
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

769
01:39:13,698 --> 01:39:14,699
Daddy!

770
01:39:16,409 --> 01:39:17,869
Nobody fucking move!

771
01:39:18,703 --> 01:39:19,954
Don't hurt my daddy!

772
01:39:20,038 --> 01:39:21,581
On the floor, bitch.

773
01:39:21,664 --> 01:39:23,833
Get down now!

774
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:25,793
Get out of the way!

775
01:39:25,877 --> 01:39:27,337
Don't hurt him!

776
01:39:28,838 --> 01:39:30,840
Get on the floor now!

777
01:39:33,885 --> 01:39:35,595
Just let the boy go.

778
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:37,263
Shut up. Shut up.

779
01:39:37,347 --> 01:39:38,640
Shut up!

780
01:39:38,723 --> 01:39:41,309
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

781
01:39:41,392 --> 01:39:43,644
- It's all your fault!
- What?

782
01:39:43,728 --> 01:39:45,855
I'm not gonna let you do it.

783
01:40:37,865 --> 01:40:39,950
Shit! We're too late!

784
01:40:44,455 --> 01:40:45,581
Check them.

785
01:40:49,252 --> 01:40:51,254
Look at me, Mom.

786
01:40:51,337 --> 01:40:53,548
Are you hurt?

787
01:40:57,176 --> 01:40:59,261
I almost...

788
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:13,234
It'll be okay.

789
01:41:13,318 --> 01:41:15,278
We'll figure something out.
Okay?

790
01:41:16,863 --> 01:41:18,490
I promise.

791
01:41:21,784 --> 01:41:24,745
You came here to stop me.

792
01:41:25,621 --> 01:41:27,581
Yeah, I did.

793
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:32,462
I love you, John.

794
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:35,715
I always have.

795
01:41:37,633 --> 01:41:39,051
I know.

796
01:41:46,059 --> 01:41:48,270
Deep penetration.

797
01:41:49,854 --> 01:41:51,773
No shattered bone.

798
01:41:51,856 --> 01:41:54,817
Hold here.
The pressure should stop the bleeding.

799
01:42:05,578 --> 01:42:06,996
Who are you people?

800
01:42:07,955 --> 01:42:09,373
Show him.

801
01:42:12,043 --> 01:42:16,214
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Show me your room.

802
01:42:56,712 --> 01:42:57,922
Oh, my God.

803
01:42:58,005 --> 01:43:00,675
Now listen to me
very carefully.

804
01:43:06,556 --> 01:43:10,685
<i>Dyson listened while the Terminator
laid it all down.</i>

805
01:43:10,768 --> 01:43:14,647
<i>Skynet. Judgment Day.</i>

806
01:43:14,730 --> 01:43:17,024
<i>The history of things to come.</i>

807
01:43:18,443 --> 01:43:21,196
<i>It's not every day that
you find out you're responsible...</i>

808
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:24,115
<i>for three billion deaths.</i>

809
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:26,117
<i>He took it pretty well.</i>

810
01:43:28,119 --> 01:43:30,580
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

811
01:43:36,586 --> 01:43:38,713
You're judging me...

812
01:43:38,796 --> 01:43:41,257
on things I haven't even done yet.

813
01:43:45,470 --> 01:43:47,597
How were we supposed to know?

814
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:52,017
Yeah.

815
01:43:52,101 --> 01:43:54,478
Right.

816
01:43:54,562 --> 01:43:56,689
How were you supposed to know?

817
01:43:57,732 --> 01:44:01,444
Fucking men like you
built the hydrogen bomb.

818
01:44:01,527 --> 01:44:04,113
Men like you...

819
01:44:04,197 --> 01:44:05,615
thought it up.

820
01:44:09,494 --> 01:44:11,454
You think you're so creative.

821
01:44:12,872 --> 01:44:15,958
You don't know what it's like
to really create something...

822
01:44:16,042 --> 01:44:18,169
to create a life...

823
01:44:18,252 --> 01:44:19,795
to feel it growing inside you.

824
01:44:19,879 --> 01:44:22,798
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

825
01:44:22,882 --> 01:44:24,550
Mom!

826
01:44:24,634 --> 01:44:28,387
We need to be a little more
constructive here. Okay?

827
01:44:28,471 --> 01:44:30,556
We still have to stop this
from happening, don't we?

828
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:33,476
But I thought...

829
01:44:33,559 --> 01:44:37,563
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

830
01:44:37,647 --> 01:44:42,443
That's right. There's no way I'm going
to finish the new processor. Not now.

831
01:44:42,527 --> 01:44:45,989
Forget it. I'm out of it.
I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.

832
01:44:46,072 --> 01:44:47,949
That's not good enough.

833
01:44:48,032 --> 01:44:49,951
No one must follow your work.

834
01:44:50,034 --> 01:44:51,911
Right.

835
01:44:51,994 --> 01:44:56,332
All right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab...

836
01:44:56,415 --> 01:44:58,000
the files, the disk drives...

837
01:44:58,084 --> 01:45:00,712
everything here.

838
01:45:00,795 --> 01:45:02,880
Everything.

839
01:45:02,964 --> 01:45:04,883
I don't care.

840
01:45:06,175 --> 01:45:07,176
The chip.

841
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:09,345
- Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

842
01:45:09,428 --> 01:45:11,847
It's at Cyberdyne.
It's from the other one like you.

843
01:45:11,931 --> 01:45:14,642
The CPU from the first Terminator.

844
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:17,103
Son of a bitch!
I knew it!

845
01:45:17,186 --> 01:45:19,897
They told us not to ask
where they got it.

846
01:45:19,981 --> 01:45:22,316
Those lying motherfuckers.

847
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:24,193
It's scary stuff.
Radically advanced.

848
01:45:24,277 --> 01:45:25,403
It was smashed.

849
01:45:25,486 --> 01:45:29,115
It didn't work, but it gave us ideas,
took us in new directions.

850
01:45:29,198 --> 01:45:31,200
Things we would've never...

851
01:45:33,369 --> 01:45:35,454
All my work was based on it.

852
01:45:35,538 --> 01:45:37,373
It must be destroyed.

853
01:45:39,625 --> 01:45:42,628
Can you get us in?
Past security?

854
01:45:42,712 --> 01:45:44,797
I think so, yeah. When?

855
01:45:49,719 --> 01:45:50,720
Now?

856
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:57,685
<i>The future,
always so clear to me...</i>

857
01:45:57,768 --> 01:46:00,771
<i>had become like
a black highway at night.</i>

858
01:46:00,855 --> 01:46:03,566
<i>We were in
uncharted territory now...</i>

859
01:46:03,649 --> 01:46:06,569
<i>making up history
as we went along.</i>

860
01:46:44,899 --> 01:46:46,818
Carl, right?

861
01:46:48,152 --> 01:46:51,572
Friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd...

862
01:46:51,656 --> 01:46:53,658
take 'em upstairs
and show 'em around.

863
01:46:53,741 --> 01:46:57,036
Mr. Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

864
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:59,288
I need written authorization...

865
01:47:00,331 --> 01:47:02,333
I insist.

866
01:47:02,416 --> 01:47:04,168
Don't even think about it.

867
01:47:15,137 --> 01:47:16,597
It's okay.

868
01:47:18,015 --> 01:47:21,143
It takes two keys, turned
simultaneously, to open the vault.

869
01:47:21,227 --> 01:47:24,146
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

870
01:47:25,481 --> 01:47:26,941
Gibbons?

871
01:47:29,985 --> 01:47:31,820
Gibbons! Come on, man!

872
01:47:31,904 --> 01:47:34,990
You can't leave the desk
like that!

873
01:47:39,829 --> 01:47:41,331
Oh, shit.

874
01:47:58,889 --> 01:48:00,891
My card should access this.

875
01:48:05,563 --> 01:48:07,982
- What is it?
- Damn it.

876
01:48:08,065 --> 01:48:10,025
The silent alarm's been tripped.

877
01:48:16,198 --> 01:48:18,951
It's neutralized all the codes
in the entire building.

878
01:48:19,034 --> 01:48:20,953
Nothing will open anywhere now.

879
01:48:22,037 --> 01:48:23,872
We have to abort.

880
01:48:27,084 --> 01:48:30,504
We go all the way.
Okay?

881
01:48:32,631 --> 01:48:36,427
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

882
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:38,971
- I think it's that guy from the mall.
- It is.

883
01:48:39,054 --> 01:48:40,973
It's him and the woman.

884
01:48:42,558 --> 01:48:45,728
Just send everything
you got in the area right now.

885
01:48:47,938 --> 01:48:51,400
I have a personal entry code
for the lab. It may still work.

886
01:48:55,905 --> 01:48:56,948
It's no good.

887
01:48:57,031 --> 01:48:58,574
Let me try mine.

888
01:49:03,537 --> 01:49:05,622
John, fire in the hole!

889
01:49:17,676 --> 01:49:22,473
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the Halon system.

890
01:49:29,647 --> 01:49:32,108
You have to wait
until the gas clears.

891
01:49:34,610 --> 01:49:35,903
Put this on.

892
01:49:49,875 --> 01:49:52,378
All right, let's get to work.

893
01:50:13,566 --> 01:50:16,861
<i>All units in the vicinity
and all units able to respond...</i>

894
01:50:16,944 --> 01:50:21,740
<i>a 211 in progress, 2144 Kramer Street,
the Cyberdyne building.</i>

895
01:50:21,824 --> 01:50:23,492
<i>Suspect one is white female...</i>

896
01:50:23,576 --> 01:50:27,038
<i>identified as last name Connor,
first name Sarah.</i>

897
01:50:27,121 --> 01:50:30,041
<i>Escaped last night
from Pescadero State Hospital.</i>

898
01:50:30,124 --> 01:50:32,001
<i>Suspect two: White male...</i>

899
01:50:35,754 --> 01:50:37,881
All the disks in my office...

900
01:50:37,965 --> 01:50:40,092
all the disks
in that office over there...

901
01:50:40,175 --> 01:50:42,177
everything behind my desk...

902
01:50:42,261 --> 01:50:44,513
and all the processors
on my left.

903
01:50:44,597 --> 01:50:47,183
We'll blow those with the C4.

904
01:51:00,779 --> 01:51:02,823
Can I...

905
01:51:02,906 --> 01:51:04,699
Excuse me.

906
01:51:06,368 --> 01:51:08,996
Can I borrow that thing?

907
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:20,424
I worked a lot of years on this thing.

908
01:51:24,595 --> 01:51:26,639
<i>One-Mary-23,
give me that location again.</i>

909
01:51:26,722 --> 01:51:28,474
<i>2111 Kramer.</i>

910
01:51:28,557 --> 01:51:31,685
<i>Suspects are armed and
considered extremely dangerous.</i>

911
01:52:23,946 --> 01:52:25,739
All right.

912
01:52:25,823 --> 01:52:27,616
7-2-5-6.

913
01:52:34,456 --> 01:52:35,791
Easy money.

914
01:52:44,883 --> 01:52:47,302
Oh, shit. Not good.

915
01:52:52,391 --> 01:52:54,018
How we doing?

916
01:52:54,101 --> 01:52:55,769
Primer cord is set.

917
01:52:55,853 --> 01:52:58,314
One more barrel,
two more minutes.

918
01:53:02,192 --> 01:53:05,112
- How do we set them off?
- Remote control.

919
01:53:05,195 --> 01:53:07,572
Piece of cake.

920
01:53:07,656 --> 01:53:09,199
- We got company.
- Police?

921
01:53:09,283 --> 01:53:12,620
- How many?
- All of 'em, I think.

922
01:53:12,703 --> 01:53:14,121
Go. I'll finish here.

923
01:53:16,081 --> 01:53:17,499
Come on.

924
01:53:18,584 --> 01:53:20,503
I'll take care of the police.

925
01:53:20,586 --> 01:53:21,879
Wait! You swore!

926
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:26,300
Trust me.

927
01:53:39,563 --> 01:53:41,190
<i>You at the window!</i>

928
01:53:41,273 --> 01:53:44,735
<i>Drop your weapon and place
your hands on top of your head!</i>

929
01:53:46,069 --> 01:53:47,904
Holy shit!

930
01:53:47,988 --> 01:53:49,531
That's a mini-gun!

931
01:54:11,762 --> 01:54:14,098
- Come on!
- Oh, shit!

932
01:54:14,181 --> 01:54:15,724
Go! Go! Go!

933
01:55:03,313 --> 01:55:04,773
Fire!

934
01:55:22,124 --> 01:55:23,751
Same time, to the left.

935
01:55:23,834 --> 01:55:26,170
One, two, three, go.

936
01:55:38,307 --> 01:55:41,143
In order to get that out...

937
01:55:47,941 --> 01:55:50,694
We got Skynet by the balls now.

938
01:55:50,777 --> 01:55:52,487
Come on, let's book.

939
01:55:53,405 --> 01:55:55,324
Hold your fire!

940
01:56:20,515 --> 01:56:23,018
- Ready to rock?
- Ready.

941
01:56:25,771 --> 01:56:27,064
Time to go.

942
01:56:27,147 --> 01:56:28,607
Now.

943
01:56:28,690 --> 01:56:32,235
- Take this. They'll use gas.
- Come on.

944
01:56:32,319 --> 01:56:35,405
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

945
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:02,433
Mom! Mom!

946
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:47,936
Shit!

947
01:57:49,354 --> 01:57:52,274
She's in the clean room.
There's no way outta there.

948
01:58:01,783 --> 01:58:02,784
Get down!

949
01:58:10,292 --> 01:58:11,710
Here.

950
01:58:37,235 --> 01:58:40,655
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

951
01:58:44,826 --> 01:58:46,328
Fall back!

952
01:58:46,411 --> 01:58:47,996
Everybody out!

953
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:49,998
Fall back now!
Go! Go! Go!

954
01:59:25,408 --> 01:59:27,368
<i>We got a war zone here!</i>

955
01:59:59,276 --> 02:00:00,986
Shut your eyes.

956
02:00:07,576 --> 02:00:10,746
Stay here. I'll be back.

957
02:00:18,587 --> 02:00:20,922
Get down on the floor!
Face down!

958
02:00:23,633 --> 02:00:25,218
On the floor now!

959
02:00:27,554 --> 02:00:29,056
Okay, drop him!

960
02:01:48,927 --> 02:01:50,345
Here, hold this.

961
02:02:23,753 --> 02:02:24,754
Go!

962
02:03:03,710 --> 02:03:04,628
Shit!

963
02:03:18,224 --> 02:03:19,934
Get out.

964
02:03:38,953 --> 02:03:40,246
Listen.

965
02:03:40,330 --> 02:03:43,041
No matter what happens,
stay under these vests.

966
02:03:43,124 --> 02:03:44,375
- You got it?
- Yeah.

967
02:03:44,459 --> 02:03:45,919
All right.

968
02:04:00,475 --> 02:04:01,726
Chopper's coming in!

969
02:04:01,810 --> 02:04:02,936
It's him.

970
02:05:00,702 --> 02:05:02,037
Shit!

971
02:05:04,914 --> 02:05:06,707
Stay down!

972
02:06:20,990 --> 02:06:23,451
Goddamn! You all right?

973
02:06:30,959 --> 02:06:33,378
Come on, Mom,
we gotta get out.

974
02:06:35,296 --> 02:06:36,923
Take the shotgun.

975
02:06:40,176 --> 02:06:41,761
Are you hurt?

976
02:06:54,941 --> 02:06:57,861
Holy shit.
Come on, Mom. Come on!

977
02:06:57,944 --> 02:07:00,655
- We need your truck.
- Hurry!

978
02:07:05,660 --> 02:07:08,162
- Come on. Hurry.
- Get in.

979
02:07:11,165 --> 02:07:12,375
Go!

980
02:07:18,381 --> 02:07:20,383
What the hell...

981
02:07:26,264 --> 02:07:29,017
- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

982
02:07:30,685 --> 02:07:32,353
Here. This'll work.

983
02:07:37,942 --> 02:07:39,652
He's gaining.

984
02:07:42,196 --> 02:07:43,864
Step on it!

985
02:07:43,948 --> 02:07:46,742
- This is the vehicle's top speed.
- I can run faster than this!

986
02:07:57,587 --> 02:07:59,047
Coming up, to the right.

987
02:08:01,090 --> 02:08:03,050
Watch it! Watch it!

988
02:08:25,615 --> 02:08:27,742
- Drive.
- Where are you going?

989
02:08:35,208 --> 02:08:37,127
Take the off-ramp.

990
02:08:46,803 --> 02:08:47,971
Shit!

991
02:08:51,140 --> 02:08:52,224
Hold on!

992
02:09:38,062 --> 02:09:39,689
Don't stop!

993
02:09:47,530 --> 02:09:48,948
Go straight!

994
02:09:51,576 --> 02:09:53,870
- Look out!
- Duck!

995
02:10:08,009 --> 02:10:09,969
Get the hell outta here!

996
02:10:15,475 --> 02:10:18,520
Get outta here!
Let's go! Come on!

997
02:11:35,513 --> 02:11:37,974
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

998
02:12:27,565 --> 02:12:28,983
We don't have much time.

999
02:12:51,589 --> 02:12:52,840
Let's go.

1000
02:12:53,925 --> 02:12:55,718
We gotta get outta here.

1001
02:12:55,801 --> 02:12:57,886
Come on! Get up!

1002
02:13:11,484 --> 02:13:13,194
Hand me the shotgun.

1003
02:13:18,032 --> 02:13:20,326
Put your weight on me, Mom.

1004
02:13:21,118 --> 02:13:23,037
Hurry!

1005
02:13:26,582 --> 02:13:28,209
Come on, Mom.

1006
02:13:34,715 --> 02:13:36,050
Get up!

1007
02:14:07,581 --> 02:14:09,541
This way. Come on.

1008
02:14:36,569 --> 02:14:38,237
No! Wait!

1009
02:14:38,529 --> 02:14:42,450
Wait. No. No.
It's too hot. Go back.

1010
02:14:50,666 --> 02:14:52,918
- Go. Run.
- No! We gotta stick together.

1011
02:14:53,002 --> 02:14:55,004
John, you've got to go now.

1012
02:14:55,087 --> 02:14:57,256
- John!
- Go! Now!

1013
02:16:11,705 --> 02:16:13,498
Get up the steps.

1014
02:16:20,881 --> 02:16:22,383
Get up.

1015
02:16:23,175 --> 02:16:25,344
Come on, Mom.
I got you.

1016
02:16:59,753 --> 02:17:02,089
Grab the chain. Grab it.

1017
02:17:03,465 --> 02:17:06,218
Grab it. Go. Go!

1018
02:17:16,562 --> 02:17:19,899
Mom, come on! Mom!

1019
02:18:09,031 --> 02:18:10,824
Call to John.

1020
02:18:13,619 --> 02:18:15,496
I know this hurts.

1021
02:18:17,289 --> 02:18:18,957
Call John.

1022
02:18:35,349 --> 02:18:38,018
Call to John now.

1023
02:18:40,020 --> 02:18:41,897
Fuck you.

1024
02:21:59,428 --> 02:22:00,888
Help!

1025
02:22:21,533 --> 02:22:23,118
Mom.

1026
02:22:28,332 --> 02:22:30,709
- Help me.
- Get out of the way, John.

1027
02:22:31,668 --> 02:22:33,920
- John! John!
- Shoot!

1028
02:23:29,935 --> 02:23:32,354
Get down!

1029
02:25:05,655 --> 02:25:07,824
Get up. Come on.

1030
02:25:10,077 --> 02:25:11,870
Holy shit.

1031
02:25:11,953 --> 02:25:14,414
I need a vacation.

1032
02:25:27,636 --> 02:25:30,430
Is it dead?

1033
02:25:30,514 --> 02:25:31,932
Terminated.

1034
02:25:35,435 --> 02:25:37,103
Will this melt in there?

1035
02:25:40,065 --> 02:25:41,942
Yes. Throw it in.

1036
02:25:49,032 --> 02:25:50,951
And the chip.

1037
02:26:06,133 --> 02:26:07,760
It's over.

1038
02:26:14,599 --> 02:26:16,267
There's one more chip.

1039
02:26:20,939 --> 02:26:23,191
And it must be destroyed also.

1040
02:26:28,655 --> 02:26:30,240
Here.

1041
02:26:30,323 --> 02:26:33,701
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

1042
02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:49,301
I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.

1043
02:26:49,384 --> 02:26:51,678
No, it'll be okay.
Stay with us.

1044
02:26:51,761 --> 02:26:53,763
- It'll be okay.
- I have to go away.

1045
02:26:53,847 --> 02:26:56,433
No, don't do it.
Please, don't go.

1046
02:26:56,516 --> 02:26:59,602
I must go away, John.

1047
02:26:59,686 --> 02:27:01,146
No, wait.

1048
02:27:01,229 --> 02:27:04,149
- You don't have to do this.
- I'm sorry.

1049
02:27:05,066 --> 02:27:07,319
No, don't do it! Don't go!

1050
02:27:07,402 --> 02:27:09,362
It has to end here.

1051
02:27:10,572 --> 02:27:13,867
I order you not to go!

1052
02:27:21,833 --> 02:27:23,877
I know now why you cry.

1053
02:27:26,254 --> 02:27:28,715
But it's something
I can never do.

1054
02:28:03,041 --> 02:28:05,252
Good-bye.

1055
02:29:44,476 --> 02:29:48,730
<i>August 29, 1997, came and went.</i>

1056
02:29:48,813 --> 02:29:53,151
<i>Nothing much happened.
Michael Jackson turned 40.</i>

1057
02:29:53,234 --> 02:29:55,319
<i>There was no Judgment Day.</i>

1058
02:29:55,403 --> 02:29:58,615
<i>People went to work
as they always do.</i>

1059
02:29:58,698 --> 02:30:04,579
<i>Laughed, complained,
watched TV, made love.</i>

1060
02:30:04,663 --> 02:30:06,623
<i>I wanted to run
through the street yelling...</i>

1061
02:30:06,706 --> 02:30:12,003
<i>to grab them all and say,
"Every day from this day on is a gift.</i>

1062
02:30:12,087 --> 02:30:14,381
<i>"Use it well."</i>

1063
02:30:14,464 --> 02:30:16,967
<i>Instead, I got drunk.</i>

1064
02:30:17,050 --> 02:30:19,844
<i>That was 30 years ago.</i>

1065
02:30:19,928 --> 02:30:24,391
But the dark future which never came
still exists for me.

1066
02:30:24,474 --> 02:30:28,186
And it always will,
like the traces of a dream.

1067
02:30:30,522 --> 02:30:34,401
John fights the war differently
than it was foretold.

1068
02:30:34,484 --> 02:30:37,320
Here, on the battlefield
of the Senate...

1069
02:30:37,404 --> 02:30:40,032
his weapons are common sense...

1070
02:30:40,782 --> 02:30:42,951
and hope.

1071
02:30:44,035 --> 02:30:46,162
Tie me, Grandma. Tie me!

1072
02:30:54,045 --> 02:30:56,214
- How's that?
- Thank you, Grandma.

1073
02:30:59,968 --> 02:31:02,053
<i>The luxury of hope...</i>

1074
02:31:02,137 --> 02:31:04,848
<i>was given to me
by the Terminator.</i>

1075
02:31:06,057 --> 02:31:10,979
<i>Because if a machine can learn
the value of human life...</i>

1076
02:31:11,980 --> 02:31:13,773
<i>maybe we can too.</i>
