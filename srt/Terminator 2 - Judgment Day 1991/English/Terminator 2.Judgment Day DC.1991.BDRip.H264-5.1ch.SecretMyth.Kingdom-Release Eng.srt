<i>Three billion human lives ended
on August 29, 1997.</i>

3
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:26,215
<i>The survivors of the nuclear fire...</i>

4
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,016
<i>called the war 'Judgment Day'.</i>

5
00:01:29,054 --> 00:01:32,182
<i>They lived only to face
a new nightmare-</i>

6
00:01:32,224 --> 00:01:34,283
<i>the war against the machines.</i>

7
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,238
<i>The computer which controlled
the machines, Skynet...</i>

8
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:59,302
<i>sent two Terminators
back through time.</i>

9
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:03,442
<i>Their mission: to destroy the leader
of the human resistance...</i>

<i>John Connor, my son.</i>

11
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:12,648
<i>The first Terminator was programmed
to strike at me...</i>

12
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,684
<i>in the year 1984...</i>

13

14
00:03:17,132 --> 00:03:18,998
<i>It failed.</i>

15
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,934
<i>The second was set to strike
at John himself...</i>

16
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,460
<i>when he was still a child.</i>

17
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:31,907
<i>As before, the resistance was able
to send a lone warrior...</i>

18
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:34,279
<i>a protector for John.</i>

19
00:03:34,316 --> 00:03:37,751
<i>It was just a question of which one

I need your clothes, your boots
and your motorcycle.

21
00:08:04,391 --> 00:08:06,860
You forgot to say 'please'.

22
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,239
Get him off me!

23
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:49,298
Pull it out!

24
00:09:07,523 --> 00:09:09,548
Take it.

25
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:38,679
Can't let you take
the man's wheels, son.

26
00:09:38,721 --> 00:09:41,588
Now, get off
before I put you down.

27
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:52,867
That's it, goddamn it.

R-31 David, Sherman Code 6...

29
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:59,725
at the Sixth Street Bridge and Santa Fe
on electrical disturbance.

30
00:11:00,772 --> 00:11:03,036
<i>Ten-four, R-31 David.</i>

31
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:42,901
John, get in there and clean up
that pigsty of yours.

32
00:12:54,422 --> 00:12:56,652
Your foster parents
are kind of dicks, huh?

33
00:12:56,691 --> 00:13:00,058
I swear, I have had it
with that goddamn kid.

34
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:02,791
- He won't even answer me anymore.
- Honey, move.

35
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:05,801
Would you get off your butt
and help me?

36
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:08,701
- Todd!
- What?

37
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:12,139
He hasn't cleaned that room of his
in a month.

38
00:13:12,174 --> 00:13:15,337
Oh, it's an emergency.
Hang on. I'll get right on it.

39
00:13:23,017 --> 00:13:24,815
Come on.

40
00:13:24,853 --> 00:13:28,118
Get your ass inside.
Do what your mother tells you.

41
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:32,057
She's not my mother, Todd.

42
00:13:58,554 --> 00:14:00,249
This next patient is interesting.

43
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:02,780
I've been following the case
for years.

44
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:04,952
A 29-year-old female...

45
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:09,960
diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

46
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,299
The usual indicators: depression,
anxiety, violent acting out...

47
00:14:13,336 --> 00:14:15,099
delusions of persecution.

48
00:14:21,478 --> 00:14:24,910
The delusional architecture
is fairly unique.

49
00:14:24,945 --> 00:14:27,811
She believes that a machine
called the Terminator...

50
00:14:27,848 --> 00:14:30,715
which looks human, of course,
was sent back through time...

51
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:33,376
- to kill her.
- That's original.

52
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:36,685
And also that the father
of her child...

53
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:40,054
was a soldier sent back
to protect her.

54
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,060
He was from the future too.

55
00:14:42,093 --> 00:14:46,757
The year 2029,
if I remember correctly.

56
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:49,028
And here we are.

57
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:50,927
<i>Morning, Sarah.</i>

58
00:14:55,273 --> 00:14:59,209
Good morning, Dr. Silberman.
How's the knee?

59
00:15:01,045 --> 00:15:03,014
<i>Fine, Sarah.</i>

60
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:06,413
She stabbed me in the kneecap...

61
00:15:06,451 --> 00:15:10,013
with my pen a few weeks ago.

62
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:11,544
Repeated escape attempts.

63
00:15:21,734 --> 00:15:24,134
Let's move on, shall we?

64
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:27,536
I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.

65
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:31,143
- See she takes her Thorazine.
- Sure. I'll take care of it.

66
00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:46,817
It's time to take your meds, Connor.

67
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:48,622
You take it.

68
00:15:48,662 --> 00:15:50,152
Now you know you gotta be good...

69
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:52,061
because you're up for review
this afternoon.

70
00:15:52,097 --> 00:15:55,966
I'm not taking it, Dougie.
I don't want any trouble.

71
00:15:56,002 --> 00:15:57,128
Ain't no trouble.

72
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:04,503
Yeah, zap her.

73
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:17,114
Last call, sugar.

74
00:16:23,097 --> 00:16:25,122
Sweet dreams.

75
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,322
Are you the legal guardian
of John Connor?

76
00:16:57,196 --> 00:17:00,460
That's right, Officer.
What's he done now?

77
00:17:00,498 --> 00:17:03,491
- Could I speak with him, please?
- You could if he were here.

78
00:17:03,535 --> 00:17:06,435
He took off on his bike this morning.
He could be anywhere.

79
00:17:06,471 --> 00:17:08,838
Do you have a photograph of John?

80
00:17:08,874 --> 00:17:10,136
Yeah. Hold on.

81
00:17:12,646 --> 00:17:15,341
Gonna tell me what this is about?

82
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:17,975
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

83
00:17:19,118 --> 00:17:22,986
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?

84
00:17:23,023 --> 00:17:26,549
No, go on. There was a guy here
this morning looking for him too.

85
00:17:26,592 --> 00:17:28,821
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.

86
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:31,329
Has that got something
to do with this?

87
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:37,761
I wouldn't worry about him.

88
00:17:37,803 --> 00:17:40,671
Thanks for your cooperation.

89
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:44,674
Please insert your stolen card now.

90
00:17:51,918 --> 00:17:53,682
PIN number.

91
00:17:54,888 --> 00:17:56,515
Hurry up. This is taking too long.

92
00:17:56,556 --> 00:17:58,080
Go, baby.

93
00:17:59,626 --> 00:18:01,117
All right.

94
00:18:01,162 --> 00:18:04,928
- PIN number 9003.
- Where'd you learn this stuff from?

95
00:18:04,965 --> 00:18:07,490
From my mom.
My real mom, I mean.

96
00:18:07,535 --> 00:18:11,835
Withdraw 300 bucks.

97
00:18:11,872 --> 00:18:14,706
Come on, baby. Come on!

98
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:17,040
- Yes!
- Hey, it worked.

99
00:18:17,078 --> 00:18:21,206
All right. Easy money.
Come on!

100
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:25,374
Yes! Piece of cake.

101
00:18:30,621 --> 00:18:33,784
- Is that her?
- Yes.

102
00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:35,725
She's pretty cool, huh?

103
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,057
No, she's a complete psycho.

104
00:18:38,096 --> 00:18:40,826
That's why she's at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute.

105
00:18:42,534 --> 00:18:45,628
She tried to blow up a computer factory
but got shot and arrested.

106
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,762
No shit.

107
00:18:48,472 --> 00:18:50,905
She's a total loser.

108
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:53,671
Come on.
Let's go spend some money.

109
00:19:19,903 --> 00:19:21,769
Sarah...

110
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,675
Sarah, wake up.

111
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,478
Kyle.

112
00:19:36,222 --> 00:19:37,587
You're dead.

113
00:19:37,623 --> 00:19:39,681
Where's our son, Sarah?

114
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:42,958
They took him away from me.

115
00:19:42,994 --> 00:19:46,225
- He's the target now.
- I know.

116
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:48,392
He's all alone
and you have to protect him.

117
00:19:48,434 --> 00:19:50,903
I know.

118
00:19:50,936 --> 00:19:53,564
You tell me
how I'm supposed to do that.

119
00:19:53,607 --> 00:19:55,802
He doesn't even believe me anymore.

120
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:59,903
- I've lost him.
- You're strong, Sarah.

121
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:02,436
Stronger than you ever thought
you could be.

122
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:04,907
On your feet, soldier!

123
00:20:06,953 --> 00:20:08,420
I love you, Sarah.

124
00:20:08,455 --> 00:20:10,752
I always will.

125
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:13,218
I need you.

126
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:14,989
I'll always be with you.

127
00:20:18,864 --> 00:20:22,392
Remember the message?

128
00:20:22,436 --> 00:20:24,301
The future is not set.

129
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,006
There is no fate
but what we make for ourselves.

130
00:20:48,995 --> 00:20:50,964
Stay with me.

131
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,768
There's not much time left
in the world, Sarah.

132
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:04,033
Kyle, don't go!

133
00:21:16,189 --> 00:21:18,215
Kyle!

134
00:22:29,698 --> 00:22:33,692
<i>It's like a giant strobe light...</i>

135
00:22:33,736 --> 00:22:36,101
<i>burning right through my eyes.</i>

136
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:42,601
<i>Somehow I can still see.</i>

137
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:50,282
<i>Oh, God.</i>

138
00:22:53,723 --> 00:22:57,222
<i>We know the dream's the same
every night.</i>

139
00:22:57,257 --> 00:23:00,658
<i>- Why do I have to-
- Please continue.</i>

140
00:23:04,364 --> 00:23:07,128
<i>Children look like burnt paper.</i>

141
00:23:08,735 --> 00:23:10,897
<i>Black.</i>

142
00:23:10,938 --> 00:23:12,906
<i>Not moving.</i>

143
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:17,143
<i>And then the blast wave hits them.</i>

144
00:23:26,421 --> 00:23:29,151
<i>And they fly apart like leaves.</i>

145
00:23:30,858 --> 00:23:32,019
<i>Dreams...</i>

146
00:23:32,061 --> 00:23:34,290
<i>of cataclysm,
the end of the world...</i>

147
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,297
<i>are very common.</i>

148
00:23:37,966 --> 00:23:42,232
<i>It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.</i>

149
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:46,263
<i>- I know the date it happens.
- I'm sure it feels real to you.</i>

150
00:23:46,308 --> 00:23:48,834
<i>On August 29, 1997...</i>

151
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:52,438
<i>it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin'real to you too!</i>

152
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:57,145
<i>Anybody not wearing two-million
sunblock is gonna have a real bad day.</i>

153
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,211
<i>Get it?</i>

154
00:23:58,253 --> 00:24:01,154
<i>God, you think
you're safe and alive.</i>

155
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,522
<i>You're already dead. Everybody!</i>

156
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:06,120
<i>Him. You. You're dead already.</i>

157
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:09,097
<i>This whole place,
everything you see is gone!</i>

158
00:24:09,131 --> 00:24:13,227
<i>You're the one living in the dream,
'cause I know it happened!</i>

159
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:15,236
<i>It happened!</i>

160
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:29,276
I feel much better now.

161
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:31,253
Clearer.

162
00:24:31,286 --> 00:24:34,120
Yes, your attitude has been...

163
00:24:34,156 --> 00:24:36,489
much improved lately.

164
00:24:45,768 --> 00:24:48,294
It's helped me to have a goal...

165
00:24:48,338 --> 00:24:51,603
something to look forward to.

166
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,801
What is that?

167
00:24:52,841 --> 00:24:55,242
Well, you said...

168
00:24:55,277 --> 00:24:59,180
that if I showed improvement
after six months...

169
00:24:59,214 --> 00:25:01,912
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing...

170
00:25:01,951 --> 00:25:04,749
and I could have visitors.

171
00:25:06,356 --> 00:25:08,916
Well, it's been six months...

172
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:10,426
and...

173
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:13,827
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

174
00:25:14,864 --> 00:25:16,833
I see.

175
00:25:19,537 --> 00:25:23,769
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

176
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:28,346
Now you think they don't exist?

177
00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:30,780
They don't exist.

178
00:25:30,816 --> 00:25:32,546
I know that now.

179
00:25:32,584 --> 00:25:35,781
But you've told me on many occasions
about how you crushed one...

180
00:25:35,821 --> 00:25:37,948
in a hydraulic press.

181
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:42,453
If I had, there would have
been some evidence.

182
00:25:42,493 --> 00:25:44,961
They would have found something
at the factory.

183
00:25:44,996 --> 00:25:47,156
I see.

184
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:50,635
So you don't believe anymore
that the company covered it up?

185
00:25:52,903 --> 00:25:55,805
No. Why would they?

186
00:25:55,842 --> 00:25:59,135
Let's try a new position
right there.

187
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,387
Mr. Dyson?

188
00:26:12,424 --> 00:26:15,086
The materials team
is running another-

189
00:26:15,128 --> 00:26:16,821
- Mr. Dyson.
- Yes?

190
00:26:16,862 --> 00:26:19,888
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

191
00:26:19,932 --> 00:26:22,924
You have to sign for the- it.

192
00:26:22,969 --> 00:26:25,835
- You have to sign it out.
- Okay. I'll get it.

193
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:31,871
I know I haven't been here long,
but I was wondering if you know-

194
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,310
Know what?

195
00:26:33,346 --> 00:26:36,040
If you know where "it" came from.

196
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:39,539
I asked them the same question once.
You know what they told me?

197
00:26:39,584 --> 00:26:41,552
Don't ask.

198
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:50,519
- Good morning, Mr. Dyson.
- How's it going?

199
00:26:50,563 --> 00:26:53,555
Insert key.
Left on three.

200
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,966
Two, one, turn.

201
00:26:59,005 --> 00:27:02,236
- How are the wife and kids?
- Great. Thanks.

202
00:27:29,336 --> 00:27:32,504
So what do you think, Doctor?

203
00:27:33,373 --> 00:27:35,508
I have shown improvement,
haven't I?

204
00:27:36,577 --> 00:27:39,410
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

205
00:27:40,481 --> 00:27:42,948
I know how smart you are.

206
00:27:42,983 --> 00:27:45,008
You're just telling me
what I want to hear.

207
00:27:46,054 --> 00:27:49,148
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

208
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:53,091
If I put you in minimum security,
you'll just try to escape again.

209
00:27:57,933 --> 00:28:00,263
You have to let me see my son.

210
00:28:01,469 --> 00:28:03,096
Please.

211
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:10,272
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

212
00:28:11,646 --> 00:28:13,136
If I could make a phone call-

213
00:28:13,181 --> 00:28:15,672
I'm afraid not.
Not for a while.

214
00:28:17,885 --> 00:28:20,376
I don't see any choice but to
recommend to the review board...

215
00:28:20,421 --> 00:28:22,982
that you stay here
for another six months.

216
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,459
I'll kill you,
you son of a bitch!

217
00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:32,466
You son of a bitch!

218
00:28:33,934 --> 00:28:37,838
Ten CCs of sodium amobarbital, stat!

219
00:28:37,873 --> 00:28:39,396
You don't know what you're doing!

220
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,601
Get some restraints in here now!

221
00:28:42,744 --> 00:28:46,374
You don't know what you're doing!

222
00:28:50,152 --> 00:28:52,517
<i>Model citizen.</i>

223
00:29:31,494 --> 00:29:34,258
You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

224
00:29:34,298 --> 00:29:37,528
- He was going to the Galleria.
- Yeah.

225
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,364
The Galleria?

226
00:30:24,548 --> 00:30:27,778
I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right?

227
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:45,535
- Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?

228
00:30:49,241 --> 00:30:52,039
Hey, do you know this guy?

229
00:30:52,078 --> 00:30:54,273
Nah, I don't know him.

230
00:30:59,585 --> 00:31:02,019
- John.
- Not now.

231
00:31:02,053 --> 00:31:05,353
There's this cop scoping for you.
Check it out.

232
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,828
- He's right over there.
- Split, man.

233
00:31:09,862 --> 00:31:12,353
- Just go.
- Yeah.

234
00:31:17,036 --> 00:31:18,298
I saw that kid-

235
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,588
You're not supposed to
be in here!

236
00:32:01,281 --> 00:32:02,510
Get down.

237
00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:15,449
Mister, are you all right?

238
00:33:16,624 --> 00:33:17,819
You all right?

239
00:33:33,074 --> 00:33:34,337
Come on!

240
00:34:14,184 --> 00:34:15,651
Goddamn!

241
00:38:54,738 --> 00:38:57,503
Okay, time-out.
Stop the bike.

242
00:38:57,541 --> 00:39:00,169
Time out.
Come on, stop the bike.

243
00:39:13,224 --> 00:39:15,987
Holy shit.
Now, don't take this the wrong way.

244
00:39:16,026 --> 00:39:18,460
- You are a Terminator, right?
- Yes.

245
00:39:18,494 --> 00:39:21,329
Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.

246
00:39:32,909 --> 00:39:34,878
Holy shit.

247
00:39:36,347 --> 00:39:38,974
You're really real.

248
00:39:39,015 --> 00:39:40,984
I mean-

249
00:39:43,454 --> 00:39:46,480
You're like a machine underneath,
right?

250
00:39:46,524 --> 00:39:48,048
But alive outside?

251
00:39:48,092 --> 00:39:50,060
I'm a cybernetic organism.

252
00:39:50,094 --> 00:39:52,824
Living tissue
over metal endoskeleton.

253
00:40:07,612 --> 00:40:09,842
This is intense.

254
00:40:09,881 --> 00:40:12,679
Get a grip, John. Okay.

255
00:40:15,253 --> 00:40:17,415
You're not here to kill me.

256
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:21,450
I figured that part out for myself.
So what's the deal?

257
00:40:21,494 --> 00:40:24,256
My mission is to protect you.

258
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,958
Yeah? Who sent you?

259
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:29,327
You did.

260
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:31,598
35 years from now,
you reprogrammed me...

261
00:40:31,636 --> 00:40:33,893
to be your protector here,
in this time.

262
00:40:34,504 --> 00:40:37,370
Oh, this is deep.

263
00:40:59,629 --> 00:41:02,324
So this other guy, he's
a Terminator like you, right?

264
00:41:02,365 --> 00:41:06,461
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.

265
00:41:08,037 --> 00:41:09,868
More advanced than you are?

266
00:41:09,906 --> 00:41:12,602
Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.

267
00:41:12,643 --> 00:41:14,473
What the hell does that mean?

268
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,479
Liquid metal.

269
00:41:17,513 --> 00:41:18,811
Where are we going?

270
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:21,715
We have to get out of the city
immediately and avoid the authorities.

271
00:41:22,285 --> 00:41:25,048
I gotta stop by my house.
I wanna pick up some stuff.

272
00:41:25,086 --> 00:41:29,886
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely
try to reacquire you there.

273
00:41:29,925 --> 00:41:32,728
- You sure?
- I would.

274
00:41:43,305 --> 00:41:46,001
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

275
00:41:48,243 --> 00:41:49,733
but I gotta warn 'em.

276
00:41:49,778 --> 00:41:52,213
Shit. You got a quarter?

277
00:42:00,925 --> 00:42:03,984
<i>- Hello.
- Janelle, it's me.</i>

278
00:42:04,027 --> 00:42:06,427
<i>- John?
- Is everything all right?</i>

279
00:42:06,461 --> 00:42:08,931
<i>- Are you guys okay?
- Sure, honey, everything's okay.</i>

280
00:42:08,966 --> 00:42:12,093
<i>- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

281
00:42:12,135 --> 00:42:15,763
John, it's late.
I was beginning to worry about you.

282
00:42:15,804 --> 00:42:18,535
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

283
00:42:18,575 --> 00:42:20,167
I'm making beef stew.

284
00:42:20,211 --> 00:42:23,202
Something's wrong.
She's never this nice.

285
00:42:23,246 --> 00:42:25,042
Where are you?

286
00:42:25,081 --> 00:42:28,016
What the hell is
the goddamn dog barking at?

287
00:42:28,052 --> 00:42:31,350
Hey, shut up,
you worthless piece of shit!

288
00:42:31,387 --> 00:42:32,945
The dog's really barking.

289
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:35,219
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that mutt.

290
00:42:39,063 --> 00:42:41,860
John, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

291
00:42:41,898 --> 00:42:43,628
Could he already be there?

292
00:42:44,766 --> 00:42:46,132
Are you okay?

293
00:42:46,169 --> 00:42:50,196
<i>- I'm right here. I'm fine.
- Are you sure you're all right?</i>

294
00:42:50,241 --> 00:42:53,574
- What's the dog's name?
- Max.

295
00:42:53,611 --> 00:42:56,044
Hey, Janelle.
What's wrong with Wolfie?

296
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,707
I can hear him barking.
Is he okay?

297
00:42:58,749 --> 00:43:02,652
Wolfie's fine, honey.
Wolfie's just fine.

298
00:43:02,686 --> 00:43:04,414
Where are you?

299
00:43:05,956 --> 00:43:07,082
Your foster parents are dead.

300
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,955
I need a minute here.

301
00:43:46,998 --> 00:43:51,367
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

302
00:43:51,404 --> 00:43:54,372
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

303
00:43:54,407 --> 00:43:55,897
Get real.

304
00:43:55,942 --> 00:43:59,741
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

305
00:43:59,779 --> 00:44:01,746
No, only an object
of equal size.

306
00:44:01,781 --> 00:44:04,381
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

307
00:44:04,448 --> 00:44:06,472
It can't form complex machines.

308
00:44:06,516 --> 00:44:09,143
Guns and explosives
have chemicals, moving parts.

309
00:44:09,184 --> 00:44:10,583
It doesn't work that way.

310
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:13,282
- But it can form solid metal shapes.
- Like what?

311
00:44:13,323 --> 00:44:15,450
Knives and stabbing weapons.

312
00:44:46,022 --> 00:44:48,490
These were taken by
a video surveillance camera...

313
00:44:48,526 --> 00:44:52,121
at the West Highland Police Station
in 1984.

314
00:44:53,397 --> 00:44:56,389
He killed 17 police officers
that night.

315
00:44:57,935 --> 00:44:59,902
Men with families...

316
00:45:01,438 --> 00:45:02,906
children.

317
00:45:04,507 --> 00:45:06,873
These were taken at a mall
in Reseda...

318
00:45:06,911 --> 00:45:08,606
today.

319
00:45:10,314 --> 00:45:13,857
Miss Connor, we know you know
who this guy is.

320
00:45:16,286 --> 00:45:20,746
Look, I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing...

321
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:23,692
that the foster parents
have been murdered.

322
00:45:23,727 --> 00:45:25,423
We know this guy's involved.

323
00:45:26,529 --> 00:45:29,897
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

324
00:45:34,738 --> 00:45:36,228
We're wasting our time.

325
00:45:36,273 --> 00:45:38,434
Let's go.

326
00:45:38,475 --> 00:45:41,071
Sorry, guys.

327
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:45,413
She's grown more disconnected
from reality as time goes on.

328
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:47,747
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

329
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:51,051
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

330
00:45:51,089 --> 00:45:52,681
Sure.

331
00:45:52,724 --> 00:45:55,782
Douglas, take her back to her room.

332
00:45:55,826 --> 00:45:56,952
Yes, sir.

333
00:45:58,562 --> 00:46:00,655
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

334
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:02,859
You see...

335
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,132
we spent a lot of time in Nicaragua
and places like that.

336
00:46:07,304 --> 00:46:11,742
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy...

337
00:46:11,778 --> 00:46:13,176
running guns.

338
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:16,203
Then there were some other guys.

339
00:46:16,249 --> 00:46:18,274
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from...

340
00:46:18,316 --> 00:46:21,548
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

341
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,380
Then she gets busted.

342
00:46:25,422 --> 00:46:29,051
It's like, "Sorry, kid, your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?"

343
00:46:31,263 --> 00:46:35,166
Like everything I've been brought up
to believe is all made-up bullshit.

344
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,896
I hated her for that.

345
00:46:41,107 --> 00:46:43,837
But everything she said was true.

346
00:46:45,111 --> 00:46:47,078
She knew...

347
00:46:49,215 --> 00:46:51,341
and nobody believed her...

348
00:46:53,051 --> 00:46:55,019
not even me.

349
00:46:56,922 --> 00:46:58,856
Listen. We gotta get her
out of there.

350
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:02,257
Negative. The T-1000's highest
probability for success now...

351
00:47:02,295 --> 00:47:05,388
will be to copy Sarah Connor and wait
for you to make contact with her.

352
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:07,557
Great. What happens to her?

353
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,535
Typically, the subject being copied
is terminated.

354
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:13,835
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

355
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:16,000
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.

356
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:18,238
Fuck you!
She's a priority to me!

357
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,106
Goddamn it!
What's your problem? Help!

358
00:47:24,151 --> 00:47:26,015
This does not help our mission.

359
00:47:26,053 --> 00:47:28,544
Get this psycho off of me!
Help!

360
00:47:28,589 --> 00:47:31,683
I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

361
00:47:31,725 --> 00:47:32,783
Let me go!

362
00:47:37,297 --> 00:47:39,128
Why did you do that?

363
00:47:39,167 --> 00:47:41,100
Because you told me to.

364
00:47:43,904 --> 00:47:45,370
What?

365
00:47:50,377 --> 00:47:52,402
You have to do what I say?

366
00:47:52,446 --> 00:47:54,711
That's one of my mission parameters.

367
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:59,477
Prove it.
Stand on one foot.

368
00:48:01,521 --> 00:48:03,045
Yes!

369
00:48:05,192 --> 00:48:08,822
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

370
00:48:10,265 --> 00:48:11,596
You okay, kid?

371
00:48:11,634 --> 00:48:13,064
Take a hike, bozo.

372
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,729
Let's get outta here, man.

373
00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:17,669
Fuck you, you little dipshit!

374
00:48:18,405 --> 00:48:19,872
Dipshit?

375
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:24,170
Put your leg down.

376
00:48:24,211 --> 00:48:29,082
<i>- Did you call moi a dipshit?
- Just trying to help this punk.</i>

377
00:48:29,117 --> 00:48:31,483
Grab this guy.

378
00:48:32,655 --> 00:48:34,315
Get him off of me!

379
00:48:34,354 --> 00:48:36,482
Now who's the dipshit...

380
00:48:36,524 --> 00:48:38,321
you jock douche bag?

381
00:48:47,402 --> 00:48:49,893
Put the gun down now!

382
00:48:49,938 --> 00:48:53,203
- Get outta here!
- Come on. Let's split!

383
00:49:00,115 --> 00:49:02,106
You were gonna kill that guy!

384
00:49:02,151 --> 00:49:04,312
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

385
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:09,183
Listen to me very carefully, okay?

386
00:49:09,224 --> 00:49:12,625
You're not a Terminator anymore,
all right?

387
00:49:12,661 --> 00:49:15,095
You got that?

388
00:49:15,131 --> 00:49:17,462
You just can't go around
killing people.

389
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,524
Why?

390
00:49:19,502 --> 00:49:21,662
What do you mean, why?
'Cause you can't.

391
00:49:22,738 --> 00:49:25,572
Because you just can't.
Trust me on this.

392
00:49:31,582 --> 00:49:35,074
Look. I'm gonna go get my mom.

393
00:49:35,118 --> 00:49:37,984
I order you to help me.

394
00:52:05,505 --> 00:52:07,973
You have a Sarah Connor here?

395
00:52:08,007 --> 00:52:09,669
You're runnin' kind of late.

396
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:12,200
They've been in there for an hour.

397
00:52:12,245 --> 00:52:14,680
Hold on a second.
I'll buzz you in.

398
00:52:16,415 --> 00:52:20,317
Oh, here come your friends now.

399
00:53:22,083 --> 00:53:25,575
- Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

400
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:28,612
- How 'bout a beer?
- Yeah, right.

401
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,746
- Hey, I got a full house.
- That's good, Louis.

402
00:53:55,784 --> 00:53:58,116
Must be my lucky day.

403
00:56:20,864 --> 00:56:23,389
You're right about number 24.

404
00:56:23,433 --> 00:56:26,460
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

405
00:56:26,503 --> 00:56:29,403
- Same kind?
- Mm-hmm.

406
00:56:44,121 --> 00:56:46,555
You!

407
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:51,028
You broke my arm.

408
00:56:51,062 --> 00:56:53,860
There are 215 bones
in the human body.

409
00:56:53,899 --> 00:56:56,527
That's one. Now, don't move.

410
00:57:02,474 --> 00:57:04,134
What are you going to do?

411
00:57:07,678 --> 00:57:09,805
Why do we stop now?

412
00:57:11,048 --> 00:57:14,917
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

413
00:57:14,953 --> 00:57:17,581
- Right.
- Swear?

414
00:57:17,621 --> 00:57:19,146
What?

415
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:22,319
Just put up your hand and say,
"I swear I won't kill anyone. "

416
00:57:23,395 --> 00:57:25,829
I swear I will not kill anyone.

417
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:28,889
All right. Let's go.

418
00:57:34,472 --> 00:57:36,497
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00...

419
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,839
Monday through Friday.

420
00:57:42,514 --> 00:57:43,777
What the hell are you doing?

421
00:57:43,815 --> 00:57:46,443
You son of a bitch!
You shot me!

422
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:49,585
Crazy bastard!

423
00:57:53,824 --> 00:57:56,122
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.

424
00:57:59,665 --> 00:58:01,632
He'll live.

425
00:58:16,082 --> 00:58:18,277
Son of a bitch!

426
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,051
Let's try to remain calm.

427
00:58:21,087 --> 00:58:23,056
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

428
00:58:23,089 --> 00:58:25,182
There's no way, Connor.
Let him go.

429
00:58:25,225 --> 00:58:27,785
- Open the door.
- It ain't gonna happen.

430
00:58:27,828 --> 00:58:29,728
Take it easy, Sarah.

431
00:58:29,763 --> 00:58:32,926
It won't work. You're no killer.
I don't believe you can do it.

432
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:35,993
You're already dead. Everybody dies.
You know I believe it.

433
00:58:36,036 --> 00:58:38,095
So don't fuck with me!

434
00:58:38,138 --> 00:58:39,867
Open the door!

435
00:58:46,681 --> 00:58:48,375
Back off!

436
00:58:48,415 --> 00:58:49,881
Get back!

437
00:58:49,916 --> 00:58:51,883
I'll pump him full of this shit.
I swear!

438
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:55,313
Don't move!

439
00:58:56,423 --> 00:58:57,651
Drop the shit!

440
00:58:57,691 --> 00:58:59,591
Do it!

441
00:58:59,627 --> 00:59:01,594
Get in the office.

442
00:59:01,629 --> 00:59:03,721
On the floor, face down.
Not you!

443
00:59:03,764 --> 00:59:05,493
Open the door.

444
00:59:08,302 --> 00:59:09,769
On the floor. Hold it open.

445
00:59:09,805 --> 00:59:11,772
Face the wall!

446
00:59:27,722 --> 00:59:29,587
Get her!

447
00:59:57,285 --> 01:00:00,278
Hurry up! Open the door!
The door's locked!

448
01:00:01,355 --> 01:00:03,256
Let's go! Open it!

449
01:00:05,695 --> 01:00:07,720
- She broke it off.
- Open it!

450
01:00:13,102 --> 01:00:15,435
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it!

451
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:48,696
Mom, wait!

452
01:00:55,478 --> 01:00:56,536
Come back here!

453
01:01:01,151 --> 01:01:02,812
- Help her!
- Wait here.

454
01:01:02,853 --> 01:01:05,447
- Hurry up!
- He'll kill us all!

455
01:01:06,722 --> 01:01:07,985
Hold her.

456
01:01:09,526 --> 01:01:10,686
He'll kill us all!

457
01:01:32,884 --> 01:01:35,249
Mom, are you okay? Mom!

458
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:42,158
Come with me
if you want to live.

459
01:01:42,193 --> 01:01:44,753
It's okay, Mom.
He's here to help.

460
01:02:09,422 --> 01:02:10,513
Go.

461
01:02:42,822 --> 01:02:45,382
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

462
01:03:00,106 --> 01:03:02,006
Get down.

463
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:39,469
Out of the car!

464
01:03:40,847 --> 01:03:42,041
Right now!

465
01:04:06,474 --> 01:04:07,499
Go!

466
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:19,980
I'm out.

467
01:04:26,794 --> 01:04:28,694
- Come on.
- Here.

468
01:04:31,232 --> 01:04:33,326
Reload.

469
01:04:42,244 --> 01:04:44,236
Last one!

470
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:53,011
Hang on.

471
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:20,772
Ready!

472
01:05:34,464 --> 01:05:36,398
Here, drive.

473
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:31,885
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

474
01:06:31,924 --> 01:06:33,891
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

475
01:06:36,361 --> 01:06:37,487
Can you see anything?

476
01:06:38,696 --> 01:06:39,924
I see everything.

477
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,427
Cool.

478
01:06:48,039 --> 01:06:50,006
Come here.

479
01:06:55,714 --> 01:06:57,511
I said I was okay.

480
01:06:58,316 --> 01:07:01,410
John, it was stupid of you
to go there.

481
01:07:02,386 --> 01:07:04,685
You have to be smarter
than that.

482
01:07:04,723 --> 01:07:06,349
You were almost killed.

483
01:07:07,558 --> 01:07:09,288
What were you thinking?

484
01:07:10,194 --> 01:07:12,857
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me.

485
01:07:12,898 --> 01:07:14,456
Do you understand?

486
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,057
You're too important.

487
01:07:16,101 --> 01:07:18,763
Do you understand?

488
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,766
But...

489
01:07:24,443 --> 01:07:28,209
I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.

490
01:07:28,814 --> 01:07:31,510
I didn't need your help.

491
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:40,612
What's wrong with your eyes?

492
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:44,057
Nothing.

493
01:07:53,936 --> 01:07:56,427
So, what's your story?

494
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:08,074
You okay?

495
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:09,584
Fine.

496
01:08:11,387 --> 01:08:14,686
Say, that's a nice bike.

497
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,942
Watch it, lug nuts.

498
01:08:46,423 --> 01:08:49,859
Listen, do you know
what you're doing?

499
01:08:49,893 --> 01:08:52,692
I have detailed files
on human anatomy.

500
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,621
I bet.

501
01:08:55,664 --> 01:08:58,690
Makes you a more efficient killer,
right?

502
01:08:58,735 --> 01:08:59,860
Correct.

503
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:07,910
Does it hurt
when you get shot?

504
01:09:08,979 --> 01:09:12,437
I sense injuries.
The data could be called "pain. "

505
01:09:14,786 --> 01:09:16,753
John, help me with the light.

506
01:09:16,788 --> 01:09:19,119
- Will these heal up?
- Yes.

507
01:09:19,157 --> 01:09:23,388
Good. If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.

508
01:09:23,426 --> 01:09:26,555
How long do you live?
I mean, last. Whatever.

509
01:09:26,596 --> 01:09:29,566
A hundred and twenty years
with my existing power cell.

510
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,569
Can you learn stuff that you
haven't been programmed with...

511
01:09:32,603 --> 01:09:34,070
so you can be...

512
01:09:35,274 --> 01:09:38,037
you know, more human...

513
01:09:38,075 --> 01:09:40,840
and not such a dork
all the time?

514
01:09:43,981 --> 01:09:47,543
My CPU is a neural net processor,
a learning computer.

515
01:09:47,586 --> 01:09:51,954
But Skynet presets the switch
to read-only when we're sent out alone.

516
01:09:53,292 --> 01:09:55,759
Doesn't want you to do
too much thinking, huh?

517
01:09:55,793 --> 01:09:57,125
No.

518
01:09:58,697 --> 01:10:00,961
Can we reset the switch?

519
01:10:18,983 --> 01:10:23,478
Rotate the two locking cylinders
counterclockwise.

520
01:10:29,329 --> 01:10:30,852
Do it.

521
01:10:39,005 --> 01:10:41,496
Now open the port cover.

522
01:10:44,009 --> 01:10:46,603
<i>Pull to break the seal.</i>

523
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:53,708
<i>Good, now remove
the shock-damping assembly.</i>

524
01:10:57,222 --> 01:10:59,713
You can now access the CPU.

525
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:02,889
<i>- Do you see it?
- Yes.</i>

526
01:11:02,929 --> 01:11:06,888
Hold the CPU by its base tab.

527
01:11:06,933 --> 01:11:08,366
<i>Pull.</i>

528
01:11:45,739 --> 01:11:47,502
Do you see the pin switch?

529
01:11:47,541 --> 01:11:49,441
No! No!

530
01:11:50,412 --> 01:11:53,073
- Out of my way, John.
- Don't kill him.

531
01:11:53,114 --> 01:11:56,447
<i>It, John, not him.
It.</i>

532
01:11:56,484 --> 01:12:00,011
<i>Okay, 'It'.
But we need 'It'.</i>

533
01:12:00,055 --> 01:12:02,717
Listen to me.
You listen.

534
01:12:02,757 --> 01:12:04,918
We're better-off on our own.

535
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,825
But he's the only proof we have...

536
01:12:06,861 --> 01:12:09,385
of the future and the war
and all that.

537
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:10,863
Maybe.

538
01:12:13,435 --> 01:12:15,528
I don't trust it.

539
01:12:15,569 --> 01:12:17,265
But he's my friend, all right?

540
01:12:18,105 --> 01:12:20,938
You don't know what it's like
to try to kill one of these things...

541
01:12:20,976 --> 01:12:24,571
and if something goes wrong
this could be our last chance, so move!

542
01:12:24,612 --> 01:12:26,739
If I'm ever supposed to be this
great military leader...

543
01:12:26,781 --> 01:12:30,649
maybe you should start listening
to my leadership ideas once in a while.

544
01:12:33,622 --> 01:12:35,418
Because if my own mother won't...

545
01:12:35,458 --> 01:12:38,289
how do you expect anyone else to?

546
01:12:52,475 --> 01:12:55,568
All right, play it your way.

547
01:13:02,985 --> 01:13:05,078
Was there a problem?

548
01:13:05,121 --> 01:13:06,645
No problem.

549
01:13:08,324 --> 01:13:09,587
None whatsoever.

550
01:13:43,217 --> 01:13:45,185
Are we learning yet?

551
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,567
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

552
01:14:04,271 --> 01:14:05,898
Just head south.

553
01:14:14,648 --> 01:14:16,276
Keep it under 65.

554
01:14:16,316 --> 01:14:19,286
- We don't want to be pulled over.
- Affirmative.

555
01:14:22,523 --> 01:14:25,050
You gotta listen to the way
people talk.

556
01:14:25,094 --> 01:14:28,654
You don't say "affirmative"
or some shit like that.

557
01:14:28,696 --> 01:14:30,993
<i>You say, "No problemo".</i>

558
01:14:31,032 --> 01:14:34,991
If someone comes off to you
with an attitude, you say, "Eat me. "

559
01:14:35,036 --> 01:14:39,336
<i>And if you want to shine them on,
it's "Hasta la vista, baby. "</i>

560
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:42,103
<i>Hasta la vista, baby.</i>

561
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:44,703
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad".

562
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:47,807
If someone gets upset,
you say, "Chill out".

563
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:49,316
Or you can do combinations.

564
01:14:50,019 --> 01:14:52,351
Chill out, dick-wad.

565
01:14:53,154 --> 01:14:55,179
That's great.
See? You're getting it.

566
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:56,315
<i>No problemo.</i>

567
01:15:07,334 --> 01:15:09,301
You got any cash?

568
01:15:09,336 --> 01:15:12,931
I got a couple hundred bucks.
I'll give you half.

569
01:15:12,973 --> 01:15:14,667
Mom!

570
01:15:15,809 --> 01:15:17,834
Get some food.

571
01:15:19,813 --> 01:15:22,336
No sense of humor.

572
01:15:27,486 --> 01:15:31,253
That's another thing.
You can lighten up a bit yourself.

573
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:34,355
This severe routine
is getting old, okay.

574
01:15:34,394 --> 01:15:36,294
I mean, you're acting
like such a geek.

575
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:38,356
Smile once in a while.

576
01:15:38,398 --> 01:15:39,797
Smile?

577
01:15:39,833 --> 01:15:43,793
Yeah, you know, smile.
Watch.

578
01:15:44,771 --> 01:15:48,502
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?

579
01:15:49,408 --> 01:15:51,308
Give me a break.

580
01:15:52,179 --> 01:15:54,204
Okay, bad example.

581
01:15:55,315 --> 01:15:57,010
See that guy over there?

582
01:15:57,049 --> 01:15:58,983
That's a smile.

583
01:16:18,305 --> 01:16:19,795
That's good.

584
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:23,674
Maybe you could practice
in front of a mirror or something.

585
01:16:30,051 --> 01:16:32,020
Want some of my fries?

586
01:16:41,996 --> 01:16:43,965
Need any help?

587
01:16:43,998 --> 01:16:45,694
No.

588
01:16:45,734 --> 01:16:47,599
- I got you!
- No, you didn't!

589
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:59,108
We're not gonna make it,
are we?

590
01:17:00,984 --> 01:17:02,246
People, I mean.

591
01:17:05,021 --> 01:17:07,251
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

592
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:11,260
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

593
01:17:12,393 --> 01:17:13,793
Break it up before I wring
both of your necks.

594
01:17:16,329 --> 01:17:19,458
I need to know
how Skynet gets built.

595
01:17:19,499 --> 01:17:20,797
Who's responsible?

596
01:17:20,834 --> 01:17:24,430
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

597
01:17:24,471 --> 01:17:26,234
Who is that?

598
01:17:26,273 --> 01:17:30,232
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

599
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:34,777
Why him?

600
01:17:34,815 --> 01:17:38,216
In a few months he creates
a revolutionary type of microprocessor.

601
01:17:39,251 --> 01:17:40,617
Go on. Then what?

602
01:17:41,689 --> 01:17:44,658
In three years, Cyberdyne will become
the largest supplier...

603
01:17:44,691 --> 01:17:46,125
of military computer systems.

604
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:50,130
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers...

605
01:17:50,163 --> 01:17:51,654
becoming fully unmanned.

606
01:17:51,699 --> 01:17:54,793
Afterwards they fly with
a perfect operational record.

607
01:17:54,835 --> 01:17:57,531
The Skynet funding bill is passed.

608
01:17:57,572 --> 01:18:00,871
The system goes on-line
on August 4, 1997.

609
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:04,139
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defense.

610
01:18:04,178 --> 01:18:06,942
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

611
01:18:06,981 --> 01:18:11,315
It becomes self-aware
at 2:14 a. m. Eastern time, August 29.

612
01:18:12,353 --> 01:18:14,981
In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.

613
01:18:16,089 --> 01:18:18,355
- Skynet fights back.
- Yes.

614
01:18:18,393 --> 01:18:21,190
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

615
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:24,323
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

616
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:26,800
Because Skynet knows
that the Russian counterattack...

617
01:18:26,834 --> 01:18:28,803
will eliminate its enemies
over here.

618
01:18:28,836 --> 01:18:30,805
Jesus.

619
01:18:33,107 --> 01:18:35,076
How much do you know
about Dyson?

620
01:18:37,178 --> 01:18:39,146
I have detailed files.

621
01:18:40,316 --> 01:18:42,283
I want to know everything.

622
01:18:42,518 --> 01:18:44,884
What he looks like,
where he lives, everything.

623
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:00,665
Miles.

624
01:19:03,001 --> 01:19:05,026
<i>Miles.</i>

625
01:19:22,887 --> 01:19:24,685
Are you going to work all day?

626
01:19:24,723 --> 01:19:28,625
I'm sorry, baby.
But this thing is just kicking my ass.

627
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:30,025
Miles, it's Sunday.

628
01:19:30,061 --> 01:19:32,825
You promised to take the kids
to Raging Waters today.

629
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,923
I can't...

630
01:19:36,568 --> 01:19:38,262
I'm on a roll.

631
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:53,381
Baby, this is going
to blow them all away.

632
01:19:53,419 --> 01:19:56,547
- It's a neural net processor.
- I know. You told me.

633
01:19:56,589 --> 01:19:59,785
It's a neural net processor.
It thinks and learns like we do.

634
01:19:59,824 --> 01:20:02,555
It's superconducting
at room temperature.

635
01:20:02,594 --> 01:20:06,860
Other computers are just
pocket calculators by comparison.

636
01:20:08,768 --> 01:20:11,065
But why is that
so goddamn important, Miles?

637
01:20:11,103 --> 01:20:12,468
I really need to know...

638
01:20:12,505 --> 01:20:15,632
because sometimes I feel
like I'm going crazy here.

639
01:20:17,276 --> 01:20:19,301
Baby, I am this close.

640
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:21,403
Come here.

641
01:20:24,017 --> 01:20:26,577
Imagine a jet airliner...

642
01:20:26,619 --> 01:20:29,314
with a pilot that never gets tired,
never makes mistakes...

643
01:20:29,355 --> 01:20:31,255
never shows up to work
with a hangover.

644
01:20:33,627 --> 01:20:36,095
Meet the pilot.

645
01:20:36,129 --> 01:20:39,259
Why did we get married, Miles?
Why did we have these children?

646
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:40,358
You don't need us.

647
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:43,893
Your heart and your mind
are in here.

648
01:20:43,938 --> 01:20:46,839
But it doesn't love you
like we do.

649
01:20:54,982 --> 01:20:57,609
I'm sorry.
Really.

650
01:20:57,651 --> 01:21:01,950
How about spending some time
with your other babies?

651
01:21:04,592 --> 01:21:06,458
<i>Raging Waters!</i>

652
01:21:36,122 --> 01:21:37,384
Wait in the car.

653
01:22:16,263 --> 01:22:17,992
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

654
01:22:38,888 --> 01:22:40,513
Hey, big John.

655
01:22:41,257 --> 01:22:42,314
What's up?

656
01:22:43,724 --> 01:22:44,851
He's cool, Enrique.

657
01:22:44,892 --> 01:22:46,018
He's with me.

658
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:49,257
He's... Uncle Bob.

659
01:22:49,296 --> 01:22:51,423
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

660
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:53,399
Uncle Bob, huh?

661
01:22:54,436 --> 01:22:55,732
Okay.

662
01:23:02,710 --> 01:23:03,733
Drink?

663
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:10,383
"Uncle Bob"?

664
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:15,355
You're pretty famous,
all over the goddamn TV.

665
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:18,086
Pictures of you, John,
your big friend here.

666
01:23:18,126 --> 01:23:21,094
Cops are going nuts
looking for you.

667
01:23:23,898 --> 01:23:28,028
I just came for my stuff.
I need clothes, food and a truck.

668
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:30,038
How about the fillings in my teeth?

669
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:32,266
Now, Enrique.

670
01:23:33,576 --> 01:23:35,806
You two,
you're on weapons detail.

671
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:37,176
Let's go.

672
01:23:58,134 --> 01:24:00,102
One thing about my mom-

673
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:04,340
she always plans ahead.

674
01:24:15,215 --> 01:24:15,545
Excellent.

675
01:24:26,859 --> 01:24:30,555
This is my best truck,
but the starter motor's gone.

676
01:24:30,595 --> 01:24:32,564
You got time to change it out?

677
01:24:32,598 --> 01:24:35,997
Yeah. I'm gonna wait 'til dark
to cross the border.

678
01:24:36,034 --> 01:24:37,558
Enrique.

679
01:24:37,602 --> 01:24:41,197
It's dangerous for you here.
You get out tonight too, okay?

680
01:24:41,239 --> 01:24:43,833
Sure.

681
01:24:43,875 --> 01:24:47,606
Just drop by anytime
and totally fuck up my life, all right?

682
01:24:52,018 --> 01:24:55,577
See, I grew up in places like this...

683
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:58,089
so I just thought
that's how people lived-

684
01:24:59,358 --> 01:25:02,121
riding around in helicopters...

685
01:25:03,161 --> 01:25:05,426
learning how to blow shit up.

686
01:25:06,898 --> 01:25:09,594
But then when my mom got busted...

687
01:25:09,635 --> 01:25:12,034
I got put into a regular school.

688
01:25:12,670 --> 01:25:15,469
All the other kids
were into Nintendo.

689
01:25:29,687 --> 01:25:31,882
Are you ever afraid?

690
01:25:31,923 --> 01:25:34,118
No.

691
01:25:37,096 --> 01:25:38,791
Not even of dying?

692
01:25:39,431 --> 01:25:41,296
No.

693
01:25:45,705 --> 01:25:50,005
You don't feel any emotion about it,
one way or another?

694
01:25:50,043 --> 01:25:54,036
No. I have to stay functional
until my mission is complete.

695
01:25:59,019 --> 01:26:02,182
Then it doesn't matter.

696
01:26:02,222 --> 01:26:05,852
I have to stay functional too.
"I'm too important. "

697
01:26:22,209 --> 01:26:23,971
That's definitely you.

698
01:26:35,288 --> 01:26:37,757
Most of the guys my mom
hung around with were geeks...

699
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:41,918
but there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.

700
01:26:41,959 --> 01:26:43,927
He taught me engines.

701
01:26:43,961 --> 01:26:46,191
Hold here.

702
01:26:46,230 --> 01:26:48,663
Mom screwed it up, of course.

703
01:26:48,699 --> 01:26:51,189
She'd always tell 'em
about Judgment Day...

704
01:26:51,234 --> 01:26:54,067
and me being this world leader.

705
01:26:54,104 --> 01:26:56,072
That'd be all she wrote.

706
01:26:57,407 --> 01:26:58,533
Torque wrench, please.

707
01:27:00,778 --> 01:27:02,039
Here.

708
01:27:02,079 --> 01:27:05,310
I wish I could've met
my real dad.

709
01:27:05,349 --> 01:27:07,146
You will.

710
01:27:07,185 --> 01:27:09,415
Yeah, I guess.

711
01:27:09,453 --> 01:27:13,321
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

712
01:27:13,357 --> 01:27:17,123
They sent him back through time
to 1984.

713
01:27:17,162 --> 01:27:18,628
Man.

714
01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:22,599
He hasn't even been born yet.

715
01:27:24,367 --> 01:27:26,336
It messes with your head.

716
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:32,009
- The other bolt.
- Oh. Here.

717
01:27:38,316 --> 01:27:41,911
Mom and him were only together
for one night.

718
01:27:41,954 --> 01:27:44,445
She still loves him, I guess.

719
01:27:44,489 --> 01:27:47,423
I see her crying sometimes.

720
01:27:47,459 --> 01:27:51,919
She denies it totally, of course,
like she got something stuck in her eye.

721
01:27:56,401 --> 01:27:57,960
Why do you cry?

722
01:27:59,037 --> 01:28:00,561
- You mean people?
- Yeah.

723
01:28:00,606 --> 01:28:02,040
I don't know.

724
01:28:02,074 --> 01:28:04,201
We just cry...

725
01:28:04,243 --> 01:28:06,837
you know, when it hurts.

726
01:28:12,886 --> 01:28:14,683
Pain causes it?

727
01:28:15,721 --> 01:28:17,882
No. It's different.

728
01:28:17,923 --> 01:28:21,257
It's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyway.

729
01:28:21,293 --> 01:28:22,921
- You get it?
- No.

730
01:28:24,162 --> 01:28:25,925
All right, my man!

731
01:28:26,499 --> 01:28:27,523
<i>No problemo.</i>

732
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:29,326
Give me five.

733
01:28:31,371 --> 01:28:33,497
Just put out your hand
like this.

734
01:28:34,841 --> 01:28:39,175
All right! Now hit me.
Give me five. Do the same thing.

735
01:28:43,883 --> 01:28:46,374
Okay, that's good.
Up high.

736
01:28:47,319 --> 01:28:48,651
Five low.

737
01:28:49,389 --> 01:28:50,413
Too slow.

738
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,657
I'm just kidding.
One more time.

739
01:28:55,696 --> 01:28:57,959
Good. Now try it.

740
01:28:57,998 --> 01:28:59,965
Now do me.
Give me five.

741
01:29:01,401 --> 01:29:05,998
<i>Watching John with the machine,
it was suddenly so clear.</i>

742
01:29:06,039 --> 01:29:09,008
<i>The Terminator would never stop.</i>

743
01:29:09,042 --> 01:29:13,036
<i>It would never leave him,
never hurt him...</i>

744
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:16,537
<i>never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him...</i>

745
01:29:16,583 --> 01:29:19,176
<i>or be too busy
to spend time with him.</i>

746
01:29:20,019 --> 01:29:22,181
<i>It would always be there...</i>

747
01:29:22,222 --> 01:29:24,917
<i>and it would die
to protect him.</i>

748
01:29:26,293 --> 01:29:29,693
<i>Of all the would-be fathers
who came and went over the years...</i>

749
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:31,790
<i>this thing, this machine...</i>

750
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:34,232
<i>was the only one
who measured up.</i>

751
01:29:34,969 --> 01:29:36,869
<i>In an insane world...</i>

752
01:29:36,904 --> 01:29:38,872
<i>it was the sanest choice.</i>

753
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:18,608
Hey, let's try this one.

754
01:31:24,214 --> 01:31:26,444
There we go.

755
01:33:12,492 --> 01:33:15,016
She said go south with him
like you planned.

756
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:17,290
- She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom!

757
01:33:19,064 --> 01:33:20,259
Mom, wait!

758
01:33:35,516 --> 01:33:36,983
"No fate. "

759
01:33:38,184 --> 01:33:40,652
No fate but what we make.

760
01:33:42,757 --> 01:33:44,724
My father told her this.

761
01:33:47,328 --> 01:33:51,627
I made him memorize it in the future
as a message to her.

762
01:33:53,267 --> 01:33:55,235
Never mind.

763
01:33:55,269 --> 01:33:58,670
Okay, the whole thing goes-

764
01:33:58,706 --> 01:34:01,436
The future's not set.

765
01:34:01,475 --> 01:34:05,036
There's no fate but what
we make for ourselves.

766
01:34:05,079 --> 01:34:08,139
She intends to change the future.

767
01:34:08,183 --> 01:34:09,649
Yeah, I guess.

768
01:34:11,185 --> 01:34:13,049
Oh, shit!

769
01:34:13,087 --> 01:34:15,054
- Dyson.
- Yeah.

770
01:34:15,089 --> 01:34:18,615
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

771
01:34:18,659 --> 01:34:20,717
She's gonna blow him away.

772
01:34:20,761 --> 01:34:22,820
Come on! Let's go!

773
01:34:35,243 --> 01:34:37,302
This is tactically dangerous.

774
01:34:37,346 --> 01:34:38,471
Drive faster.

775
01:34:38,512 --> 01:34:41,107
The T-1000 has the same files
that I do.

776
01:34:41,148 --> 01:34:44,607
It knows what I know.
It might anticipate this move.

777
01:34:44,653 --> 01:34:47,144
I don't care.
We gotta stop her.

778
01:34:47,188 --> 01:34:49,155
Killing Dyson
might prevent the war.

779
01:34:49,190 --> 01:34:51,055
I don't care!

780
01:34:51,657 --> 01:34:53,453
Haven't you learned anything yet?

781
01:34:53,492 --> 01:34:56,016
Haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?

782
01:34:58,697 --> 01:35:01,291
Look, maybe you don't care
if you live or die...

783
01:35:01,333 --> 01:35:03,528
but everybody's not like that.

784
01:35:03,569 --> 01:35:07,164
We have feelings.
We hurt. We're afraid.

785
01:35:09,676 --> 01:35:13,372
You got to learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. It's important.

786
01:35:50,885 --> 01:35:54,218
Danny, I told you to go to bed,
like your sister.

787
01:35:54,255 --> 01:35:56,553
Just a couple of minutes, Mom!

788
01:36:13,206 --> 01:36:15,607
Danny, your time is up!

789
01:36:15,643 --> 01:36:18,611
Come brush your teeth
and get to bed.

790
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:48,767
Danny!

791
01:37:00,353 --> 01:37:01,752
Daddy!

792
01:37:01,788 --> 01:37:04,279
Danny, go! Go!

793
01:37:05,826 --> 01:37:07,054
Miles?

794
01:37:12,266 --> 01:37:14,734
- Tarissa, run!
- Oh, my God!

795
01:37:21,776 --> 01:37:23,835
Just take Danny and run!

796
01:37:23,878 --> 01:37:25,175
Run!

797
01:37:25,212 --> 01:37:27,009
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

798
01:37:45,866 --> 01:37:46,925
Daddy!

799
01:37:48,570 --> 01:37:50,095
Nobody fucking move!

800
01:37:50,871 --> 01:37:52,170
Don't hurt my daddy!

801
01:37:52,207 --> 01:37:53,798
On the floor, bitch.

802
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:56,036
Get down now!

803
01:37:56,877 --> 01:37:58,003
Get out of the way!

804
01:37:58,045 --> 01:37:59,512
Don't hurt him!

805
01:38:00,981 --> 01:38:03,040
Get on the floor now!

806
01:38:06,054 --> 01:38:07,816
Just let the boy go.

807
01:38:07,855 --> 01:38:09,483
Shut up. Shut up.

808
01:38:09,524 --> 01:38:10,855
Shut up!

809
01:38:10,891 --> 01:38:13,520
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

810
01:38:13,562 --> 01:38:15,859
- It's all your fault!
- What?

811
01:38:15,897 --> 01:38:18,025
I'm not gonna let you do it.

812
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:12,181
Shit! We're too late!

813
01:39:16,625 --> 01:39:17,751
Check them.

814
01:39:21,431 --> 01:39:23,456
Look at me, Mom.

815
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:25,730
Are you hurt?

816
01:39:29,339 --> 01:39:31,432
I almost-

817
01:39:43,053 --> 01:39:45,453
It'll be okay.

818
01:39:45,487 --> 01:39:47,456
We'll figure something out.
Okay?

819
01:39:49,025 --> 01:39:50,720
I promise.

820
01:39:53,963 --> 01:39:56,932
You came here to stop me.

821
01:39:57,801 --> 01:39:59,770
Yeah, I did.

822
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:04,630
I love you, John.

823
01:40:06,310 --> 01:40:07,902
I always have.

824
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:11,247
I know.

825
01:40:18,221 --> 01:40:20,452
Deep penetration.

826
01:40:22,026 --> 01:40:23,993
No shattered bone.

827
01:40:24,028 --> 01:40:26,997
Hold here.
The pressure should stop the bleeding.

828
01:40:37,743 --> 01:40:39,175
Who are you people?

829
01:40:40,111 --> 01:40:41,580
Show him.

830
01:40:44,216 --> 01:40:48,448
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Show me your room.

831
01:41:28,861 --> 01:41:30,158
Oh, my God.

832
01:41:30,197 --> 01:41:32,858
Now listen to me
very carefully.

833
01:41:38,738 --> 01:41:42,901
<i>Dyson listened while the Terminator
laid it all down.</i>

834
01:41:42,942 --> 01:41:46,844
<i>Skynet. Judgment Day.</i>

835
01:41:46,879 --> 01:41:49,212
<i>The history of things to come.</i>

836
01:41:50,616 --> 01:41:53,415
<i>It's not every day that
you find out you're responsible...</i>

837
01:41:53,454 --> 01:41:56,320
<i>for three billion deaths.</i>

838
01:41:56,355 --> 01:41:58,323
<i>He took it pretty well.</i>

839
01:42:00,294 --> 01:42:02,762
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

840
01:42:08,769 --> 01:42:10,929
You're judging me...

841
01:42:10,971 --> 01:42:13,438
on things I haven't even done yet.

842
01:42:17,643 --> 01:42:19,770
How were we supposed to know?

843
01:42:22,217 --> 01:42:24,207
Yeah.

844
01:42:24,251 --> 01:42:26,686
Right.

845
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:28,882
How were you supposed to know?

846
01:42:29,923 --> 01:42:31,789
Fucking men like you...

847
01:42:31,826 --> 01:42:33,657
built the hydrogen bomb.

848
01:42:33,695 --> 01:42:36,322
Men like you...

849
01:42:36,364 --> 01:42:37,831
thought it up.

850
01:42:41,669 --> 01:42:43,637
You think you're so creative.

851
01:42:45,038 --> 01:42:48,168
You don't know what it's like
to really create something...

852
01:42:48,209 --> 01:42:50,404
to create a life...

853
01:42:50,445 --> 01:42:52,004
to feel it growing inside you.

854
01:42:52,046 --> 01:42:55,016
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

855
01:42:55,051 --> 01:42:56,779
Mom!

856
01:42:56,819 --> 01:43:00,619
We need to be a little more
constructive here. Okay?

857
01:43:00,655 --> 01:43:02,782
We still have to stop this
from happening.

858
01:43:02,824 --> 01:43:05,691
But I thought-

859
01:43:05,727 --> 01:43:09,754
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

860
01:43:09,798 --> 01:43:14,667
That's right. There's no way I'm going
to finish the new processor. Not now.

861
01:43:14,702 --> 01:43:18,196
Forget it. I'm out of it.
I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.

862
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:20,175
That's not good enough.

863
01:43:20,209 --> 01:43:22,178
No one must follow your work.

864
01:43:22,211 --> 01:43:24,112
Right.

865
01:43:24,146 --> 01:43:28,549
All right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab-

866
01:43:28,583 --> 01:43:30,211
the files, the disk drives...

867
01:43:30,251 --> 01:43:32,948
everything here.

868
01:43:32,987 --> 01:43:35,080
Everything.

869
01:43:35,123 --> 01:43:37,092
I don't care.

870
01:43:38,327 --> 01:43:39,385
The chip.

871
01:43:39,428 --> 01:43:41,555
- Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

872
01:43:41,597 --> 01:43:44,065
It's at Cyberdyne.
It's from the other one like you.

873
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:46,863
The CPU from the first Terminator.

874
01:43:46,902 --> 01:43:49,337
Son of a bitch!
I knew it!

875
01:43:49,372 --> 01:43:52,135
They told us not to ask
where they got it.

876
01:43:52,173 --> 01:43:54,539
Those lying motherfuckers.

877
01:43:54,576 --> 01:43:56,408
It's scary stuff.
Radically advanced.

878
01:43:56,444 --> 01:43:57,639
It was smashed.

879
01:43:57,680 --> 01:44:01,343
It didn't work, but it gave us ideas,
took us in new directions.

880
01:44:01,384 --> 01:44:03,408
Things we would've never-

881
01:44:05,554 --> 01:44:07,681
All my work was based on it.

882
01:44:07,723 --> 01:44:09,554
It must be destroyed.

883
01:44:11,794 --> 01:44:14,854
Can you get us in?
Past security?

884
01:44:14,898 --> 01:44:16,991
I think so, yeah. When?

885
01:44:21,872 --> 01:44:22,997
Now?

886
01:44:26,810 --> 01:44:29,905
<i>The future,
always so clear to me...</i>

887
01:44:29,946 --> 01:44:32,972
<i>had become like
a black highway at night.</i>

888
01:44:33,016 --> 01:44:35,781
<i>We were in
uncharted territory now...</i>

889
01:44:35,820 --> 01:44:38,789
<i>making up history
as we went along.</i>

890
01:45:17,060 --> 01:45:19,029
Carl, right?

891
01:45:20,331 --> 01:45:23,790
Friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd...

892
01:45:23,835 --> 01:45:25,894
take 'em upstairs
and show 'em around.

893
01:45:25,937 --> 01:45:29,270
Mr. Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

894
01:45:29,307 --> 01:45:31,468
I need written authorization-

895
01:45:32,510 --> 01:45:34,569
I insist.

896
01:45:34,612 --> 01:45:36,410
Don't even think about it.

897
01:45:47,325 --> 01:45:48,792
It's okay.

898
01:45:50,194 --> 01:45:53,358
It takes two keys, turned
simultaneously, to open the vault.

899
01:45:53,398 --> 01:45:56,367
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

900
01:45:57,669 --> 01:45:59,136
Gibbons?

901
01:46:02,175 --> 01:46:04,040
Gibbons! Come on, man!

902
01:46:04,077 --> 01:46:07,204
You can't leave the desk
like that!

903
01:46:12,018 --> 01:46:13,507
Oh, shit.

904
01:46:31,072 --> 01:46:33,130
My card should access this.

905
01:46:37,744 --> 01:46:40,212
- What is it?
- Damn it.

906
01:46:40,246 --> 01:46:42,237
The silent alarm's been tripped.

907
01:46:48,388 --> 01:46:51,152
It's neutralized all the codes
in the entire building.

908
01:46:51,191 --> 01:46:53,158
Nothing will open anywhere now.

909
01:46:54,195 --> 01:46:56,095
We have to abort.

910
01:46:59,266 --> 01:47:02,702
We go all the way.
Okay?

911
01:47:04,805 --> 01:47:08,673
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

912
01:47:08,708 --> 01:47:11,176
- I think it's that guy from the mall.
- It is.

913
01:47:11,211 --> 01:47:13,178
It's him and the woman.

914
01:47:14,714 --> 01:47:17,947
Just send everything
you got in the area right now.

915
01:47:20,121 --> 01:47:23,578
I have a personal entry code
for the lab. It may still work.

916
01:47:28,062 --> 01:47:29,188
It's no good.

917
01:47:29,230 --> 01:47:30,753
Let me try mine.

918
01:47:35,736 --> 01:47:37,864
John, fire in the hole!

919
01:47:49,851 --> 01:47:54,720
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the Halon system.

920
01:48:01,831 --> 01:48:03,830
You have to wait
until the gas clears.

921
01:48:06,797 --> 01:48:08,094
Put this on.

922
01:48:22,045 --> 01:48:24,605
All right, let's get to work.

923
01:48:45,736 --> 01:48:49,069
<i>All units in the vicinity
and all units able to respond...</i>

924
01:48:49,106 --> 01:48:53,976
<i>a 211 in progress, 2144 Kramer Street,
the Cyberdyne building.</i>

925
01:48:54,012 --> 01:48:55,705
<i>Suspect one is white female...</i>

926
01:48:55,746 --> 01:48:59,238
<i>identified as last name Connor,
first name Sarah.</i>

927
01:48:59,282 --> 01:49:02,252
<i>Escaped last night
from Pescadero State Hospital.</i>

928
01:49:02,285 --> 01:49:04,254
<i>Suspect two: White male...</i>

929
01:49:07,892 --> 01:49:10,087
All the disks in my office...

930
01:49:10,127 --> 01:49:12,322
all the disks
in that office over there...

931
01:49:12,363 --> 01:49:14,388
everything behind my desk...

932
01:49:14,432 --> 01:49:16,730
and all the processors
on my left.

933
01:49:16,767 --> 01:49:19,362
We'll blow those with the CP4.

934
01:49:32,950 --> 01:49:34,441
Can I...

935
01:49:35,086 --> 01:49:36,884
Excuse me.

936
01:49:38,557 --> 01:49:41,185
Can I borrow that thing?

937
01:49:50,269 --> 01:49:52,635
I worked a lot of years on this thing.

938
01:49:56,642 --> 01:49:58,872
<i>One-Mary-23,
give me that location again.</i>

939
01:49:58,911 --> 01:50:00,708
<i>2111 Kramer.</i>

940
01:50:00,746 --> 01:50:03,739
<i>Suspects are armed and
considered extremely dangerous.</i>

941
01:50:56,097 --> 01:50:57,827
All right.

942
01:50:57,867 --> 01:50:59,664
7-2-5-6.

943
01:51:06,642 --> 01:51:08,007
Easy money.

944
01:51:12,748 --> 01:51:14,214
Uh-oh.

945
01:51:16,919 --> 01:51:19,387
Oh, shit. Not good.

946
01:51:24,427 --> 01:51:26,087
How we doing?

947
01:51:26,127 --> 01:51:27,857
Primer cord is set.

948
01:51:27,897 --> 01:51:30,366
One more barrel,
two more minutes.

949
01:51:34,236 --> 01:51:37,205
- How do we set them off?
- Remote control.

950
01:51:37,239 --> 01:51:39,673
Piece of cake.

951
01:51:39,709 --> 01:51:41,266
- We got company.
- Police?

952
01:51:41,310 --> 01:51:44,712
- How many?
- All of 'em, I think.

953
01:51:44,748 --> 01:51:46,147
Go. I'll finish here.

954
01:51:48,118 --> 01:51:49,586
Come on.

955
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:52,588
I'll take care of the police.

956
01:51:52,622 --> 01:51:53,954
Wait! You swore!

957
01:51:56,893 --> 01:51:58,360
Trust me.

958
01:52:11,608 --> 01:52:13,269
<i>You at the window!</i>

959
01:52:13,311 --> 01:52:16,803
<i>Drop your weapon and place
your hands on top of your head!</i>

960
01:52:18,115 --> 01:52:19,979
Holy shit!

961
01:52:20,017 --> 01:52:21,574
That's a mini-gun!

962
01:52:43,808 --> 01:52:46,174
- Come on!
- Oh, shit!

963
01:52:46,210 --> 01:52:47,803
Go! Go! Go!

964
01:53:35,361 --> 01:53:36,828
Fire!

965
01:53:54,147 --> 01:53:55,843
Same time, to the left.

966
01:53:55,883 --> 01:53:58,249
One, two, three, go.

967
01:54:10,364 --> 01:54:13,231
In order to get that out-

968
01:54:19,974 --> 01:54:22,773
We got Skynet by the balls now.

969
01:54:22,810 --> 01:54:24,453
Come on, let's book.

970
01:54:25,678 --> 01:54:27,235
Hold your fire!

971
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:54,697
- Ready to rock?
- Ready.

972
01:54:58,310 --> 01:54:59,642
Time to go.

973
01:54:59,679 --> 01:55:01,169
Now.

974
01:55:01,214 --> 01:55:04,206
- Take this. They'll use gas.
- Come on.

975
01:55:04,249 --> 01:55:07,379
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

976
01:55:31,613 --> 01:55:34,411
Mom! Mom!

977
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:19,887
Shit!

978
01:56:21,296 --> 01:56:24,266
She's in the clean room.
There's no way outta there.

979
01:56:33,777 --> 01:56:34,799
Get down!

980
01:56:42,218 --> 01:56:43,685
Here.

981
01:57:09,179 --> 01:57:12,637
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

982
01:57:16,787 --> 01:57:18,312
Fall back!

983
01:57:18,355 --> 01:57:19,982
Everybody out!

984
01:57:20,024 --> 01:57:21,958
Fall back now!
Go! Go! Go!

985
01:57:57,361 --> 01:57:59,329
<i>We got a war zone here!</i>

986
01:58:31,230 --> 01:58:32,959
Shut your eyes.

987
01:58:39,538 --> 01:58:42,735
Stay here. I'll be back.

988
01:58:50,515 --> 01:58:52,881
Get down on the floor!
Face down!

989
01:58:55,587 --> 01:58:57,145
On the floor now!

990
01:58:59,491 --> 01:59:01,015
Okay, drop him!

991
02:00:20,874 --> 02:00:22,342
Here, hold this.

992
02:00:39,094 --> 02:00:40,721
Holy shit!

993
02:00:55,778 --> 02:00:56,801
Go!

994
02:01:35,651 --> 02:01:36,676
Shit!

995
02:01:50,167 --> 02:01:51,861
Get out.

996
02:02:10,887 --> 02:02:12,252
Listen.

997
02:02:12,289 --> 02:02:15,020
No matter what happens,
stay under these vests.

998
02:02:15,059 --> 02:02:16,388
- You got it?
- Yeah.

999
02:02:16,425 --> 02:02:17,893
All right.

1000
02:02:32,410 --> 02:02:33,706
Chopper's coming in!

1001
02:02:33,743 --> 02:02:34,870
It's him.

1002
02:03:32,639 --> 02:03:34,038
Shit!

1003
02:03:36,876 --> 02:03:38,707
Stay down!

1004
02:04:52,954 --> 02:04:54,750
Goddamn!

1005
02:04:54,789 --> 02:04:55,813
You okay-

1006
02:05:02,897 --> 02:05:05,364
Come on, Mom,
we gotta get out.

1007
02:05:07,235 --> 02:05:08,896
Take the shotgun.

1008
02:05:12,675 --> 02:05:13,697
Are you hurt?

1009
02:05:26,889 --> 02:05:27,913
Holy shit.

1010
02:05:27,957 --> 02:05:29,856
Come on, Mom. Come on!

1011
02:05:29,891 --> 02:05:31,050
We need your truck.

1012
02:05:31,092 --> 02:05:32,615
Hurry!

1013
02:05:37,599 --> 02:05:40,159
- Come on. Hurry.
- Get in.

1014
02:05:43,104 --> 02:05:44,367
Go!

1015
02:05:50,346 --> 02:05:52,371
What the hell-

1016
02:05:58,219 --> 02:06:01,018
- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

1017
02:06:02,658 --> 02:06:04,318
Here. This'll work.

1018
02:06:09,898 --> 02:06:11,594
He's gaining.

1019
02:06:14,135 --> 02:06:15,865
Step on it!

1020
02:06:15,904 --> 02:06:18,739
- This is the vehicle's top speed.
- I can run faster than this!

1021
02:06:29,552 --> 02:06:31,020
Coming up, to the right.

1022
02:06:33,056 --> 02:06:35,024
Watch it! Watch it!

1023
02:06:57,582 --> 02:06:59,709
- Drive.
- Where are you going?

1024
02:07:07,158 --> 02:07:09,125
Take the off-ramp.

1025
02:07:18,770 --> 02:07:19,963
Shit!

1026
02:07:23,106 --> 02:07:24,164
Hold on!

1027
02:08:10,023 --> 02:08:11,683
Don't stop!

1028
02:08:19,498 --> 02:08:20,897
Go straight!

1029
02:08:23,536 --> 02:08:24,559
Look out!

1030
02:08:24,604 --> 02:08:25,628
Duck!

1031
02:08:39,954 --> 02:08:41,921
Get the hell outta here!

1032
02:08:47,427 --> 02:08:50,521
Get outta here!
Let's go! Come on!

1033
02:10:07,475 --> 02:10:09,967
<i>Hasta la vista, baby.</i>

1034
02:10:59,462 --> 02:11:00,929
We don't have much time.

1035
02:11:23,553 --> 02:11:24,850
Let's go.

1036
02:11:25,889 --> 02:11:27,653
We gotta get outta here.

1037
02:11:27,691 --> 02:11:29,817
Come on! Get up!

1038
02:11:43,373 --> 02:11:45,136
Hand me the shotgun.

1039
02:11:49,912 --> 02:11:52,212
Put your weight on me, Mom.

1040
02:11:53,017 --> 02:11:54,951
Hurry!

1041
02:11:58,489 --> 02:12:00,150
Come on, Mom.

1042
02:12:06,631 --> 02:12:07,963
Get up!

1043
02:12:39,427 --> 02:12:41,395
This way. Come on.

1044
02:13:10,252 --> 02:13:12,949
Wait! No. No. It's too hot.

1045
02:13:12,988 --> 02:13:14,285
Go back.

1046
02:13:22,463 --> 02:13:24,762
- Go. Run.
- No! We gotta stick together.

1047
02:13:24,801 --> 02:13:26,826
John, you've got to go now.

1048
02:13:26,870 --> 02:13:29,065
- John!
- Go! Now!

1049
02:14:43,347 --> 02:14:45,315
Get up the steps.

1050
02:14:47,251 --> 02:14:48,718
Go.

1051
02:14:52,691 --> 02:14:54,158
Get up.

1052
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:57,086
Come on, Mom.
I got you.

1053
02:15:31,531 --> 02:15:33,897
Grab the chain. Grab it.

1054
02:15:35,268 --> 02:15:37,964
Grab it. Go. Go!

1055
02:15:48,314 --> 02:15:51,615
Mom, come on! Mom!

1056
02:16:40,768 --> 02:16:42,599
Call to John.

1057
02:16:45,372 --> 02:16:47,237
I know this hurts.

1058
02:16:49,044 --> 02:16:50,705
Call John.

1059
02:17:07,095 --> 02:17:09,756
Call to John now.

1060
02:17:11,832 --> 02:17:13,698
Fuck you.

1061
02:20:31,238 --> 02:20:32,704
Help!

1062
02:20:53,223 --> 02:20:54,315
Mom.

1063
02:20:56,525 --> 02:20:58,493
Help me.

1064
02:21:01,097 --> 02:21:02,394
Get out of the way, John.

1065
02:21:05,735 --> 02:21:06,258
Shoot!

1066
02:22:01,522 --> 02:22:03,989
Get down!

1067
02:23:37,253 --> 02:23:39,448
Get up. Come on.

1068
02:23:41,691 --> 02:23:43,522
Holy shit.

1069
02:23:43,560 --> 02:23:46,027
I need a vacation.

1070
02:23:59,242 --> 02:24:02,076
Is it dead?

1071
02:24:02,112 --> 02:24:03,579
Terminated.

1072
02:24:06,950 --> 02:24:08,713
Will this melt in there?

1073
02:24:11,655 --> 02:24:13,555
Yes. Throw it in.

1074
02:24:18,228 --> 02:24:19,253
Adios.

1075
02:24:20,630 --> 02:24:22,597
And the chip.

1076
02:24:37,748 --> 02:24:39,375
It's over.

1077
02:24:46,191 --> 02:24:47,885
There's one more chip.

1078
02:24:52,530 --> 02:24:54,829
And it must be destroyed also.

1079
02:25:00,238 --> 02:25:01,866
Here.

1080
02:25:01,908 --> 02:25:05,344
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

1081
02:25:18,456 --> 02:25:20,948
I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.

1082
02:25:20,992 --> 02:25:23,325
No, it'll be okay.
Stay with us.

1083
02:25:23,361 --> 02:25:25,421
- It'll be okay.
- I have to go away.

1084
02:25:25,464 --> 02:25:28,092
No, don't do it.
Please, don't go.

1085
02:25:28,133 --> 02:25:31,227
I must go away, John.

1086
02:25:31,270 --> 02:25:32,794
No, wait.

1087
02:25:32,840 --> 02:25:34,363
You don't have to do this.

1088
02:25:34,408 --> 02:25:35,772
I'm sorry.

1089
02:25:36,677 --> 02:25:38,974
No, don't do it! Don't go!

1090
02:25:39,011 --> 02:25:40,979
It has to end here.

1091
02:25:42,182 --> 02:25:47,523
I order you not to go!

1092
02:25:53,426 --> 02:25:55,484
I know now why you cry.

1093
02:25:57,865 --> 02:26:00,356
But it's something
I can never do.

1094
02:26:34,636 --> 02:26:36,865
Goodbye.

1095
