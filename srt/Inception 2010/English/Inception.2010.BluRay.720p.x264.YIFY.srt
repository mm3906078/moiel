21
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,447
Yes. In the dream state,
your conscious defenses are lowered...

22
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,033
...and that makes your thoughts
vulnerable to theft.

your subconscious to defend itself...

I know how to search your mind

And I can teach them to you,
so that even when you're asleep...

30

00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,469

- You're the architect.

I didn't know
he was gonna rub his cheek on it!

That's enough.

155
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,642
You. What the hell was all that?

156
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,021
- I have it under control.
- I'd hate to see you out of control.

157
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,983

Look, I'm, uh, sorry about your leg.
Won't happen again.

- Inception.

- Is it possible?
- Of course not.

209
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,460
If you can steal an idea
from someone's mind...

210
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,504
...why can't you plant one there instead?

211
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,756
Okay, here's me planting
an idea in your head.

212
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:39,260
I say, "Don't think about elephants."
What are you thinking about?

213
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,428
Elephants.

214
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,764
Right. But it's not your idea,
because you know I gave it to you.

215
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,934
The subject's mind can always trace
the genesis of the idea.

216
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:50,313
- True inspiration's impossible to fake.
- That's not true.

217
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,943
- Can you do it?
- Are you offering me a choice?

218
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,779
Because I can find my own way
to square things with Cobol.

219
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,990
Then you do have a choice.

220
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,950
Then I choose to leave, sir.

221
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,540
Tell the crew where you want to go.

Hey, Mr. Cobb.

How would you like to go home?

224
00:20:21,928 --> 00:20:25,222
To America. To your children.

225
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,976
You can't fix that. No one can.

226
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,396
- Just like inception.
- Cobb, come on.

227
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:39,028
- How complex is the idea?
- Simple enough.

228
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,740
No idea is simple when you need
to plant it in somebody else's mind.

229

My main competitor is
an old man in poor health.

230
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:50,581
His son will soon inherit control
of the corporation.

231
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,044
I need him to decide to break up
his father's empire.

232
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,422
- Cobb, we should walk away from this.
- Hold on.

233
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,761
If I were to do this,
if I even could do it...

234
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,846
...l'd need a guarantee.

235
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:09,266
- How do I know you can deliver?
- You don't.

236
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,352
But I can.

237
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:16,524
So do you want to take a leap of faith...

238
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,778
...or become an old man,
filled with regret...

239
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,531
...waiting to die alone?

240
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,913
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.
And choose your people more wisely.

241
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,881
Look, I know how much
you wanna go home.

242
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,386
This can't be done.

243
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,848
Yes, it can.
Just have to go deep enough.

244
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,558
You don't know that.

245
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,728
I've done it before.

246
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,105
Who'd you do it to?

247
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,362
Why are we going to Paris?

248
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,657
We're gonna need a new architect.

No space to think

252

Is it safe for you to be here?

253
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:38,230
Extradition between France
and the United States...

254
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,608
...is a bureaucratic nightmare,
you know that.

I think they might find a way
to make it work in your case.

256
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:48,199
Look, I, uh, brought these for you to give
to the kids when you have a chance.

257
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,951
It'll take more than
the occasional stuffed animal...

258
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,121
...to convince those children
they still have a father.

259
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,124
I'm just doing what I know.
I'm doing what you taught me.

260
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,793
I never taught you to be a thief.

261
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,170
No, you taught me to navigate
people's minds.

262
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,630
But after what happened...

263
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,383
...there weren't a whole lot of legitimate
ways for me to use that skill.

What are you doing here, Dom?

265
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,520
I think I found a way home.

But I need your help.

00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,992
You're here to corrupt
one of my brightest and best.

00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,037
You know what I'm offering.
Let them decide for themselves.

You remember.

273

It's the chance to build cathedrals,

...things that never existed...

in the real world.

follow you into your fantasy?

00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,348
They don't actually come into the dream.

278
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,810
They just design the levels
and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.

279
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,186
Design it yourself.

280
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,357

281
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,699
Come back to reality, Dom.

- Reality.

...they're waiting for their father to come
back home. That's their reality.

And this job, this last job,
that's how I get there.

286
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,217

Pleased to meet you.

a job offer he'd like to discuss with you.

293
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,410
A work placement?

294
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,078
Not exactly.

295
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,580
I have a test for you.

296
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,416
You're not gonna tell me anything first?

297

Before I describe the job,
I have to know you can do it.

298
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:08,589
- Why?
- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.

299
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:16,347
You have two minutes to design a maze

307

When we're asleep,
our mind can do almost anything.

Such as?

309
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,493
Imagine you're designing a building.
You consciously create each aspect.

310
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,497
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost
creating itself, if you know what I mean.

Yeah, like I'm discovering it.

Genuine inspiration, right?

313
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,588
Now, in a dream,
our mind continuously does this.

314
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:36,385
We create and perceive
our world simultaneously.

315
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,972
And our mind does this so well
that we don't even know it's happening.

That allows us to get right
in the middle of that process.

We bring the subject into that dream,
and they fill it with their subconscious.

How could I ever acquire enough detail
to make them think that it's reality?

while we're in them, right?

something was actually strange.

Let me ask you a question.

You never really remember
the beginning of a dream, do you?

You always wind up
right in the middle of what's going on.

Not like you.

447
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,740
Listen, if you're gonna perform inception,
you need imagination.

448
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:04,452
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it before?

449
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:08,248
We tried it. Uh, we got the idea in place,
but it didn't take.

450
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,751
- You didn't plant it deep enough?
- No, it's not just about depth.

451
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,920
You need the simplest version
of the idea...

452
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:17,757
...in order for it to grow naturally
in your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.

453
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,468
So, what is this idea
that you need to plant?

454
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:24,848
We need the heir of a major corporation
to dissolve his father's empire.

455
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,434
Right there you have
various political motivations...

456
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,603
...and anti-monopolistic sentiments
and so forth.

457
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,605
But all of that stuff, it's, um...

458
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:34,649
It's really at the mercy of your
subject's prejudice, you see?

459
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,319
What you have to do is
start at the absolute basic.

460
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,070
Which is what?

461
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,448
The relationship with the father.

462
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,327
- Do you have a chemist?
- No, not yet.

463
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:48,580
Right. Okay, well,
there's a man here, Yusuf.

<font color="#808080">ARIADNE :</font>
What kind of tricks?

506
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:04,234
In a dream, you can cheat architecture
into impossible shapes.

507
00:40:04,401 --> 00:40:08,321
That lets you create closed loops,
like the Penrose Steps.

508
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,656
The infinite staircase.

00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,542
Paradox.

511
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,126
So a closed loop like that...

512
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:25,380
...will help you disguise the boundaries
of the dream you create.

513
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,507
But how big do these levels have to be?

514
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,843
It could be anything from
the floor of a building to an entire city.

515
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:34,430
They have to be complicated enough
that we can hide from the projections.

516
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,015
- A maze?
- Right, a maze.

517
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,517
And the better the maze...

518
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,353
Then the longer we have
before the projections catch us?

519
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,813
Exactly.

520

00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,704
He thinks it's safer
if he doesn't know the layouts.

525
00:40:57,871 --> 00:40:58,955
Why?

526

He won't tell me. But I think it's Mal.

00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:40,486
It should be possible,
if you can get the right references.

596
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:45,157
References are something
of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

Mr. Browning...

599
00:45:50,163 --> 00:45:54,000
...Maurice Fischer's policy
is always one of avoiding litigation.

600
00:45:56,545 --> 00:46:01,007
Well, shall we voice your concerns
with Maurice directly?

601
00:46:01,174 --> 00:46:02,592
Not sure that's necessary.

602
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:05,428
No, no, no. I think we should.

608
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,845
Leave that.

609
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:52,892
Here.

610
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,563

Must be a cherished memory of his.

611
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:03,235
I put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.

612
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,071
Robert...

613
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:09,825
...we need to talk about
a power of attorney.

614
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:13,287
- I know this is hard, but it's imperative...
- Not now, Uncle Peter.

615
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,085
<font color="#808080">EAMES :</font>
The vultures are circling.

616
00:47:19,252 --> 00:47:23,673
And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,
the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.

617
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,258
I've had ample opportunity
to observe Browning...

618
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:31,263
...and adopt his physical presence, study
his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.

619
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:35,267
So now in the first layer of the dream,
I can impersonate Browning.

620
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:38,688
And suggest concepts
to Fischer's conscious mind.

621
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,690
Then, when we take him
a level deeper...

622
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:44,360
...his own projection of Browning
should feed that right back to him.

623
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,445
So he gives himself the idea.

624
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:50,866
Precisely. That's the only way it will stick.
It has to seem self-generated.

625
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:54,453
Eames, I am impressed.

626
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:58,165
Your condescension, as always,
is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.

00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,522
Were you going under on your own?

629
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,192
No, no, I was just, uh, running
some experiments.

630
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,319
I didn't realize anyone was here, so...

631
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,156
Yeah, I was just...
I was working on my totem, actually.

632
00:48:30,323 --> 00:48:31,490
Here, let me take a look.

633
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,994
So you're learning, huh?

634
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:38,664
An elegant solution
for keeping track of reality.

635
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,667
- Was it your idea?
- No, it was, uh...

636
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,003
It was Mal's, actually. This...

637
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:48,466
This one was hers. She would spin it
in the dream and it would never topple.

638
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:51,552
Just spin and spin.

639
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,014
Arthur told me she passed away.

640
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:59,018
How are the mazes coming along?

641
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,063
Each level relates to the part
of the subject's subconscious...

642
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,689
...that we are trying to access.

643
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:09,320
So I'm making the bottom level a hospital,
so Fischer will bring his father.

644
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:12,448
You know, l... Actually, I have a question
about this layout.

645
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:17,369
No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
Only the dreamer should know the layout.

646
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:18,704
Why is that so important?

647
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,873
In case one of us brings in
our projections.

648
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,375
We don't want them knowing
the details of the maze.

649
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,213
You mean in case you bring Mal in.

650
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,799
You can't keep her out, can you?

651
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,218
- Right.
- You can't build...

652
00:49:32,385 --> 00:49:35,721
...because if you know the maze,
then she knows it.

653
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,057
Well, she'd sabotage
the whole operation.

654
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:41,060
- Cobb, do the others know?
- No. No, they don't.

655
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,437
You've gotta warn them
if this is getting worse.

656
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,564
No one said it's getting worse.

657
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:50,069
I need to get home.
That's all I care about right now.

658
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,988
Why can't you go home?

659
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,119
Because they think I killed her.

660
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,624
- Thank you.
- For what?

661
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,085
For not asking whether I did.

662
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,420
"I will split up my father's empire."

663
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:12,800
Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject...

664
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,761
...which is why we need to plant it deep
in his subconscious.

665
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:19,473
The subconscious is motivated
by emotion, right? Not reason.

666
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:23,435
We need to find a way to translate this
into an emotional concept.

667
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:26,021
How do you translate business strategy
into emotion?

668
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:29,775
That's what we're here to figure out.
Robert's relationship with his father...

669
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:32,695
...is stressed, to say the least.
- Can we run with that?

670
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:36,448
We suggest breaking up his father's
company as a "screw you" to the old man.

671
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:40,119
No, because I think positive emotion
trumps negative emotion every time.

672
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:44,206
We all yearn for reconciliation,
for catharsis.

673
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:48,127
We need Robert Fischer to have
a positive emotional reaction to all this.

674
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,129
All right, well, try this. Um...

675
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:55,050
"My father accepts that I want to create
for myself, not follow in his footsteps."

676
00:50:55,468 --> 00:50:56,510
That might work.

677
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:59,847
Might? We're gonna need to do
a little better than "might."

678
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,974
Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.

679
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:05,102
Forgive me for wanting
a little specificity, Eames.

680
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,395
Specificity?

681
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,397
Inception's not about being specific.

682
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:12,526
When we get inside his mind, we're
gonna have to work with what we find.

683
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,822
<font color="#808080">EAMES :</font> On the top level, we open up
his relationship with his father...

684

in my father's footsteps."

685
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:24,914
Then the next level down, we feed him,
"I will create something for myself."

686
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:28,417
Then, by the time we hit the bottom level,
we bring out the big guns.

687
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,003
- "My father doesn't want me to be him."

three layers of dreaming...

692

697
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:06,580
...whilst accelerating brain function.
- In other words, more time on each level.

698
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:09,875
Brain function in the dream will be
about 20 times normal.

699
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:13,587
And when you enter a dream within
that dream, the effect is compounded.

It's three dreams,
that's 10 hours times 20...

How much time is that?

It's a week, the first level down.

Six months the second level down,
and the third level...

Depends on the dream.

So once we've made the plant,
how do we get out?

elegant than shooting me in the head.

That's the clever part.

I customized the sedative to leave
inner-ear function unimpaired.

715
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:03,095
That way, however deep the sleep,
the sleeper still feels falling.

716
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,597
Or tipping.

717
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:10,436
The trick is to synchronize a kick
that can penetrate all three levels.

718
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:14,481
We could use a musical countdown
to synchronize the different kicks.

<font color="#808080">COBB :</font> Why the hell didn't it?
- Calm down.

889
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,580
<font color="#808080">COBB :</font>
Don't tell me to calm down!

890
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,666
This was your job, goddamn it!
This was your responsibility!

891
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:10,919
You were meant to check
Fischer's background!

892
01:08:11,086 --> 01:08:14,422
- We are not prepared for this!
- We have dealt with sub-security before!

893
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,674
We'll be more careful
and we're gonna be fine!

894
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:18,676
This was not a part of the plan!
He's dying.

895
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:19,886
Put him out his misery.

896
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:22,889
- No, don't do that! Don't do that.
- Cobb, hey, hey.

897
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:25,183
He's in agony. I'm waking him up.

898
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:27,226
No. It won't wake him up.

899
01:08:27,394 --> 01:08:31,022
What do you mean, it won't wake him up?
When we die in a dream, we wake up.

900
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:32,440
Not from this.

901
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:35,151
We're too heavily sedated
to wake up that way.

902
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:37,445
Right. So, what happens when we die?

903
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,447
- We drop into limbo.
- Are you serious?

904
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:42,158
- Limbo?

- Just raw, infinite subconscious.

906

what might have been left behind...

907
01:08:49,124 --> 01:08:52,043
...by anyone sharing the dream
who's been trapped there before.

908
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,087
Which, in our case, is just you.

909
01:08:54,254 --> 01:08:56,965
- How long could we be stuck?
<font color="#808080">YUSUF :</font> Can't even think about...

911
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:02,929
Decades. It could be infinite.
Ask him, he's the one who's been there.

912
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:04,305

914
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:07,392
Great.

915
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:09,894
Thank you.

916
01:09:10,562 --> 01:09:13,815
So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind,
battling his own private army.

917
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,441
And if we get killed...

918
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:18,861
...we'll be lost in limbo till our brains
turn to scrambled egg, hmm?

919
01:09:25,744 --> 01:09:27,578
<font color="#808080">ARTHUR :</font>
Someone got first aid?

920
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:33,292
- You knew these risks and didn't tell us?
- There weren't meant to be risks.

921
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:36,421
- I didn't know we'd be dealing with gunfire.
- You had no right.

922
01:09:36,588 --> 01:09:38,923
This was the only way
to go three layers deep.

923
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:41,092
You knew about this
and went along with it?

924
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,301
I trusted him.

925
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:44,387
When? When he promised you
half his share?

926
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:47,807
No. His whole share.
Besides, he said he'd done it before.

927
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:50,059
What, with Mal?
Because that worked so good?

928
01:09:50,227 --> 01:09:53,646
That has nothing to do with it.
I did what I had to to get to my children.

929
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:55,732
You led us into a war zone
with no way out?

930
01:09:55,899 --> 01:09:59,944
There is a way out. We continue on with
the job, and we do it as fast as possible...

931
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:02,447
...and we get out using the kick,
just like before.

932
01:10:02,614 --> 01:10:05,074
Forget it. We go any deeper,
we just raise the stakes.

933
01:10:05,242 --> 01:10:07,118
I am sitting this one out on this level.

936

That means each and every one of us
will be killed. That I can guarantee you.

937
01:10:16,628 --> 01:10:20,423
We have no other choice but to continue on
and do it as fast as possible.

Downwards is the only way forwards.

you were the only one able to open it.

No, he never gave me any combination.

Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you
just didn't know it was a combination.

We didn't have very many, uh,
meaningful experiences together.

01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:56,162
Perhaps after your mother died.

985
01:12:58,832 --> 01:13:01,542
After my mother died,
you know what he told me?

986
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:08,174
"Robert,
there's really nothing to be said."

Oh, well, he was bad with emotion.

- How's he doing?
- He's in a lot of pain.

990
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:21,312
When we get down to the lower levels,
the pain will be less intense.

991
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,730
And if he dies?

992
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,358
Worst-case scenario?

993
01:13:25,525 --> 01:13:28,236
When he wakes up,
his mind is completely gone.

994
01:13:28,403 --> 01:13:32,490

remember that we had an arrangement.

997

Limbo is gonna become your reality.

Breathe.

1005
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:06,732
These people are gonna kill us

1006
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,818
- They just wanna ransom us.
- I heard them.

1007
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:12,863
They're gonna lock us in that van,
and then drive it into the river.

1008
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:14,532
All right. What is in the safe?

1009
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:16,784
Something for you.

1010
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:21,539
Maurice always said
it was his most precious gift to you.

1011
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:25,376
- A will.
- Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.

1012
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:26,752
That's an alternate.

1013
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,297
This would supersede the other
if you want it to.

1014
01:14:29,464 --> 01:14:32,091
It splits up the component businesses
of Fischer Morrow.

1015
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:35,970
It'd be the end of the entire empire
as we know it.

1016
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:38,597
Destroying my whole inheritance?

1017
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:43,436
- Why would he suggest such a thing?
- I just don't know.

1018
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:48,274
He loved you, Robert.

1019
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:50,484
In his own way.

1020

He could barely speak.

But he took the trouble
to tell me one last thing.

01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,546
He pulled me close.

1026
01:15:13,216 --> 01:15:15,301
And I could only make out...

1027
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,595
...one word.

1028

The truth that, at any minute, you might
bring a freight train through the wall.

1034

The truth that Mal is bursting
through your subconscious.

And the truth that,
as we go deeper into Fischer...

1036
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:50,836
...we're also going deeper into you.

1037
01:15:51,671 --> 01:15:54,965
And I'm not sure
we're gonna like what we find.

1038
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:00,429
We were working together.

1039
01:16:00,597 --> 01:16:04,266
We were exploring the concept
of a dream within a dream.

1040
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:05,726
I kept pushing things.

1041
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:09,563
I wanted to go deeper and deeper.
I wanted to go further.

1042
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:14,944
I just didn't understand the concept that
hours could turn into years down there...

1043
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,822
...that we could get trapped so deep...

1044
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:21,992
...that when we wound up on the shore
of our own subconscious...

1045
01:16:22,577 --> 01:16:25,121
...we lost sight of what was real.

1046
01:16:31,169 --> 01:16:33,754
We created.
We built the world for ourselves.

1047
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:37,383
We did that for years.

1048
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:40,511
We built our own world.

1049
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:43,556
How long were you stuck there?

1050
01:16:44,724 --> 01:16:46,851
Something like 50 years.

1051
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:51,397
Jesus.

1052
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:55,025
How could you stand it?

1053
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:57,945
It wasn't so bad at first,
feeling like gods.

1054
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:01,157
The problem was knowing
that none of it was real.

1055
01:17:01,324 --> 01:17:05,703
Eventually, it just became impossible
for me to live like that.

1056
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:07,288
And what about for her?

1057
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:14,670
She had locked something away,
something deep inside her.

1058
01:17:16,047 --> 01:17:21,302
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

1059
01:17:24,222 --> 01:17:26,724
Limbo became her reality.

1060
01:17:28,059 --> 01:17:29,894
What happened when you woke up?

1061
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:34,064
Well, to wake up from that
after years, after decades...

1062
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:39,653
...to become old souls thrown back
into youth like that?

1063
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:44,325
I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.

1064
01:17:45,702 --> 01:17:47,953
Eventually, she told me the truth.

1065
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:51,749
She was possessed by an idea.

1066
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:57,630
This one very simple idea
that changed everything.

1067
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:01,258
That our world wasn't real.

1068
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:06,430
That she needed to wake up
to come back to reality...

1069
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:09,350
...that in order to get back home...

1070
01:18:10,602 --> 01:18:12,394
...we had to kill ourselves.

1071
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:22,488
- What about your children?
- She thought they were projections...

1072
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:25,658
...that our real children were waiting
for us up there somewhere.

1073
01:18:25,825 --> 01:18:27,535
<font color="#808080">MAL :</font> I'm their mother!
<font color="#808080">COBB :</font> Calm down.

1074
01:18:27,702 --> 01:18:28,953
I can tell the difference.

1075
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,455
If this is my dream,
why can't I control this?

1076
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:33,332
You don't know you're dreaming!

1077
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,709
<font color="#808080">COBB :</font> She was certain
there was nothing I could do...

1078
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:39,713
...no matter how much I begged,
no matter how much I pleaded.

1079
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:45,719
She wanted to do it,
but she could not do it alone.

1080
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:52,393
She loved me too much, so she came up
with a plan on our anniversary.

1081
01:19:18,461 --> 01:19:21,255
- Sweetheart, what are you doing?
- Join me.

1082
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:25,676
Just... Just step back inside. All right?
Just step back inside now, come on.

1083
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:30,306
No. I'm going to jump,
and you're coming with me.

1084
01:19:30,473 --> 01:19:32,182
No, I'm not.

1085
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:34,435
Now, you listen to me.

1086
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:39,273
If you jump, you're not gonna wake up,
remember? You're gonna die.

1087
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:41,358
Now, just step back inside.

1088
01:19:41,526 --> 01:19:44,278
Come on. Step back inside
so we can talk about this.

1089
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:46,363
We've talked enough.

1090
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,117
- Mal.
- Come out onto the ledge...

1091
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:52,995
...or I'll jump right now.
- Okay.

1092
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:59,043
We're gonna talk about this.

1093
01:19:59,919 --> 01:20:01,086
All right?

1094
01:20:01,254 --> 01:20:06,342
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
- No, honey.

1095
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:10,304
No, I can't. You know I can't do that.

1096
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:13,223
Take a second, think about our children.

1097
01:20:13,391 --> 01:20:15,142
Think about James.

1098
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:17,519
Think about Phillipa, now.

1099
01:20:17,687 --> 01:20:20,606
If I go without you,
they'll take them away anyway.

1100
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:24,068
- What does that mean?
- I filed a letter with our attorney...

1101
01:20:24,527 --> 01:20:27,863
...explaining how I'm fearful
for my safety.

1102
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:32,242
How you've threatened to kill me.

1103
01:20:35,038 --> 01:20:37,665
- Why did you do this?
- I love you, Dom.

1104
01:20:37,832 --> 01:20:39,583
Why did...? Why would you do this to me?

1105
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:42,628
I've freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them.

1106
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:45,839
We're going home to our real children.

1107
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:49,635
Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me,
all right? Mal, look at me, please?

1108
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:51,095
You're waiting for a train.

1109
01:20:51,596 --> 01:20:55,182
- Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!
- A train that will take you far away.

1110
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,351
James and Phillipa are waiting for you!

1111
01:20:57,519 --> 01:21:01,355
You know where you hope this train
will take you, but you can't know for sure.

1112
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,732
- Mal, look at me!
- But it doesn't matter.

1113
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:07,111
- Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!
- Because you'll be together.

1114
01:21:07,278 --> 01:21:11,115
Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!

1115
01:21:11,282 --> 01:21:12,700
Jesus Christ!

1116
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:19,957
She had herself declared sane
by three different psychiatrists.

1117
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:24,294
It made it impossible for me to try
to explain the nature of her madness.

1118
01:21:24,462 --> 01:21:25,713
So I ran.

1123
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:46,483
I left my children behind and I've been
trying to buy my way back ever since.

1124
01:21:47,026 --> 01:21:50,904
Your guilt defines her.
It's what powers her.

1125
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:54,366
But you are not responsible
for the idea that destroyed her.

1126
01:21:55,618 --> 01:21:58,162
And if we are gonna succeed in this...

1127
01:21:58,329 --> 01:22:03,333
...you have to forgive yourself,
and you're gonna have to confront her.

1128
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:05,335
But you don't have to do that alone.

1129
01:22:05,503 --> 01:22:07,755
- No, you're not...
- I'm doing it for the others.

1130
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:13,510
Because they have no idea the risk
they've taken coming down here with you.

1131
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,100
We have to move.

1132
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:21,685
Time's up.

1133
01:22:21,853 --> 01:22:24,605
All right. I don't know any combination.

1134
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,858
- Not consciously, anyway.
<font color="#808080">COBB :</font> How about instinctively, huh?

1135
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:31,987
I got somebody in your father's office
right now ready to tap in the combination.

1136
01:22:32,155 --> 01:22:35,032
Give me the first six numbers
that come to your head right now.

1137
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,451
- I have no idea.
- Right now!

1138
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,870
I said, right now! Right now!

1139
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:43,916
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.

1140
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,797
You'll have to do better than that.

1141

01:23:08,983 --> 01:23:11,527
Relationship with his father
is worse than we imagined.

This helps us how?

The stronger the issues,
the more powerful the catharsis.

1147

- How are we gonna reconcile them?
- I'm working on that.

1148
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:23,997
Work faster.
The projections are closing in quick.

1149
01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:27,751
We gotta break out of here
before we're totally boxed in.

Damn it.

You mustn't be afraid to dream
a little bigger, darling.

1152
01:24:23,808 --> 01:24:26,810
We need to shift his animosity
from his father to his godfather.

1153
01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:30,981
- Destroy his one positive relationship?
- No, repair his relationship with his father...

1154
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:33,483
...whilst exposing his godfather's
true nature.

1155
01:24:33,651 --> 01:24:36,653
We should charge Fischer a lot more
than Saito for this job.

get worse as we go deeper.

his security's gonna be all over us.

We run with Mr. Charles
like on the Stein job.

Listen to me.
You drive carefully, all right?

1167
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:07,517
Everything down there is
gonna be unstable as hell.

1168

one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.

it's coming. The rest is on you.

They're trying to extract a number
from your subconscious.

01:33:08,999 --> 01:33:12,794
It can represent anything.
We're in a hotel right now.

01:33:16,882 --> 01:33:19,717
Try and remember for me.
This is very important.

1295

Five.

1296
01:33:22,179 --> 01:33:24,639
Five, two... It was something,
it was a long number.

1297
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:26,891
That's good. We can start there.
Fifth floor.

- No, I have to judge it for myself.

1300
01:33:32,523 --> 01:33:35,775
While you're all asleep in 528,
I wait for Yusuf's kick.

1301
01:33:35,943 --> 01:33:38,069
- Well, how will you know?
- His music warns me.

1302
01:33:38,237 --> 01:33:42,198
And then when the van hits the barrier
of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.

1303
01:33:42,366 --> 01:33:45,535
So we get a nice synchronized kick.

1304
01:33:45,703 --> 01:33:48,121
If it's too soon,
we won't get pulled out.

1305
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:51,541
But if it's too late,
I won't be able to drop us.

1306
01:33:51,709 --> 01:33:55,545
- Well, why not?
- Because the van will be in freefall.

1307
01:33:56,046 --> 01:33:58,882
- Can't drop you without gravity.
- Right.

1308
01:34:04,555 --> 01:34:06,764
They're with me. Go on.

- Yeah, I think so.

They were trying to put you under.

- I'm already under.
- Under again.

Hey. I see you've changed.

Hello.

1472
01:52:24,696 --> 01:52:27,906
<font color="#808080">ARIADNE :</font> Eames!
Eames, get to the antechamber now!

1473
01:53:11,826 --> 01:53:14,703
<font color="#808080">EAMES :</font> What happened?
- Mal killed Fischer.

1474
01:53:16,956 --> 01:53:18,999
I couldn't shoot her.

1475
01:53:19,667 --> 01:53:23,045
There's no use in reviving him.
His mind's already trapped down there.

1476
01:53:23,212 --> 01:53:24,254
It's all over.

1477
01:53:26,007 --> 01:53:27,632
So that's it, then? We failed?

1478
01:53:28,259 --> 01:53:30,427
We're done. I'm sorry.

1479
01:53:34,307 --> 01:53:36,933
It's not me that doesn't get back
to my family, is it?

1480
01:53:37,643 --> 01:53:41,563
Shame. I wanted to know what was
gonna happen in there. I swear we had this.

1481
01:53:41,731 --> 01:53:43,774
Let's set the charges.

1482
01:53:45,610 --> 01:53:47,110
No, there's still another way.

1483
01:53:48,404 --> 01:53:51,823
- We have to follow Fischer down there.
- Not enough time.

1484
01:53:51,991 --> 01:53:54,826
No, but there will be enough time
down there.

1485
01:53:55,953 --> 01:53:57,079
And we will find him.

1486
01:53:57,246 --> 01:54:01,166
Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in,
just use the defibrillator to revive him.

1487
01:54:01,334 --> 01:54:04,252
We can give him his own kick
down below.

1488
01:54:05,254 --> 01:54:06,963
Look, you get him in there.

1489
01:54:07,131 --> 01:54:10,008
As soon as the music ends,
you blow up the hospital...

1490
01:54:10,176 --> 01:54:12,969
...and we all ride the kick
back up the layers.

1491
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:18,934
It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold
the guards off while I set the charges.

1492
01:54:19,102 --> 01:54:21,228
Saito will never make it, will he?

1493
01:54:23,272 --> 01:54:25,732
- Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this.
- Go for it.

1494
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:28,819
If you are not back before the kick,
I am gone with or without you.

1495
01:54:28,986 --> 01:54:32,239
She's right. She's right.
Come on. Let's go.

1496
01:54:36,452 --> 01:54:38,662
Can I trust you to do
what needs to happen here?

1497
01:54:38,830 --> 01:54:40,038
Mal's gonna be down there.

1498
01:54:40,206 --> 01:54:42,624
I know where to find her.
She'll have Fischer.

1499
01:54:42,792 --> 01:54:46,711
- How do you know?
- Because she wants me to come after him.

1500
01:54:46,879 --> 01:54:49,047
She wants me back down there with her.

1501
01:55:15,825 --> 01:55:16,825
All right?

1502
01:55:24,083 --> 01:55:26,751
- This is your world?
- It was.

1503
01:55:27,545 --> 01:55:29,504
And this is where she'll be.

1504
01:55:30,214 --> 01:55:31,256
Come on.

1507
01:56:21,182 --> 01:56:25,143
I need you to take care of Fischer
while I go set some charges, okay?

1508
01:56:25,311 --> 01:56:28,730
No room for tourists on these jobs.

1509
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:32,567
Don't be silly.

You built all this? This is incredible.

1511
01:57:07,603 --> 01:57:09,604
We built for years.

1512
01:57:10,648 --> 01:57:12,649
Then we started in on the memories.

1513
01:57:19,699 --> 01:57:21,116
This way.

1514
01:58:02,783 --> 01:58:04,868

This was our neighborhood.

Places from our past.

1516
01:58:07,538 --> 01:58:09,330
That was our first apartment.

1517
01:58:09,498 --> 01:58:11,708
Then we moved to that building
right there.

1518
01:58:11,876 --> 01:58:14,419
After Mal became pregnant,
that became our home.

1519
01:58:14,587 --> 01:58:17,380
You reconstructed all of this
from memory?

1520
01:58:17,548 --> 01:58:19,841
Like I told you, we had lots of time.

That's the house Mal grew up in.

01:58:25,056 --> 01:58:27,515
- Well, will she be in there?
- No.

1524
01:58:27,850 --> 01:58:28,850
Come on.

1525
01:58:29,018 --> 01:58:32,353
We both wanted to live in a house,
but we loved this type of building.

1526
01:58:32,521 --> 01:58:35,482
In the real world,
we'd have to choose, but not here.

1534

We're gonna have to come up
with some kind of a kick.

What?

1536
01:59:23,489 --> 01:59:24,572
I'm gonna improvise.

1537
01:59:24,740 --> 01:59:29,410
Listen, there's something you should
know about me. About inception.

Highly contagious.

And the smallest seed
of an idea can grow.

1543
01:59:53,352 --> 01:59:55,311
It can grow to define...

"Your world is not real."

1547
02:00:07,074 --> 02:00:10,827

So certain of your world. Of what's real.

Do you think he is?

What truth?

your reality came from me.

You planted the idea in my mind?

What is she talking about?

1594
02:03:03,959 --> 02:03:09,213
The reason I knew inception was possible
was because I did it to her first.

1595
02:03:10,257 --> 02:03:13,217
- I did it to my own wife.
- Why?

I knew we needed to escape,
but she wouldn't accept it.

1598
02:03:24,229 --> 02:03:29,901
She had locked something away,
something deep inside.

1599
02:03:30,652 --> 02:03:34,822
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

And she couldn't break free.

So I decided to search for it.

1602
02:03:43,916 --> 02:03:48,795
I went deep into the recess of her mind
and found that secret place.

1603

And I broke in...

1604

...and I planted an idea.

A simple little idea
that would change everything.
