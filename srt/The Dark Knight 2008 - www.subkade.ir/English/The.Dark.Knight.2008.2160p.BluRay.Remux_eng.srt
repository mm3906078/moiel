1
00:01:45,107 --> 00:01:47,947
- Three of a kind, let's do this.
- That's it? Three guys?

2
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,446
Two guys on the roof. Every guy gets
a share. Five shares is plenty.

3
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:54,093
Six shares.
Don't forget the guy who planned the job.

4
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:56,561
He thinks he can sit it out
and still take a slice.

5
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:59,830
- I know why they call him the Joker.
- Why do they call him the Joker?

6
00:01:59,997 --> 00:02:01,832
- I heard he wears makeup.
- Makeup?

7
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:03,959
Yeah, to scare people.
You know, war paint.

8
00:02:16,513 --> 00:02:19,725
All right, everybody,
hands up, heads down!

9
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,894
I said, hands up, heads down!

10
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:26,023
Let's go, pal,
I'm making a withdrawal here.

11
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:27,733
- I said, hands up!
- No!

12
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:30,360
Here comes the silent alarm.

13
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:31,862
And there it goes.

14
00:02:32,029 --> 00:02:33,238
Heads down!

15
00:02:33,405 --> 00:02:35,741
All right, tootsie,
you're taking a dive with me.

16
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:38,577
- Down! I said, stay down there!
- Don't hurt me!

17
00:02:38,827 --> 00:02:41,830
Funny, it didn't dial 911.
It was trying to reach a private number.

18
00:02:41,997 --> 00:02:43,917
- Is it a problem?
- No, I'm done here.

19
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,677
Sit down! Down!

20
00:02:56,178 --> 00:02:58,347
Down! I said, stay down there!

21
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:05,437
Obviously we don't want you
doing anything with your hands...

22
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:08,523
...other than holding on for dear life.

23
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:18,283
On the ground! Stay on the ground!

24
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,120
Nobody make a move!
Nobody! Stay down!

25
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:39,596
Yeah!

26
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:44,518
You have any idea
who you're stealing from?

27
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:48,397
- You and your friends are dead.
- He's out, right?

28
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:52,734
What...?

29
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:02,327
Where did you learn to count?

30
00:04:05,122 --> 00:04:08,583
They wired this thing up with like
5000 volts. What kind of bank does that?

31
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,795
A Mob bank.
I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.

32
00:04:11,962 --> 00:04:13,004
Where's the alarm guy?

33
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:15,731
Boss told me when the guy
was done, I should take him out.

34
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:17,175
One less share, right?

35
00:04:18,093 --> 00:04:20,345
Funny, he told me something similar.

36
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:21,972
He what? No! No!

37
00:04:33,692 --> 00:04:35,068
That's a lot of money.

38
00:04:35,235 --> 00:04:38,947
If this Joker guy was so smart,
he'd have had us bring a bigger car.

39
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:44,286
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me
soon as we loaded the cash.

40
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:48,999
No, no, no, I kill the bus driver.

41
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:50,834
Bus driver?

42
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:54,546
What bus driver?

43
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:00,552
School's out. Time to go.

44
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:02,971
That guy's not getting up, is he?

45
00:05:03,722 --> 00:05:05,390
That's a lot of money.

46
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:11,229
What happened to the rest of the guys?

47
00:05:17,986 --> 00:05:20,363
You think you're smart, huh?

48
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:22,699
The guy that hired youse...

49
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:25,827
...he'll just do the same to you.

50
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:29,080
Oh, criminals in this town
used to believe in things.

51
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:30,540
Honor...

52
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:32,417
...respect.

53
00:05:32,584 --> 00:05:34,920
Look at you.
What do you believe in, huh?

54
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:36,379
What do you believe in?!

55
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:41,635
I believe whatever doesn't kill you
simply makes you...

56
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,763
...stranger.

57
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:29,641
Mr. Mayor, you were elected
in a campaign to clean up the city.

58
00:06:29,808 --> 00:06:31,977
- When are you gonna start?
- I already have.

59
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:35,981
Like this Batman. We're hearing he's
doing good, criminals are running scared.

60
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:39,860
- No, man. I don't like it tonight.
- What are you, superstitious?

61
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:43,113
You got more chance of winning
the Powerball than running into him.

62
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,658
That's not true. Our men in the
Major Crimes Unit are close to an arrest.

63
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:49,786
Hey, Wuertz, mayor says
you're closing in on the Batman.

64
00:06:49,953 --> 00:06:52,080
The investigation is ongoing.

65
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:54,687
The process of cleaning up
the streets is a long one.

66
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,835
I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have...

67
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:03,466
Ever intending to see your wife again,
lieutenant?

68
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:06,303
I thought you had to
go look after your mother, detective.

69
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:08,430
Checked her back into the hospital.

70
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:10,515
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:14,311
- So he hasn't shown up?
- He often doesn't.

72
00:07:14,686 --> 00:07:17,856
- I like reminding everybody he's out there.
- Why wouldn't he come?

73
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:20,025
Hopefully...

74
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:22,068
...because he's busy.

75
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:41,713
That's why we bring dogs.

76
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,215
- My little princes.
- Please.

77
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:47,969
Please, they're crawling in my mouth.
Please, I beg you, get them off.

78
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:50,889
Look what your drugs
do to my customers.

79
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:52,682
Buyer beware.

80
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:56,061
I told you my compound
would take you places.

81
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:58,980
I never said they'd be places
you wanted to go.

82
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:01,691
My business, repeat customers.

83
00:08:01,858 --> 00:08:05,487
You don't like what I have
to offer, you can buy from someone else.

84
00:08:05,654 --> 00:08:08,406
Assuming Batman left anyone
to buy from.

85
00:08:11,743 --> 00:08:15,747
My dogs are hungry.

86
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:21,753
Pity there's only one of you.

87
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:31,439
- What...?
- That's not him.

88
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:37,519
Loose the dogs!

89
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,783
That's more like it.

90
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:21,623
Don't let me find you out here again.

91
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,626
- We're trying to help you.
- I don't need help.

92
00:10:24,793 --> 00:10:26,127
Not my diagnosis.

93
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:29,881
What gives you the right?
What's the difference between you and me?

94
00:10:30,048 --> 00:10:32,926
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

95
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:38,389
Everybody back now!

96
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:43,728
He can't resist showing us his face.

97
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:50,151
What's he hiding under that makeup?

98
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:00,537
Uh, can we get a minute, people, please?

99
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:05,333
Him again. Who are the others?

100
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,085
Another bunch of smalltimers.

101
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:10,171
Some of the marked bills I gave you.

102
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:12,632
My detectives have been
making drug buys with them.

103
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,385
This bank was another drop for the Mob.
That makes five.

104
00:11:15,552 --> 00:11:18,138
- We found the bulk of their dirty cash.
- Time to move in.

105
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:22,100
We'd have to hit all banks simultaneously.
SWAT teams, backup.

106
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:24,102
What about this Joker guy?

107
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:27,230
One man or the entire Mob? He can wait.

108
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:29,732
When the new DA hears about this,
he'll want in.

109
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:32,443
- Do you trust him?
- Be hard to keep him out.

110
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,072
I hear he's as stubborn as you are.

111
00:12:19,616 --> 00:12:22,577
Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt.

112
00:12:22,744 --> 00:12:25,455
You can swap
not sleeping in a penthouse...

113
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:27,165
...for not sleeping in a mansion.

114
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:31,085
Whenever you stitch yourself up,
you do make a bloody mess.

115
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:34,255
Yeah. It makes me learn
from my mistakes.

116
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:37,842
You ought to be pretty knowledgeable
by now, then.

117
00:12:39,552 --> 00:12:40,595
My armor.

118
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:44,349
I'm carrying too much weight.
I need to be... I need to be faster.

119
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:47,185
I'm sure Mr. Fox can oblige.

120
00:12:47,352 --> 00:12:49,854
- Did you get mauled by a tiger?
- It was a dog.

121
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:52,565
It was a big dog.

122
00:12:52,732 --> 00:12:56,611
There were more copycats last night,
Alfred, with guns.

123
00:12:56,778 --> 00:12:58,696
Why not hire them,
take the weekend off?

124
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:01,699
That wasn't exactly
what I had in mind...

125
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:05,703
- ...when I said I wanted to inspire people.
- I know.

126
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,372
But things have improved.

127
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,041
Look at the new district attorney.

128
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,710
I am, closely.

129
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:14,796
Need to know if he can be trusted.

130
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:19,008
Are you interested in his character
or his social circle?

131
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:25,223
Who Rachel spends her time with
is her business.

132
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:29,269
I trust you don't have me followed
on my day off.

133
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:31,521
If you ever took one, I might.

134
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:35,233
Know your limits, Master Wayne.

135
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,528
Batman has no limits.

136
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:41,739
- Well, you do, sir.
- Well, can't afford to know them.

137
00:13:41,906 --> 00:13:44,409
And what's gonna happen
on the day that you find out?

138
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,287
We all know how much you like to say
"I told you so."

139
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:50,790
On that day, Master Wayne,
even I won't want to.

140
00:13:50,957 --> 00:13:52,417
Probably.

141
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:00,925
Sorry I'm late, folks.

142
00:14:04,846 --> 00:14:07,056
- Where were you?
- Worried you'd have to step up?

143
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:10,226
- Harvey, I know these briefs backwards.
- Well, then...

144
00:14:10,393 --> 00:14:12,395
...fair's fair.

145
00:14:12,562 --> 00:14:14,605
Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.

146
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:16,858
Yeah? You wanna
flip a coin to see who leads?

147
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:20,445
My father's lucky coin. As I recall,
it got me my first date with you.

148
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:23,781
I wouldn't leave something like that
up to chance.

149
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:27,201
I don't. I make my own luck.

150
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:32,749
All rise.
The Honorable Judge Freel presiding.

151
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:35,585
I thought the DA just
played golf with the mayor.

152
00:14:35,752 --> 00:14:39,464
Teeoff's 1:30. More than enough time
to put you away for life, Sally.

153
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,174
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham...

154
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:44,344
...someone must have stepped up
to run the so-called family.

155
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:47,472
Is that man in this courtroom today?

156
00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:52,643
- Could you identify him for us, please?
- You win, counselor.

157
00:14:54,979 --> 00:14:56,481
It was me.

158
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:01,986
I have a sworn statement from you
that this man...

159
00:15:02,153 --> 00:15:05,865
...Salvatore Maroni, is the new head
of the Falcone crime family.

160
00:15:06,032 --> 00:15:10,161
Maroni? He's a fall guy.
I'm the brains of the organization.

161
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:13,857
- Order.
- Permission to treat the witness as hostile?

162
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:15,718
- Granted.
- Hostile? I'll show you hostile!

163
00:15:21,923 --> 00:15:24,675
Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in China.

164
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:28,763
If you wanna kill a public servant,
Mr. Maroni, I recommend you buy American.

165
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,308
- Get him out of here.
- But, Your Honor, I'm not done.

166
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,315
We'll never be able to link the gun
to Maroni, so we can't charge him.

167
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:42,276
But they're trying to kill you,
means we're getting to them.

168
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:45,571
I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel.
I'm fine, by the way.

169
00:15:45,738 --> 00:15:47,448
Come on, Harvey. You're Gotham's DA.

170
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:50,451
You're not getting shot at,
you're not doing your job right.

171
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:51,828
But, you know...

172
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:55,331
...if you said you were rattled,
we could take the rest of the day off.

173
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:58,418
Can't. I dragged the head of
the Major Crimes Unit down here.

174
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:03,339
Oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually.
Try to be nice.

175
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:15,184
I hear you got a hell of a right cross.

176
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:20,606
It's a shame Sal's going to walk.

177
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:24,819
Yeah, well, good thing about the Mob
is they keep giving you second chances.

178
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:32,326
Lightly irradiated bills.

179
00:16:32,785 --> 00:16:35,079
Fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help?

180
00:16:35,538 --> 00:16:37,248
We liaise with various agencies...

181
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:39,167
Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him.

182
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,920
Official policy is to arrest the vigilante
known as Batman on sight.

183
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:45,256
What about that floodlight
on the top of MCU?

184
00:16:45,423 --> 00:16:47,842
If you got problems
with malfunctioning equipment...

185
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:51,220
...I suggest you take them up
with Maintenance, counselor.

186
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:54,056
I've put every money launderer
in Gotham behind bars...

187
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:56,601
...but the Mob
is still getting its money out.

188
00:16:56,767 --> 00:17:00,229
I think you and your friend
have found the last game in town.

189
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:03,107
You're trying to hit them
where it hurts, their wallets.

190
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:04,442
It's bold.

191
00:17:05,485 --> 00:17:06,527
You gonna count me in?

192
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:10,448
In this town, the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.

193
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:12,867
I don't like that you got
your own special unit...

194
00:17:13,034 --> 00:17:15,953
...and it's full of cops
I investigated at Internal Affairs.

195
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,956
If I didn't work with cops
you'd investigated while at IA...

196
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:20,374
...I'd be working alone.

197
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:25,630
I don't get political points for being an
idealist. I do the best I can with what I have.

198
00:17:29,217 --> 00:17:32,970
You want me to back warrants
for search and seizure on five banks...

199
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:34,972
...without telling me what we're after.

200
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:38,643
I can give you the names of the banks.

201
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:40,728
Well, that's a start.

202
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:43,439
I'll get you your warrants,
but I want your trust.

203
00:17:43,606 --> 00:17:47,443
Oh, you don't have to sell me, Dent.
We all know you're Gotham's white knight.

204
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:52,156
Yeah, well, I heard they have
a different name for me down at MCU.

205
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,075
I wouldn't know about that.

206
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:58,996
In China, Lau Security Investments
stands for dynamic new growth.

207
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:03,459
A joint Chinese venture with
Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.

208
00:18:03,626 --> 00:18:05,545
Well, Mr. Lau...

209
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,673
...I speak for the rest of the board...

210
00:18:09,257 --> 00:18:12,176
...and Mr. Wayne,
in expressing our own excitement.

211
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:20,685
Sir, I know Mr. Wayne is curious about
how his trust fund gets replenished...

212
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:23,354
...but, frankly, this is embarrassing.

213
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:26,107
You worry about the diligence,
Mr. Reese.

214
00:18:26,274 --> 00:18:28,568
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

215
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:30,278
It's done.

216
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,196
The numbers are solid.

217
00:18:32,363 --> 00:18:33,906
Do them again.

218
00:18:34,073 --> 00:18:37,159
Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out,
now, would we?

219
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,497
Another long night?

220
00:18:41,664 --> 00:18:44,625
This joint venture was your idea,
and the consultants love it.

221
00:18:45,293 --> 00:18:46,544
But I'm not convinced.

222
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:50,381
Lau's company has grown by
8 percent annually like clockwork.

223
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:52,967
His revenue stream
must be off the books...

224
00:18:53,134 --> 00:18:54,552
...maybe even illegal.

225
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:56,387
Okay. Cancel the deal.

226
00:18:57,722 --> 00:18:58,889
You already knew.

227
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:02,143
Just needed a closer look at their books.

228
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,353
Anything else you can trouble me for?

229
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:06,355
I need a new suit.

230
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:09,025
Yeah. Three buttons
is a little '90s, Mr. Wayne.

231
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:12,320
I'm not talking fashion, Mr. Fox,
so much as function.

232
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:15,072
You wanna be able to turn your head.

233
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:17,325
Sure make backing out
of the driveway easier.

234
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:19,327
I'll see what I can do.

235
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:26,042
Took three weeks
to get a reservation here.

236
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,336
I had to tell them
I work for the government.

237
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:31,172
- Really?
- Health inspector's not afraid to pull strings.

238
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:33,549
Rachel. Fancy that.

239
00:19:33,716 --> 00:19:36,218
Yeah, Bruce. Fancy that.

240
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:38,721
Rachel, Natascha. Natascha, Rachel.

241
00:19:38,888 --> 00:19:44,268
- Natascha. Are you the prima...?
- Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.

242
00:19:44,435 --> 00:19:47,772
- Wow. Harvey's taking me next week.
- Really? So you're into ballet?

243
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:50,274
Bruce. This is Harvey Dent.

244
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:54,362
The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel's told me everything about you.

245
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:55,738
I certainly hope not.

246
00:19:56,072 --> 00:19:59,408
- Let's put a couple tables together.
- I'm not sure that they'll let us.

247
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:02,620
Oh, they should. I own the place.

248
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:06,040
How could you want to raise children
in a city like this?

249
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:09,919
- Well, I was raised here. I turned out okay.
- Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?

250
00:20:10,086 --> 00:20:11,587
Is...?

251
00:20:11,754 --> 00:20:13,297
The Palisades? Sure.

252
00:20:13,464 --> 00:20:17,927
You know, as our new DA, you might wanna
figure out where your jurisdiction ends.

253
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:22,056
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante.

254
00:20:22,223 --> 00:20:25,601
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary citizen
standing up for what's right.

255
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:28,020
Gotham needs heroes like you,
elected officials...

256
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:31,482
- ...not a man who thinks he's above the law.
- Who appointed the Batman?

257
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:35,486
We did. All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city.

258
00:20:35,653 --> 00:20:37,405
But this is a democracy, Harvey.

259
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:39,331
When their enemies were at the gates...

260
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:43,202
...the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city.

261
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:45,955
It wasn't considered an honor,
it was a public service.

262
00:20:46,122 --> 00:20:50,251
Harvey, the last man that they appointed to
protect the republic was named Caesar...

263
00:20:50,418 --> 00:20:53,838
- ...and he never gave up his power.
- Okay, fine.

264
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:55,339
You either die a hero...

265
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:58,551
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

266
00:20:58,718 --> 00:21:02,221
Whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
wanna do this for the rest of his life.

267
00:21:02,388 --> 00:21:05,641
How could he? Batman is looking for
someone to take up his mantle.

268
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:08,102
Someone like you, Mr. Dent?

269
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:11,021
Maybe. If I'm up to it.

270
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:16,444
What if Harvey Dent
is the Caped Crusader?

271
00:21:18,696 --> 00:21:21,866
If I were sneaking out every night,
someone would've noticed by now.

272
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:28,372
Well, I'm sold, Dent,
and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.

273
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:31,375
That's nice, but I'm not
up for reelection for three years.

274
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:33,461
No, you don't understand.

275
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:36,422
One fundraiser with my pals...

276
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:39,216
...you'll never need another cent.

277
00:21:53,898 --> 00:21:56,025
What the hell is this?

278
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,488
As you're all aware,
one of our deposits was stolen.

279
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:04,033
A relatively small amount, 68 million.

280
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,744
Who's stupid enough to steal from us?

281
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:10,623
Two-bit wackjob,
wears a cheap purple suit and makeup.

282
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,750
He's not the problem. He's a nobody.

283
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:16,295
The problem is our money
being tracked by the cops.

284
00:22:16,462 --> 00:22:18,964
Thanks to Mr. Maroni's
well-placed sources...

285
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:22,927
...we know that police have indeed
identified our banks using marked bills...

286
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:25,596
...and are planning to
seize your funds today.

287
00:22:25,763 --> 00:22:29,767
And since the enthusiastic new DA has
put all my competitors out of business...

288
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:33,896
- ...I'm your only option.
- So, what are you proposing?

289
00:22:34,063 --> 00:22:37,733
Moving all deposits to
one secure location, not a bank.

290
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,860
- Where, then?
- No one can know but me.

291
00:22:40,611 --> 00:22:43,364
If the police were to gain leverage
over one of you...

292
00:22:43,531 --> 00:22:45,324
...everyone's money would be at stake.

293
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:47,618
What stop them getting to you?

294
00:22:47,785 --> 00:22:50,871
I go to Hong Kong,
far from Dent's jurisdiction...

295
00:22:51,247 --> 00:22:54,124
...and the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.

296
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,918
How soon can you move the money?

297
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,294
I already have.

298
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:02,299
For obvious reasons, I couldn't wait
for your permission.

299
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:06,595
Rest assured, your money is safe.

300
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:21,193
And I thought my jokes were bad.

301
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,446
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
have my boy pull your head off.

302
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:25,906
How about a magic trick?

303
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:31,579
I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.

304
00:23:33,873 --> 00:23:34,999
Ta-da!

305
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,667
It's...

306
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:39,128
It's gone.

307
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:41,839
Oh, and by the way,
the suit, it wasn't cheap.

308
00:23:42,006 --> 00:23:44,842
- You ought to know, you bought it.
- Sit.

309
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:48,971
I want to hear proposition.

310
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:54,184
Let's wind the clocks back a year.

311
00:23:54,518 --> 00:24:00,190
These cops and lawyers
wouldn't dare cross any of you.

312
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,485
I mean, what happened?

313
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:07,448
Did your balls drop off? Hm?

314
00:24:07,615 --> 00:24:09,658
You see, a guy like me...

315
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:12,870
- A freak.
- Damn right.

316
00:24:13,037 --> 00:24:16,165
A guy like me... Look, listen.

317
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:21,003
I know why you choose
to have your little, ahem...

318
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,881
...group-therapy sessions
in broad daylight.

319
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:27,176
I know why you're afraid
to go out at night.

320
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:31,055
The Batman.

321
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:36,477
See, Batman has shown Gotham
your true colors, unfortunately.

322
00:24:36,644 --> 00:24:40,147
Dent, he's just the beginning.

323
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:45,486
And as for the television's
so-called plan...

324
00:24:45,945 --> 00:24:47,821
...Batman has no jurisdiction.

325
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:50,574
He'll find him and make him squeal.

326
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:53,744
I know the squealers when I see them...

327
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:55,579
...and...

328
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,831
What do you propose?

329
00:24:57,998 --> 00:25:00,417
It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.

330
00:25:01,752 --> 00:25:04,713
If it's so simple, why haven't
you done it already?

331
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,591
If you're good at something,
never do it for free.

332
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:09,551
How much you want?

333
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,262
Uh, half.

334
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:17,226
- You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.

335
00:25:17,393 --> 00:25:19,520
No, I'm not.

336
00:25:21,105 --> 00:25:24,525
If we don't deal with this now...

337
00:25:24,692 --> 00:25:26,318
...soon...

338
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:31,448
...little Gambol here won't be able
to get a nickel for his grandma.

339
00:25:32,116 --> 00:25:33,575
Enough from the clown!

340
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:36,704
Ah, ta-ta-ta. Let's not blow...

341
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,415
- Shit!
- ...this out of proportion.

342
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:42,084
You think you can steal from us
and just walk away?

343
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:43,852
- Yeah.
- I'm putting the word out.

344
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:46,255
Five hundred grand for this clown dead.

345
00:25:46,422 --> 00:25:49,466
A million alive, so I can teach him
some manners first.

346
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:53,345
All right. So, listen,
why don't you give me a call...

347
00:25:53,512 --> 00:25:57,266
...when you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously?

348
00:25:57,433 --> 00:25:59,309
Here's my card.

349
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:21,790
You're a hard man to reach.

350
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:27,087
Lau's halfway to Hong Kong.

351
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,216
If you'd have asked,
I could have taken his passport.

352
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:34,053
All that was left in the vaults
were marked bills.

353
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:37,514
They knew we were coming.
As soon as your office got involved...

354
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:38,682
My office?

355
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:42,561
You're sitting down there with scum like
Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking...

356
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:45,856
Oh, yeah. I almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beat.

357
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:50,569
Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly
Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.

358
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:55,324
We need Lau back...

359
00:26:55,491 --> 00:26:59,453
...but the Chinese won't extradite
a national under any circumstances.

360
00:26:59,787 --> 00:27:02,498
If I get him to you,
can you get him to talk?

361
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:03,874
I'll get him to sing.

362
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:06,794
We're going after the Mob's life savings.

363
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,212
Things will get ugly.

364
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:10,672
I knew the risk when I took this job,
lieutenant.

365
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,382
How will you get him back, any...?

366
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:16,386
He does that.

367
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:20,057
Our Chinese friends left town
before I could tell them the deal was off.

368
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:23,727
Well, I'm sure that you've always wanted
to go to Hong Kong.

369
00:27:23,894 --> 00:27:26,063
What's wrong with a phone call?

370
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:29,858
I think Mr. Lau deserves
a more personal touch.

371
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:35,864
Now, for high-altitude jumps, you're
going to need oxygen and stabilizers.

372
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:39,660
Well, I must say,
compared to your usual requests...

373
00:27:39,827 --> 00:27:42,412
...jumping out of an airplane
is pretty straightforward.

374
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:45,165
What about getting back into the plane?

375
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:49,169
- I'd recommend a good travel agent.
- Without it landing.

376
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:53,090
Now, that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.

377
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:56,260
The CIA had a program back in the '60s...

378
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:59,763
...for getting their people out
of hot spots called Sky Hook.

379
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,599
- We could look into that.
- Yeah.

380
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:04,434
Okay. Now...

381
00:28:05,936 --> 00:28:10,941
Hardened Kevlar plates over titanium-dipped
tri-weave fibers for flexibility.

382
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:13,944
You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.

383
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:19,616
Perhaps you should
read the instructions first?

384
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:21,785
- Yeah.
- Now, there is a tradeoff.

385
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:25,455
Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

386
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:28,584
We wouldn't wanna make things
too easy, now, would we?

387
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,794
How will it hold up against dogs?

388
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:33,088
We talking rottweilers or Chihuahuas?

389
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:36,800
Should do fine against cats.

390
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:39,094
I found one in Arizona.

391
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:43,432
A very nice man said he could have it up
and running in a week, and he takes cash.

392
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:46,435
- What about the flight crew?
- South Korean smugglers.

393
00:28:46,602 --> 00:28:48,812
They run flights into Pyongyang,
below radar.

394
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:51,732
- Did you think of an alibi?
- Oh, yes.

395
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,128
I believe this is your plane, sir.

396
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:20,844
You look tired, Alfred.
You'll be all right without me?

397
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:26,016
If you can tell me the Russian for
"apply your own bloody suntan lotion."

398
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,989
Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.

399
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:42,991
They brought the body.

400
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:01,885
So, dead, that's 500.

401
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:05,639
How about alive?

402
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,020
You wanna know how I got these scars?

403
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:16,942
My father was...

404
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:18,568
...a drinker...

405
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:19,987
...and a fiend.

406
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:24,992
And one night,
he goes off crazier than usual.

407
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:28,203
Mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself.

408
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,913
He doesn't like that...

409
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,542
...not one bit.

410
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:36,253
So, me watching...

411
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:41,008
...he takes the knife to her,
laughing while he does it.

412
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:44,261
He turns to me and he says:

413
00:30:44,428 --> 00:30:48,098
"Why so serious?"

414
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:49,933
He comes at me with the knife.

415
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,519
"Why so serious?"

416
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:57,649
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

417
00:30:57,983 --> 00:31:01,903
"Let's put a smile on that face."

418
00:31:03,113 --> 00:31:05,324
And...

419
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:09,244
Why so serious?

420
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,792
Now...

421
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:18,211
...our operation is small...

422
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:21,298
...but there is a lot of potential...

423
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:24,009
...for aggressive expansion.

424
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:27,387
So which of you fine gentlemen
would like to join our team?

425
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:31,975
Oh. There's only one spot open right now,
so we're gonna have...

426
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:34,811
...tryouts.

427
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:41,401
Make it fast.

428
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:52,245
Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.

429
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:55,123
Mr. Lau regrets he is unable
to greet you in person today.

430
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,209
I understand.

431
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:10,597
For security purposes, I'm gonna have to
ask you to check in your mobile.

432
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:12,349
Of course.

433
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:18,814
I must apologize for leaving Gotham
in the middle of our negotiations.

434
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,526
This misunderstanding
with the Gotham police force...

435
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:25,237
- ...I couldn't let it threaten my company.
- Of course.

436
00:32:25,404 --> 00:32:28,573
A businessman of your stature
will understand and...

437
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,702
...with you here now, we can continue.

438
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:36,623
Well, I do appreciate you bringing me out
here in such style, Mr. Lau, but I re...

439
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:40,001
We do not allow cell phones in here.

440
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:42,879
I'm sorry. Forgot I had it.

441
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:47,676
No, I really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold.

442
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:51,304
You see, we can't afford
to be seen to do business with...

443
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:54,391
...whatever it is you're accused of being.

444
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:57,144
I'm sure a businessman of your stature
will understand.

445
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:01,231
I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone call
might have sufficed.

446
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:04,776
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think
he was deliberately wasting your time.

447
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:06,570
Just accidentally wasting it.

448
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:11,741
That's very good, Mr. Lau.
"Accidentally." Very good.

449
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:13,869
Hey, sir.

450
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:34,097
There's a better view from the peak tram.

451
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:36,099
How's the view from LSI Holdings?

452
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:37,934
Restricted.

453
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:40,103
Lau is holed up in there good and tight.

454
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:42,189
- What's this?
- I had R&D work it up.

455
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:44,024
Sends out a high-frequency pulse...

456
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:47,027
...records the response time
for mapping an environment.

457
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:50,113
Sonar. Just like a...

458
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,449
Submarine, Mr. Wayne. Like a submarine.

459
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:54,784
- And the other device?
- It's in place.

460
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:56,745
Mr. Wayne?

461
00:33:57,954 --> 00:33:59,247
Good luck.

462
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:52,397
Look, give us the money
and we'll talk about making a deal.

463
00:37:52,564 --> 00:37:55,859
The money is the only reason
I'm still alive.

464
00:37:56,025 --> 00:38:00,155
Oh, you mean, when they find out that
you've helped us, they're gonna kill you?

465
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:02,031
- Are you threatening my client?
- No.

466
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:06,411
I'm just assuming your client's
cooperation with this investigation.

467
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:09,706
As will everyone.

468
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,377
No? Okay.

469
00:38:14,836 --> 00:38:17,839
Enjoy your time in County, Mr. Lau.

470
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:19,507
Wait!

471
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:21,718
I won't give you the money...

472
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:24,888
...but I will give you my clients,
all of them.

473
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,390
You were a glorified accountant.

474
00:38:27,557 --> 00:38:31,394
What could you possibly have
on all of them that we could charge?

475
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:35,398
I'm good with calculation.
I handled all their investments.

476
00:38:35,565 --> 00:38:37,150
One big pot.

477
00:38:38,526 --> 00:38:39,861
Got it.

478
00:38:40,278 --> 00:38:42,113
One minute.

479
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:47,577
RICO. If they pooled their money, we can
charge them as one criminal conspiracy.

480
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:48,912
Charge them with what?

481
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:51,956
In a RICO case, if you can charge
one of them with a felony...

482
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:54,709
You can charge all of them with it.
That's great.

483
00:38:56,085 --> 00:38:58,004
Mr. Lau.

484
00:38:59,005 --> 00:39:03,009
What kind of details do you have
about this communal fund?

485
00:39:03,176 --> 00:39:04,803
- Ledgers...?
- Immunity, protection...

486
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:08,431
- ...a chartered plane back to Hong Kong.
- After you testify in open court.

487
00:39:08,598 --> 00:39:10,934
I'm just curious.
With all your clients locked up...

488
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:13,478
...what's gonna happen
with all that money?

489
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:16,773
Like I said, I'm good with calculation.

490
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:21,611
He can't go to County.
I'll keep him here in the holding cells.

491
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:24,322
What is this, Gordon, your fortress?

492
00:39:24,614 --> 00:39:27,283
Well, you trust them over at County?

493
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,285
I don't trust them here.

494
00:39:31,037 --> 00:39:32,539
Lau stays.

495
00:39:32,997 --> 00:39:37,544
Well, I don't know about Mr. Lau's travel
arrangements, but I'm sure glad he's back.

496
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,171
Put word out. We hire the clown.

497
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:46,803
He was right.
We have to fix real problem.

498
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:48,429
Batman.

499
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:56,896
- I'm not aware of any participation...
- Our boy looks good on the tube.

500
00:39:57,397 --> 00:40:00,149
You sure you wanna embarrass me
in front of my friends?

501
00:40:00,316 --> 00:40:03,987
Oh, don't worry. They're coming too.

502
00:40:10,827 --> 00:40:12,662
Have a nice trip. See you next fall.

503
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:14,789
Seven hundred twelve counts of extortion.

504
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:17,250
Eight hundred and forty-nine
counts of racketeering.

505
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:22,964
Two hundred and forty-six counts of fraud.
Eighty-seven counts of conspiracy murder.

506
00:40:23,882 --> 00:40:27,010
Five hundred and twenty-seven
counts of obstruction of justice.

507
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:28,803
How do the defendants plead?

508
00:40:35,977 --> 00:40:37,020
Order in the court.

509
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:39,689
Five hundred and forty-nine
criminals at once.

510
00:40:39,856 --> 00:40:42,358
How did you convince Surrillo
to hear this farce?

511
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:46,654
She shares my enthusiasm for justice.
After all, she is a judge.

512
00:40:46,821 --> 00:40:49,866
Even if you blow enough smoke
to get convictions out of Surrillo...

513
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:52,619
...you're gonna set
a new record at appeals.

514
00:40:52,785 --> 00:40:55,288
It won't matter.
The head guys make bail, sure.

515
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:57,874
But the midlevel guys, they can't.

516
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:02,170
They can't afford to be off the streets.
They'll cut deals that include some jail time.

517
00:41:02,337 --> 00:41:05,340
Think of all you could do
with 18 months of clean streets.

518
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:10,011
- Mr. Mayor, you can't...
- No, get out. Both of you.

519
00:41:14,182 --> 00:41:15,725
Sit down.

520
00:41:20,688 --> 00:41:23,691
The public likes you.
That's the only reason that this might fly.

521
00:41:23,858 --> 00:41:25,193
But that means it's on you.

522
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,404
They're all gonna come after you now,
and not just the Mob.

523
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:32,408
Politicians, journalists, cops.

524
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:35,078
Anyone whose wallet's
about to get lighter.

525
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:37,914
Are you up to it? You'd better be.

526
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:40,208
Because they get anything on you...

527
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:45,171
...and those criminals are back on the
streets, followed swiftly by you and me.

528
00:41:45,338 --> 00:41:46,631
Jesus!

529
00:42:07,777 --> 00:42:10,238
I think your fundraiser
will be a great success, sir.

530
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:13,074
And why do you think I wanna
hold a party for Harvey Dent?

531
00:42:13,241 --> 00:42:16,327
I assumed it was your usual reason
for socializing beyond myself...

532
00:42:16,494 --> 00:42:18,538
...and the scum of Gotham's underbelly:

533
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:20,498
To try to impress Miss Dawes.

534
00:42:20,665 --> 00:42:24,752
Very droll, but very wrong.
Actually, it's Dent.

535
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:27,799
Police released
video footage found concealed on the body.

536
00:42:27,964 --> 00:42:30,591
Sensitive viewers, be aware.
The image is disturbing.

537
00:42:30,758 --> 00:42:32,969
Tell them your name.

538
00:42:33,136 --> 00:42:34,804
Brian Douglas.

539
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:38,725
And are you the real Batman?

540
00:42:38,891 --> 00:42:39,934
- No.
- No?

541
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:42,061
- No.
- No?

542
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:43,938
Then why do you dress up like him?

543
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:50,778
Because he's a symbol that we
don't have to be afraid of scum like you.

544
00:42:50,945 --> 00:42:54,282
Yeah. You do, Brian. You really do.

545
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:58,077
Huh? Yeah.

546
00:42:58,244 --> 00:43:02,707
So you think Batman's
made Gotham a better place? Hm?

547
00:43:02,915 --> 00:43:04,459
Look at me.

548
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:06,919
Look at me!

549
00:43:10,673 --> 00:43:14,177
You see, this is how crazy
Batman's made Gotham.

550
00:43:14,343 --> 00:43:16,637
You want order in Gotham...

551
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:21,392
...Batman must take off his mask
and turn himself in.

552
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:25,354
Oh, and every day he doesn't,
people will die.

553
00:43:25,688 --> 00:43:27,815
Starting tonight.

554
00:43:28,232 --> 00:43:30,443
I'm a man of my word.

555
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:50,546
Harvey Dent,
scourge of the underworld...

556
00:43:50,713 --> 00:43:53,800
...scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade.

557
00:43:53,966 --> 00:43:55,218
- I'll be back.
- Rachel.

558
00:43:55,384 --> 00:43:58,221
A little liquid courage, Mr. Dent?

559
00:43:58,387 --> 00:44:00,807
- Thank you. Alfred, right?
- That's right, sir.

560
00:44:00,973 --> 00:44:04,268
Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her her whole life.

561
00:44:04,435 --> 00:44:05,686
Not yet, sir.

562
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,233
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends
I should be aware of?

563
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:12,652
Oh, you have no idea.

564
00:44:31,587 --> 00:44:35,550
I'm sorry that I'm late. I'm glad
to see that you all got started without me.

565
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:39,428
Now, where is Harvey? Where...?

566
00:44:39,595 --> 00:44:42,014
Harvey Dent, the man of the hour.

567
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:43,516
Where's Rachel Dawes?

568
00:44:43,683 --> 00:44:46,060
She is my oldest friend. Come here.

569
00:44:46,227 --> 00:44:50,106
When Rachel first told me she was dating
Harvey Dent, I had one thing to say:

570
00:44:50,314 --> 00:44:52,733
"The guy from those God-awful
campaign commercials?"

571
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,737
"I believe in Harvey Dent."
Yeah, nice slogan, Harvey.

572
00:44:56,904 --> 00:44:58,906
But it caught Rachel's attention.

573
00:44:59,073 --> 00:45:02,076
And then I started to pay attention
to Harvey...

574
00:45:02,493 --> 00:45:05,788
...and all that he's been doing
as our new DA.

575
00:45:05,955 --> 00:45:07,748
And you know what?

576
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:11,294
I believe in Harvey Dent.

577
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,047
I believe that on his watch,
Gotham can feel...

578
00:45:15,214 --> 00:45:18,885
...a little safer, a
little more optimistic.

579
00:45:20,303 --> 00:45:24,640
Look at this face. This is the face
of Gotham's bright future.

580
00:45:24,807 --> 00:45:26,976
To Harvey Dent. Let's hear it for him.

581
00:45:27,351 --> 00:45:28,895
Harvey.

582
00:45:38,404 --> 00:45:41,991
Harvey may not know you well enough
to understand you're making fun of him...

583
00:45:42,158 --> 00:45:44,160
- ...but I do.
- No, I meant every word.

584
00:45:45,494 --> 00:45:48,414
You know that day
that you once told me about...

585
00:45:48,581 --> 00:45:50,666
...when Gotham would no longer
need Batman?

586
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:52,752
- It's coming.
- Bruce.

587
00:45:53,586 --> 00:45:59,175
- You can't ask me to wait for that.
- It's happening now. Harvey is that hero.

588
00:45:59,342 --> 00:46:03,804
He locked up half of the city's criminals,
and he did it without wearing a mask.

589
00:46:03,971 --> 00:46:06,182
Gotham needs a hero with a face.

590
00:46:07,016 --> 00:46:09,310
You can throw a party, Wayne,
I'll give you that.

591
00:46:10,686 --> 00:46:12,605
Thanks again.

592
00:46:13,397 --> 00:46:15,107
You mind if I borrow Rachel?

593
00:46:18,569 --> 00:46:22,865
Lieutenant, that joker card pinned to the
body? Forensics found three sets of DNA.

594
00:46:23,032 --> 00:46:24,450
- Any matches?
- All three.

595
00:46:24,617 --> 00:46:28,120
The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.

596
00:46:28,287 --> 00:46:30,289
The Joker's telling us who he's targeting.

597
00:46:30,456 --> 00:46:33,334
Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.
Tell Wuertz to find Dent.

598
00:46:33,501 --> 00:46:35,544
Protective custody.
Where's the commissioner?

599
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:37,213
- City hall.
- Seal the building.

600
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,382
- No one in or out till I get there.
- Got it.

601
00:46:51,686 --> 00:46:54,063
Gordon. What are you up to?

602
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:57,483
We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor
search of the entire building.

603
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:00,236
We believe the Joker's
made a threat against your life.

604
00:47:00,403 --> 00:47:01,821
These are dangerous people.

605
00:47:01,988 --> 00:47:05,866
- You're not giving me a lot of information.
- Even we don't know where you're going.

606
00:47:06,033 --> 00:47:09,370
Take the envelope, get in, open it.
It'll tell you where you're headed.

607
00:47:13,207 --> 00:47:15,126
You can't leave me alone
with these people.

608
00:47:15,293 --> 00:47:18,337
The whole Mob's after you
and you're worried about these guys?

609
00:47:18,504 --> 00:47:20,464
Compared to this,
the Mob doesn't scare me.

610
00:47:20,631 --> 00:47:24,218
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this
for yourself, so...

611
00:47:24,385 --> 00:47:28,472
...take my word, the police commissioner
earns a lot of threats.

612
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:34,186
I found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago.

613
00:47:34,395 --> 00:47:36,647
Them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly.

614
00:47:36,814 --> 00:47:38,149
Yeah, I bet.

615
00:47:38,316 --> 00:47:42,611
Yeah. It makes you think about things
you couldn't stand losing...

616
00:47:42,778 --> 00:47:44,780
...about who you wanna
spend your life with.

617
00:47:44,947 --> 00:47:47,950
- That's a pretty big commitment.
- Not if the Mob has their way.

618
00:47:53,164 --> 00:47:55,875
You get to explain to my wife...

619
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:58,377
...why I'm late for dinner.

620
00:47:58,544 --> 00:48:01,714
Sir, the joker card
had traces of your DNA on it.

621
00:48:03,299 --> 00:48:05,926
- Don't do that.
- All right.

622
00:48:06,469 --> 00:48:09,388
- Let's be serious, then.
- Okay.

623
00:48:09,722 --> 00:48:10,765
What's your answer?

624
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:18,439
I don't have an answer.

625
00:48:20,608 --> 00:48:21,650
How'd they get my DNA?

626
00:48:21,817 --> 00:48:23,986
Somebody with access
to your office or house...

627
00:48:24,153 --> 00:48:26,781
...must have lifted a tissue
or a glass... Wait! Wait!

628
00:48:26,947 --> 00:48:29,867
- Well, I guess no answer is a no.
- Harvey.

629
00:48:30,034 --> 00:48:32,161
- It's someone else, isn't it?
- Harvey.

630
00:48:32,328 --> 00:48:35,498
Just tell me it's not Wayne.
The guy's a complete f...

631
00:48:35,998 --> 00:48:37,458
What are you doing?

632
00:48:48,677 --> 00:48:49,678
Oh, shit.

633
00:48:55,851 --> 00:48:57,603
Get a medic!

634
00:49:01,023 --> 00:49:02,149
They've come for him.

635
00:49:03,651 --> 00:49:04,819
We made it.

636
00:49:07,405 --> 00:49:08,447
Stay hidden.

637
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:14,036
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

638
00:49:16,956 --> 00:49:20,876
We are tonight's entertainment.

639
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:24,046
I only have one question:

640
00:49:24,255 --> 00:49:27,800
Where is Harvey Dent?

641
00:49:37,268 --> 00:49:39,353
You know where Harvey is?
You know who he is?

642
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,813
Hands up, pretty boy.

643
00:49:47,945 --> 00:49:50,739
Do you know where I can find Harvey?
I need to talk to him.

644
00:49:50,906 --> 00:49:53,742
Just something little, huh? No.

645
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:58,789
What's going on out there? Wayne!

646
00:50:00,249 --> 00:50:02,960
- Oh, thank God, you've got a panic room.
- Hey, wait...

647
00:50:03,544 --> 00:50:05,337
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

648
00:50:05,629 --> 00:50:07,631
You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.

649
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:11,302
We're not intimidated by thugs.

650
00:50:12,261 --> 00:50:13,971
You know...

651
00:50:15,598 --> 00:50:18,601
...you remind me of my father.

652
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:20,895
I hated my father.

653
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:23,105
Okay, stop.

654
00:50:26,942 --> 00:50:29,778
Well, hello, beautiful.

655
00:50:31,947 --> 00:50:35,784
You must be Harvey's squeeze. Hm?

656
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,662
And you are beautiful.

657
00:50:45,586 --> 00:50:49,465
You look nervous. Is it the scars?

658
00:50:50,382 --> 00:50:52,593
You wanna know how I got them?

659
00:50:53,802 --> 00:50:56,347
Come here. Hey.

660
00:50:56,722 --> 00:50:58,432
Look at me.

661
00:50:58,891 --> 00:51:03,646
So I had a wife.
She was beautiful, like you...

662
00:51:03,896 --> 00:51:08,108
...who tells me I worry too much...

663
00:51:08,275 --> 00:51:11,195
...who tells me I ought to smile more...

664
00:51:11,362 --> 00:51:16,867
...who gambles and gets in deep
with the sharks. Hey.

665
00:51:17,284 --> 00:51:19,703
One day they carve her face.

666
00:51:20,204 --> 00:51:24,458
And we have no money for surgeries.
She can't take it.

667
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:28,337
I just wanna see her smile again.

668
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:31,590
I just want her to know
that I don't care about the scars.

669
00:51:32,132 --> 00:51:33,676
So...

670
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,930
...I stick a razor in my mouth
and do this...

671
00:51:38,389 --> 00:51:39,765
...to myself.

672
00:51:40,057 --> 00:51:45,145
And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me.

673
00:51:45,312 --> 00:51:46,855
She leaves.

674
00:51:47,565 --> 00:51:49,984
Now I see the funny side.

675
00:51:50,859 --> 00:51:52,444
Now I'm always smiling.

676
00:51:55,864 --> 00:51:59,201
You got a little fight in you. I like that.

677
00:51:59,368 --> 00:52:00,703
Then you're gonna love me.

678
00:52:28,856 --> 00:52:30,065
Drop the gun.

679
00:52:30,232 --> 00:52:35,237
Oh, sure. You just take off your little mask
and show us all who you really are. Hm?

680
00:52:40,868 --> 00:52:42,077
Let her go.

681
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:44,288
Very poor choice of words.

682
00:53:07,102 --> 00:53:08,979
Are you all right?

683
00:53:11,231 --> 00:53:13,609
Let's not do that again.

684
00:53:13,901 --> 00:53:16,403
- Is Harvey okay?
- He's safe.

685
00:53:17,946 --> 00:53:19,281
Thank you.

686
00:53:19,573 --> 00:53:20,616
Jim, it's over.

687
00:53:20,783 --> 00:53:23,452
As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.

688
00:53:23,619 --> 00:53:26,664
The prosecution's over.
Nobody's standing up in front of a judge...

689
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:30,084
...while judges and police commissioners
are getting blown away.

690
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:33,295
- What about Dent?
- He's got any sense, Dent's halfway to Mex...

691
00:53:33,462 --> 00:53:35,047
So where do you keep your trash?

692
00:53:36,382 --> 00:53:40,344
You're due in court. I need you alive
long enough to get you on the record.

693
00:53:40,511 --> 00:53:43,555
You can't protect me.
You can't even protect yourselves.

694
00:53:43,722 --> 00:53:47,059
You refuse to cooperate, you're not
coming back here, you go to County.

695
00:53:47,226 --> 00:53:49,687
How long do you calculate
you'll last in there?

696
00:53:51,105 --> 00:53:54,608
Targeting me won't get their money.
I knew the Mob wouldn't go down easily...

697
00:53:54,775 --> 00:53:58,278
- ...but this is different. They crossed a line.
- You crossed the line first.

698
00:53:58,445 --> 00:54:01,865
You squeezed them, you hammered them
to the point of desperation.

699
00:54:02,032 --> 00:54:07,037
And in their desperation, they turned to
a man they didn't fully understand.

700
00:54:07,538 --> 00:54:10,082
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.

701
00:54:10,249 --> 00:54:12,459
We just need to figure out
what he's after.

702
00:54:12,626 --> 00:54:14,066
With respect, Master Wayne...

703
00:54:14,211 --> 00:54:17,172
...perhaps this is a man
you don't fully understand either.

704
00:54:17,965 --> 00:54:20,676
A long time ago, I was in Burma...

705
00:54:20,843 --> 00:54:24,263
...and my friends and I were working
for the local government.

706
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:27,015
They were trying to buy
the loyalty of tribal leaders...

707
00:54:27,182 --> 00:54:30,018
...by bribing them with precious stones...

708
00:54:30,185 --> 00:54:34,773
...but their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.

709
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:38,235
So we went looking for the stones.

710
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:43,741
But in six months, we never
met anyone who traded with him.

711
00:54:44,366 --> 00:54:48,370
One day, I saw a child
playing with a ruby...

712
00:54:48,537 --> 00:54:51,582
...the size of a tangerine.

713
00:54:51,832 --> 00:54:55,210
The bandit had been
throwing them away.

714
00:54:55,878 --> 00:54:58,589
- So why steal them?
- Because he thought it was good sport.

715
00:54:58,756 --> 00:55:03,719
Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical, like money.

716
00:55:03,886 --> 00:55:08,140
They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned or negotiated with.

717
00:55:08,557 --> 00:55:12,394
Some men just wanna
watch the world burn.

718
00:55:32,831 --> 00:55:33,999
Your name, sir?

719
00:55:34,166 --> 00:55:37,336
Eighth and Orchard.
You'll find Harvey Dent there.

720
00:55:50,224 --> 00:55:51,683
Check the names.

721
00:55:58,273 --> 00:55:59,983
"Richard Dent."

722
00:56:02,194 --> 00:56:03,278
"Patrick Harvey."

723
00:56:03,612 --> 00:56:04,613
Harvey Dent.

724
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:07,783
I need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.

725
00:56:07,991 --> 00:56:11,912
- It's because of you these guys are dead...
- Detective!

726
00:56:14,122 --> 00:56:16,166
Give us a minute, guys.

727
00:56:17,376 --> 00:56:18,961
That's brick underneath.

728
00:56:19,294 --> 00:56:21,964
- Gonna take ballistics off a shattered bullet?
- No.

729
00:56:24,216 --> 00:56:26,134
Fingerprints.

730
00:56:34,685 --> 00:56:36,603
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

731
00:56:38,397 --> 00:56:43,110
Because we found his next target.
He's put it in tomorrow's paper.

732
00:57:00,419 --> 00:57:02,713
I'm not sure
you made it loud enough, sir.

733
00:57:15,767 --> 00:57:17,936
What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?

734
00:57:18,103 --> 00:57:21,899
You wanted me to do the diligence
on the LSI Holdings deal again.

735
00:57:22,566 --> 00:57:24,860
Well, I found some irregularities.

736
00:57:25,277 --> 00:57:27,362
Their CEO is in police custody.

737
00:57:27,529 --> 00:57:30,449
No, not with their numbers, with yours.

738
00:57:30,657 --> 00:57:35,579
Applied Sciences. Whole division of Wayne
Enterprises just disappeared overnight.

739
00:57:35,746 --> 00:57:40,000
I went down to the archives
and I started pulling some old files.

740
00:57:41,126 --> 00:57:46,798
Don't tell me you didn't recognize your baby
pancaking cop cars on the evening news.

741
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:50,302
Now you got the entire R&D Department
burning through cash...

742
00:57:50,469 --> 00:57:53,805
...claiming it's related to
cell phones for the Army?

743
00:57:53,972 --> 00:57:57,059
What are you building for him now,
a rocket ship?

744
00:57:58,936 --> 00:58:00,687
I want...

745
00:58:00,854 --> 00:58:04,775
...$10 million a year
for the rest of my life.

746
00:58:07,277 --> 00:58:09,404
Let me get this straight.

747
00:58:10,614 --> 00:58:13,075
You think that your client...

748
00:58:13,241 --> 00:58:18,080
...one of the wealthiest, most powerful men
in the world, is secretly a vigilante...

749
00:58:18,246 --> 00:58:22,918
...who spends his nights beating criminals
to a pulp with his bare hands...

750
00:58:23,085 --> 00:58:26,254
...and your plan
is to blackmail this person?

751
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,013
Good luck.

752
00:58:37,891 --> 00:58:39,309
When...

753
00:58:40,727 --> 00:58:42,187
Keep that.

754
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:51,321
This is your original scan.

755
00:58:52,739 --> 00:58:55,033
Here it is reengineered.

756
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:06,795
And there's the thumbprint he left
when he pushed the round in the clip.

757
00:59:08,797 --> 00:59:09,965
I'll get you a copy.

758
00:59:10,173 --> 00:59:13,969
Mr. Wayne, did you reassign R&D?

759
00:59:14,136 --> 00:59:16,638
Yeah. Government
telecommunications project.

760
00:59:16,805 --> 00:59:18,849
Wasn't aware
we had any government contracts.

761
00:59:19,099 --> 00:59:22,102
You know, Lucius, I'm playing this one
pretty close to the chest.

762
00:59:23,228 --> 00:59:24,938
Fair enough.

763
00:59:27,858 --> 00:59:30,986
With no word from the Batman,
even as they mourn Commissioner Loeb...

764
00:59:31,153 --> 00:59:34,531
...these cops have to wonder if
the Joker will make good on his threat...

765
00:59:34,698 --> 00:59:37,909
...in the obituary column of
The Gotham Times to kill the mayor.

766
00:59:39,703 --> 00:59:43,373
I've checked all the databases.
There are four possibles.

767
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,667
Cross-reference the addresses.

768
00:59:45,834 --> 00:59:49,838
Look for Parkside,
overlooking the parade.

769
00:59:51,048 --> 00:59:52,174
I got one.

770
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:56,344
Melvin White,
1502 Randolph Apartments.

771
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,807
Aggravated assault,
moved to Arkham twice.

772
01:00:39,888 --> 01:00:41,473
What do you got on the roof?

773
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:45,185
We're tight, but frankly,
there's a lot of windows up here.

774
01:00:53,735 --> 01:00:57,781
Commissioner Loeb dedicated his life
to law enforcement...

775
01:00:57,948 --> 01:01:00,242
...and to the protection
of his community.

776
01:01:00,408 --> 01:01:02,202
I remember when I first took office...

777
01:01:02,369 --> 01:01:04,913
...and I asked if he wanted
to stay on as commissioner.

778
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:10,335
And he said he would, provided
I kept my politics out of his office.

779
01:01:14,089 --> 01:01:17,259
Clearly he was not a man who minced
words, nor should he have been.

780
01:01:18,426 --> 01:01:21,930
A number of policies that he enacted
as commissioner were unpopular.

781
01:01:22,097 --> 01:01:25,350
Policies that flooded my office
with angry calls and letters...

782
01:01:29,729 --> 01:01:31,398
- Who's that?
- What happened?

783
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,317
They took our guns.

784
01:01:34,484 --> 01:01:36,278
And our uniforms.

785
01:01:42,868 --> 01:01:45,620
And as we recognize the sacrifice
of this man...

786
01:01:45,787 --> 01:01:49,749
...we must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety.

787
01:01:49,916 --> 01:01:52,419
Stand by. Honor guard.

788
01:01:52,586 --> 01:01:56,214
Attention. Port arms.

789
01:01:57,424 --> 01:02:01,803
Ready! Aim! Fire!

790
01:02:02,596 --> 01:02:04,139
Ready! Aim!

791
01:02:07,767 --> 01:02:10,145
Ready! Aim!

792
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:19,988
Stay down! Don't move!

793
01:02:21,823 --> 01:02:23,491
Mr. Mayor. Get him out of here.

794
01:02:32,709 --> 01:02:34,961
- I'll see you later.
- Why are you going back?

795
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:48,642
Get out of here.

796
01:02:52,687 --> 01:02:54,439
Tell me what you know about the Joker.

797
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:26,805
No.

798
01:03:27,222 --> 01:03:28,556
I'm sorry, Barbara.

799
01:03:29,474 --> 01:03:32,727
Jimmy, go play with your sister.
Go ahead, honey.

800
01:03:32,894 --> 01:03:37,065
If there's anything we can do,
anything you need, we're here for you.

801
01:03:40,735 --> 01:03:41,987
Are you out there?

802
01:03:43,321 --> 01:03:47,826
Are you? You brought this
craziness on us. You did!

803
01:03:47,993 --> 01:03:50,370
You brought this on us!

804
01:03:51,413 --> 01:03:56,001
Switch it off, he ain't coming.
He doesn't wanna talk to us.

805
01:03:56,418 --> 01:03:59,421
God help whoever he does wanna talk to.

806
01:04:01,089 --> 01:04:04,009
Can't we go someplace quieter?
We can't hear each other talk.

807
01:04:04,175 --> 01:04:07,012
What makes you think
I wanna hear you talk?

808
01:04:07,178 --> 01:04:08,221
What?

809
01:04:37,625 --> 01:04:39,252
- Yeah?
- Second.

810
01:04:39,419 --> 01:04:40,462
Okay.

811
01:04:40,628 --> 01:04:42,797
- Harvey, where are you?
- Where are you?

812
01:04:42,964 --> 01:04:46,801
I'm where you should be, at Major Crimes.
I'm trying to deal with all of this mess.

813
01:04:46,968 --> 01:04:50,555
- Can I get the fingerprint analysis?
- Rachel, listen. You're not safe there.

814
01:04:50,722 --> 01:04:52,515
- This is Gordon's unit.
- Gordon's gone.

815
01:04:52,682 --> 01:04:56,269
- He vouched for these men.
- And he's gone.

816
01:05:00,899 --> 01:05:02,984
The Joker's named you next.

817
01:05:03,151 --> 01:05:06,154
God, is there someone, is there anyone
in this town we can trust?

818
01:05:06,321 --> 01:05:08,031
Bruce.

819
01:05:08,323 --> 01:05:09,491
We can trust Bruce Wayne.

820
01:05:09,657 --> 01:05:13,244
- No. Rachel, I know you're his
friend, but... Harvey, trust me.

821
01:05:13,411 --> 01:05:16,164
Bruce's penthouse is now
the safest place in the city.

822
01:05:16,331 --> 01:05:17,665
Then you go straight there.

823
01:05:17,832 --> 01:05:19,959
Don't tell anybody
and I'll find you there.

824
01:05:20,126 --> 01:05:21,836
I love you.

825
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:37,102
I want the Joker.

826
01:05:38,311 --> 01:05:39,979
From one professional to another...

827
01:05:40,146 --> 01:05:42,690
...you're trying to scare somebody,
pick a better spot.

828
01:05:42,857 --> 01:05:45,443
From this height,
the fall wouldn't kill me.

829
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:47,195
I'm counting on it.

830
01:05:54,577 --> 01:05:57,705
- Where is he?
- I don't know where he is. He found us.

831
01:05:57,872 --> 01:05:59,165
He must have friends.

832
01:05:59,499 --> 01:06:01,793
Friends? Have you met this guy?

833
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,545
Someone knows where he is.

834
01:06:03,711 --> 01:06:06,214
Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.

835
01:06:06,381 --> 01:06:07,715
They're wise to your act.

836
01:06:07,882 --> 01:06:11,886
You got rules.
The Joker, he's got no rules.

837
01:06:12,053 --> 01:06:16,933
Nobody's gonna cross him for you.
If you want this guy, you got one way.

838
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:18,893
But you already know what that is.

839
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:21,855
Just take off that mask,
let him come find you.

840
01:06:23,481 --> 01:06:27,569
Or you can let a couple more people
get killed while you make up your mind.

841
01:06:29,237 --> 01:06:31,239
You wanna play games?

842
01:06:37,579 --> 01:06:38,580
How's that feel?

843
01:06:38,746 --> 01:06:41,374
- You wouldn't.
- I wouldn't!

844
01:06:42,876 --> 01:06:44,502
You don't think I will?

845
01:06:44,669 --> 01:06:46,713
You don't think I will?

846
01:06:48,089 --> 01:06:51,301
No. No, I wouldn't.

847
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:55,054
That's why I'm not
gonna leave it up to me.

848
01:06:56,055 --> 01:06:59,058
Heads, you get to keep your head.

849
01:06:59,476 --> 01:07:01,102
Tails...

850
01:07:02,061 --> 01:07:03,104
...not so lucky.

851
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:07,025
So you wanna tell me about the Joker?

852
01:07:16,409 --> 01:07:20,121
- Let's go again.
- I don't know anything! God, don't!

853
01:07:20,288 --> 01:07:22,665
You're not playing the odds, friend.

854
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:25,793
Let's do it again.

855
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:30,465
You'd leave a man's life to chance?

856
01:07:31,216 --> 01:07:34,802
- Not exactly.
- His name's Schiff, Thomas.

857
01:07:34,969 --> 01:07:37,972
He's a paranoid schizophrenic,
former patient at Arkham.

858
01:07:38,139 --> 01:07:42,769
The kind of mind the Joker attracts.
What do you expect to learn from him?

859
01:07:46,105 --> 01:07:48,900
The Joker killed Gordon.
He's gonna kill Rachel.

860
01:07:49,067 --> 01:07:51,861
You're the symbol of hope
I could never be.

861
01:07:52,028 --> 01:07:53,863
Your stand against organized crime...

862
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:57,242
...is the first legitimate ray of light
in Gotham in decades.

863
01:07:57,408 --> 01:08:01,037
If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone.

864
01:08:01,204 --> 01:08:03,498
The criminals you arrested
would be released...

865
01:08:03,665 --> 01:08:06,751
...and Jim Gordon
will have died for nothing.

866
01:08:07,377 --> 01:08:09,629
You're gonna hold
a press conference tomorrow.

867
01:08:09,796 --> 01:08:12,173
- Why?
- No one else will die because of me.

868
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:14,676
Gotham's in your hands now.

869
01:08:14,842 --> 01:08:16,553
You can't.

870
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:18,096
You can't give in.

871
01:08:18,388 --> 01:08:20,932
You can't give in!

872
01:08:36,281 --> 01:08:37,532
Harvey called.

873
01:08:37,699 --> 01:08:40,743
He said Batman's gonna turn himself in.

874
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:42,036
I have no choice.

875
01:08:42,203 --> 01:08:45,290
You honestly think that's gonna
keep the Joker from killing people?

876
01:08:45,456 --> 01:08:48,918
Maybe not. But I have enough blood
on my hands.

877
01:08:49,377 --> 01:08:54,215
And I've seen now what I would
have to become to stop men like him.

878
01:08:54,757 --> 01:08:58,219
You once told me that
if the day came when I was finished...

879
01:08:58,386 --> 01:09:00,471
...that we'd be together.

880
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:04,350
Bruce, don't make me
your one hope for a normal life.

881
01:09:05,893 --> 01:09:07,228
Did you mean it?

882
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:10,565
Yes.

883
01:09:27,832 --> 01:09:29,626
Bruce.

884
01:09:30,585 --> 01:09:34,505
If you turn yourself in,
they're not gonna let us be together.

885
01:09:45,141 --> 01:09:48,102
- Logs as well?
- Everything.

886
01:09:48,269 --> 01:09:51,648
Anything that could lead back
to Lucius or Rachel.

887
01:09:56,986 --> 01:10:00,281
People are dying, Alfred.
What would you have me do?

888
01:10:00,448 --> 01:10:04,202
Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.

889
01:10:04,369 --> 01:10:08,081
They'll hate you for it,
but that's the point of Batman.

890
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:13,795
He can be the outcast. He can make
the choice that no one else can make.

891
01:10:13,961 --> 01:10:15,296
The right choice.

892
01:10:15,797 --> 01:10:18,841
No, today I found out
what Batman can't do.

893
01:10:19,008 --> 01:10:20,259
He can't endure this.

894
01:10:20,551 --> 01:10:23,429
Today you get to say "I told you so."

895
01:10:24,013 --> 01:10:27,183
Today, I don't want to.

896
01:10:33,022 --> 01:10:34,482
But I did bloody tell you.

897
01:10:37,527 --> 01:10:40,530
I suppose they're gonna
lock me up as well...

898
01:10:41,322 --> 01:10:42,573
...as your accomplice.

899
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:47,495
Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them
the whole thing was your idea.

900
01:10:51,749 --> 01:10:55,294
Ladies and gentlemen, I've called
this press conference for two reasons.

901
01:10:55,461 --> 01:10:57,505
Firstly, to assure the citizens
of Gotham...

902
01:10:57,672 --> 01:11:01,342
...that everything that can be done
over the Joker killings is being done.

903
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:05,805
Secondly, because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in.

904
01:11:05,972 --> 01:11:07,682
But let's consider the situation.

905
01:11:08,057 --> 01:11:10,685
Should we give in
to this terrorist's demands?

906
01:11:10,852 --> 01:11:12,311
Do we really think he's gonna...?

907
01:11:12,478 --> 01:11:15,857
You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante
than the lives of citizens?

908
01:11:16,023 --> 01:11:18,401
The Batman is an outlaw.

909
01:11:19,277 --> 01:11:23,030
That's not why we demand he turn himself
in, we're doing it because we're scared.

910
01:11:23,197 --> 01:11:25,992
We've been happy to let Batman
clean up our streets till now.

911
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:29,120
- Things are worse than ever!
- Amen.

912
01:11:30,455 --> 01:11:32,373
Yes, they are.

913
01:11:34,876 --> 01:11:37,879
But the night is darkest
just before the dawn.

914
01:11:40,339 --> 01:11:42,425
And I promise you...

915
01:11:43,217 --> 01:11:44,635
...the dawn is coming.

916
01:11:44,802 --> 01:11:49,348
One day, the Batman will have to answer
for the laws he's broken. But to us...

917
01:11:49,515 --> 01:11:51,267
...not to this madman.

918
01:11:51,434 --> 01:11:53,770
- No more dead cops!
- Yeah!

919
01:11:57,064 --> 01:11:58,649
He should turn himself in!

920
01:11:58,816 --> 01:12:01,527
- Give us the Batman! Come on!
- Where is he?

921
01:12:04,405 --> 01:12:06,574
So be it. Take the Batman into custody.

922
01:12:07,033 --> 01:12:08,993
- What?
- Is he here?

923
01:12:09,744 --> 01:12:10,745
I am the Batman.

924
01:12:11,078 --> 01:12:14,081
- What?
- Come on.

925
01:12:22,465 --> 01:12:24,383
Alfred.

926
01:12:25,718 --> 01:12:27,512
Why is he letting Harvey do this?

927
01:12:27,678 --> 01:12:30,681
- He went down to the press conference.
- I know. He just stood by.

928
01:12:30,848 --> 01:12:32,934
Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent...

929
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:36,103
...believe that Batman stands for
something more important...

930
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:38,606
...than the whims of a terrorist,
Miss Dawes...

931
01:12:38,773 --> 01:12:40,775
...even if everyone hates him for it.

932
01:12:40,942 --> 01:12:43,069
That's the sacrifice he's making.

933
01:12:43,236 --> 01:12:46,864
He's not being a hero.
He's being something more.

934
01:12:47,406 --> 01:12:49,033
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

935
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:52,286
Letting Harvey take the fall for this
is not heroic at all.

936
01:12:54,956 --> 01:12:56,582
You know him better than anyone.

937
01:12:56,999 --> 01:12:58,042
I do.

938
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:04,465
Will you give this to him for me?
When the time is right?

939
01:13:05,925 --> 01:13:07,134
How will I know?

940
01:13:07,301 --> 01:13:08,803
It's not sealed.

941
01:13:10,221 --> 01:13:11,764
Goodbye, Alfred.

942
01:13:15,935 --> 01:13:17,687
Bye, Rachel.

943
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:27,446
I didn't have time to talk this through.

944
01:13:27,613 --> 01:13:31,075
- What are you doing?
- They're transferring me to Central Holding.

945
01:13:31,367 --> 01:13:35,037
This is the Joker's chance, and when he
attacks, the Batman will take him down.

946
01:13:35,204 --> 01:13:36,747
Listen. This is too dangerous.

947
01:13:36,914 --> 01:13:40,626
We get this guy to County, he's their
problem. The streets will be cleared...

948
01:13:40,793 --> 01:13:44,505
...so let's go.
The convoys stop for no reason.

949
01:13:44,672 --> 01:13:46,132
I hope you got some moves, pal.

950
01:13:46,299 --> 01:13:50,469
He's using you as bait. He doesn't know if
he can get the Joker. He's failed so far.

951
01:13:50,803 --> 01:13:54,849
- How do you know what he's thinking?
- I just do. Anyway, this isn't just about you.

952
01:13:55,016 --> 01:14:00,021
What about the people depending on you to
clean the city up and do it honorably and...?

953
01:14:05,693 --> 01:14:08,321
Harvey. Tell everyone the truth.

954
01:14:08,696 --> 01:14:10,573
Heads, I go through with it.

955
01:14:10,781 --> 01:14:14,702
This is your life. You can't
leave something like that to chance.

956
01:14:15,077 --> 01:14:16,203
I'm not.

957
01:14:19,582 --> 01:14:22,001
You make your own luck.

958
01:14:43,814 --> 01:14:45,816
Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal.

959
01:14:53,449 --> 01:14:55,785
What the hell is that?

960
01:14:55,952 --> 01:14:58,162
Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!

961
01:14:58,329 --> 01:15:01,540
Damn it! All units divert down
onto Lower Fifth. I repeat, exit down.

962
01:15:01,958 --> 01:15:03,084
Exit down!

963
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:05,586
Lower Fifth? We'll be
like turkeys on Thanksgiving.

964
01:15:38,285 --> 01:15:40,621
Jesus. Come on, get us out of here.
Let's go.

965
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:45,167
Listen, we need backup.
We've got company.

966
01:15:45,334 --> 01:15:46,877
We got trouble, guys.

967
01:15:49,797 --> 01:15:50,881
Lock and load!

968
01:16:02,101 --> 01:16:03,477
The hell was that?

969
01:16:25,332 --> 01:16:28,002
- These are built for that, right?
- He'll need something...

970
01:16:28,169 --> 01:16:29,962
...a lot bigger to get through this.

971
01:16:31,005 --> 01:16:32,465
What is that?

972
01:16:33,799 --> 01:16:35,134
What is that, a bazooka?

973
01:16:43,768 --> 01:16:45,478
I didn't sign up for this!

974
01:17:01,827 --> 01:17:03,162
Look out.

975
01:17:03,954 --> 01:17:05,122
Look out!

976
01:17:27,394 --> 01:17:28,521
Come on, let's go!

977
01:18:15,109 --> 01:18:17,319
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent.

978
01:18:17,486 --> 01:18:20,322
Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive.

979
01:18:25,244 --> 01:18:28,831
Scanning all systems.
Scanning all systems.

980
01:18:36,297 --> 01:18:38,424
We gotta get topside.
We need air support, now!

981
01:18:43,929 --> 01:18:45,806
I like this job. I like it.

982
01:18:48,058 --> 01:18:50,686
Damage catastrophic.
Eject sequence initiated.

983
01:19:04,658 --> 01:19:06,160
Goodbye.

984
01:19:15,252 --> 01:19:18,464
We're on point, ready to give them
some of their own medicine.

985
01:19:24,845 --> 01:19:27,306
That's what I'm talking about. Air cav.

986
01:19:40,861 --> 01:19:42,571
Okay, rack them up.

987
01:19:42,738 --> 01:19:45,115
Rack them up, rack them up,
rack them up.

988
01:20:10,849 --> 01:20:12,017
That's not good.

989
01:20:15,521 --> 01:20:16,730
Okay, that's not good!

990
01:20:59,857 --> 01:21:01,942
Now, there's a Batman.

991
01:21:06,238 --> 01:21:07,448
Ooh, you wanna play. Come on.

992
01:21:10,367 --> 01:21:11,493
Come on.

993
01:21:20,627 --> 01:21:21,879
He missed!

994
01:21:35,809 --> 01:21:38,228
You can't stop here.
We're like sitting ducks!

995
01:21:55,245 --> 01:21:56,330
Come on, come on.

996
01:21:59,458 --> 01:22:02,836
Come on. Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on!

997
01:22:05,381 --> 01:22:06,840
Come on.

998
01:22:07,508 --> 01:22:10,844
Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on, hit me.

999
01:22:11,011 --> 01:22:12,638
Come on, hit me. Come on, hit me!

1000
01:22:14,765 --> 01:22:15,808
Hit me!

1001
01:22:40,791 --> 01:22:44,044
Come on, come on.

1002
01:22:44,211 --> 01:22:46,463
Could you please just give me a minute?

1003
01:22:48,549 --> 01:22:50,384
We got you, you son of a bitch.

1004
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:57,599
Gor... You do like to play things
pretty close to the chest.

1005
01:22:58,058 --> 01:22:59,768
We got him, Harvey.

1006
01:22:59,935 --> 01:23:03,397
Mr. Dent! How does it feel
to be the biggest hero in Gotham?

1007
01:23:03,564 --> 01:23:06,859
No, I'm no hero.
Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.

1008
01:23:07,025 --> 01:23:10,195
But you and your office have
been working with the Batman all along.

1009
01:23:10,362 --> 01:23:13,198
- No, but I trusted him to do the right thing.
- Which was?

1010
01:23:13,365 --> 01:23:14,408
Saving my ass.

1011
01:23:14,575 --> 01:23:17,494
All right, people, that's enough.
Let him be. Let him be.

1012
01:23:17,661 --> 01:23:19,580
Thank you, detective.

1013
01:23:19,788 --> 01:23:21,915
I've got a date
with a pretty upset girlfriend.

1014
01:23:22,082 --> 01:23:24,460
- I figured, counselor.
- Mr. Dent, sir...

1015
01:23:24,626 --> 01:23:28,755
- ...how about one for the front page, sir?
- Mr. Dent.

1016
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:43,270
Stand away! All of you!

1017
01:23:43,437 --> 01:23:46,940
I don't want anything for his Mob lawyer
to use, you understand?

1018
01:23:49,193 --> 01:23:51,069
Back from the dead.

1019
01:23:51,737 --> 01:23:53,280
I, uh...

1020
01:23:53,447 --> 01:23:55,365
...couldn't risk my family's safety.

1021
01:23:56,658 --> 01:23:58,494
What do we got?

1022
01:24:00,162 --> 01:24:04,124
Nothing. No matches on prints,
DNA, dental.

1023
01:24:04,291 --> 01:24:07,044
Clothing is custom, no labels.

1024
01:24:07,252 --> 01:24:09,379
Nothing in his pockets
but knives and lint.

1025
01:24:09,546 --> 01:24:11,465
No name.

1026
01:24:11,798 --> 01:24:13,759
- No other alias.
- Go home, Gordon.

1027
01:24:13,926 --> 01:24:17,012
The clown'll keep till morning.
Go get some rest.

1028
01:24:17,179 --> 01:24:19,014
You're gonna need it.

1029
01:24:19,264 --> 01:24:21,850
Tomorrow you take the big job.

1030
01:24:22,518 --> 01:24:25,687
You don't have any say in the matter.
Commissioner Gordon.

1031
01:24:41,537 --> 01:24:43,664
I'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety.

1032
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:51,588
Look at these ugly bastards.

1033
01:24:51,755 --> 01:24:53,675
- I don't feel good.
- You're a cop killer.

1034
01:24:53,799 --> 01:24:56,134
You're lucky to be feeling anything
below the neck.

1035
01:24:56,301 --> 01:24:57,886
- Please!
- Step away from the bars!

1036
01:24:58,053 --> 01:25:00,222
My insides hurt.

1037
01:25:14,403 --> 01:25:16,196
Did Batman save you, Daddy?

1038
01:25:18,365 --> 01:25:20,659
Actually, this time...

1039
01:25:20,826 --> 01:25:22,995
...I saved him.

1040
01:25:34,339 --> 01:25:35,966
Has he said anything yet?

1041
01:25:43,557 --> 01:25:47,769
Evening, commissioner.

1042
01:25:55,402 --> 01:25:57,613
Harvey Dent never made it home.

1043
01:25:57,779 --> 01:25:59,906
- Of course not.
- What have you done with him?

1044
01:26:00,824 --> 01:26:02,576
Me?

1045
01:26:04,202 --> 01:26:06,330
I was right here.

1046
01:26:07,748 --> 01:26:09,583
Who did you leave him with?

1047
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:12,586
Your people?

1048
01:26:13,712 --> 01:26:17,049
Assuming, of course,
that they are still your people...

1049
01:26:17,215 --> 01:26:19,926
...and not Maroni's.

1050
01:26:22,137 --> 01:26:24,514
Does it depress you, commissioner...

1051
01:26:24,931 --> 01:26:29,895
...to know just how alone you really are?

1052
01:26:31,897 --> 01:26:36,777
Does it make you feel responsible
for Harvey Dent's current predicament?

1053
01:26:36,943 --> 01:26:39,613
- Where is he?
- What's the time?

1054
01:26:40,113 --> 01:26:41,615
What difference does that make?

1055
01:26:41,865 --> 01:26:47,329
Well, depending on the time,
he may be in one spot or several.

1056
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:56,672
If we're gonna play games...

1057
01:26:59,841 --> 01:27:01,802
...I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.

1058
01:27:01,968 --> 01:27:06,056
Ah, the "good cop, bad cop" routine?

1059
01:27:06,723 --> 01:27:07,766
Not exactly.

1060
01:27:18,276 --> 01:27:22,322
Never start with the head. The victim
gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next...

1061
01:27:25,492 --> 01:27:26,618
See?

1062
01:27:26,785 --> 01:27:29,121
You wanted me. Here I am.

1063
01:27:30,163 --> 01:27:32,290
I wanted to see what you'd do.

1064
01:27:32,833 --> 01:27:35,419
And you didn't disappoint.

1065
01:27:35,585 --> 01:27:38,422
You let five people die.

1066
01:27:39,381 --> 01:27:43,051
Then you let Dent take your place.

1067
01:27:43,218 --> 01:27:45,846
- Even to a guy like me, that's cold.
- Where's Dent?

1068
01:27:46,012 --> 01:27:50,809
Those Mob fools want you gone so
they can get back to the way things were.

1069
01:27:51,309 --> 01:27:56,064
But I know the truth. There's no
going back. You've changed things.

1070
01:27:56,231 --> 01:27:58,650
- Forever.
- Then why do you wanna kill me?

1071
01:28:01,611 --> 01:28:03,029
I don't wanna kill you.

1072
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:08,076
What would I do without you?
Go back to ripping off Mob dealers? No, no.

1073
01:28:08,243 --> 01:28:10,620
No. No, you...

1074
01:28:10,787 --> 01:28:13,206
You complete me.

1075
01:28:13,373 --> 01:28:17,711
- You're garbage who kills for money.
- Don't talk like one of them. You're not.

1076
01:28:17,878 --> 01:28:20,297
Even if you'd like to be.

1077
01:28:21,548 --> 01:28:23,383
To them, you're just a freak...

1078
01:28:24,301 --> 01:28:25,635
...like me.

1079
01:28:25,802 --> 01:28:28,096
They need you right now...

1080
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:30,724
...but when they don't...

1081
01:28:31,266 --> 01:28:34,311
...they'll cast you out like a leper.

1082
01:28:34,478 --> 01:28:38,398
You see, their morals, their code...

1083
01:28:38,648 --> 01:28:40,817
...it's a bad joke.

1084
01:28:41,067 --> 01:28:44,404
Dropped at the first sign of trouble.

1085
01:28:45,071 --> 01:28:49,075
They're only as good as the world
allows them to be. I'll show you.

1086
01:28:49,242 --> 01:28:52,412
When the chips are down, these...

1087
01:28:52,579 --> 01:28:54,831
These civilized people...

1088
01:28:54,998 --> 01:28:57,083
...they'll eat each other.

1089
01:28:57,793 --> 01:29:00,170
See, I'm not a monster.

1090
01:29:01,546 --> 01:29:02,839
I'm just ahead of the curve.

1091
01:29:05,091 --> 01:29:06,176
Where's Dent?

1092
01:29:06,343 --> 01:29:09,262
You have all these rules,
and you think they'll save you.

1093
01:29:12,349 --> 01:29:14,768
- He's in control.
- I have one rule.

1094
01:29:14,935 --> 01:29:18,021
Oh. Then that's the rule you'll
have to break to know the truth.

1095
01:29:18,188 --> 01:29:19,356
Which is?

1096
01:29:19,523 --> 01:29:21,942
The only sensible way to live
is without rules.

1097
01:29:22,108 --> 01:29:24,778
And tonight you're gonna break
your one rule.

1098
01:29:24,945 --> 01:29:25,987
I'm considering it.

1099
01:29:26,154 --> 01:29:28,782
There's only minutes left,
so you'll have to play my game...

1100
01:29:28,949 --> 01:29:31,535
...if you wanna save one of them.

1101
01:29:32,035 --> 01:29:33,078
"Them"?

1102
01:29:33,245 --> 01:29:37,290
You know, for a while there,
I thought you really were Dent.

1103
01:29:37,457 --> 01:29:40,085
The way you threw yourself after her.

1104
01:29:46,383 --> 01:29:47,467
Look at you go.

1105
01:29:53,098 --> 01:29:56,685
Does Harvey know
about you and his little bunny?

1106
01:29:57,602 --> 01:29:58,979
Where are they?!

1107
01:29:59,145 --> 01:30:01,147
Killing is making a choice.

1108
01:30:01,314 --> 01:30:04,401
- Where are they?!
- Choose between one life or the other.

1109
01:30:05,151 --> 01:30:09,406
Your friend the district attorney,
or his blushing bride-to-be.

1110
01:30:14,578 --> 01:30:18,665
You have nothing,
nothing to threaten me with.

1111
01:30:19,082 --> 01:30:22,586
Nothing to do with all your strength.

1112
01:30:22,794 --> 01:30:26,214
Don't worry, I'm gonna tell you
where they are, both of them.

1113
01:30:26,381 --> 01:30:29,426
And that's the point.
You'll have to choose.

1114
01:30:30,176 --> 01:30:33,013
He's at 25052nd Street...

1115
01:30:33,179 --> 01:30:36,516
...and she's on Avenue X at Cicero.

1116
01:30:38,602 --> 01:30:40,353
- Which one you going after?
- Rachel.

1117
01:30:41,771 --> 01:30:43,189
We're getting Dent!

1118
01:30:45,442 --> 01:30:48,320
25052nd Street!

1119
01:30:51,197 --> 01:30:53,033
Hello?

1120
01:30:53,992 --> 01:30:56,369
Can anybody hear me?

1121
01:30:58,788 --> 01:31:01,416
Hello!

1122
01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:07,672
- Rachel?
- Harvey.

1123
01:31:07,839 --> 01:31:10,050
Oh, Harvey, thank God. Are you okay?

1124
01:31:10,216 --> 01:31:11,801
I'm all right. I'm in a...

1125
01:31:11,968 --> 01:31:15,555
I'm in a warehouse.
They got me wired to these oil drums.

1126
01:31:16,598 --> 01:31:17,807
I am too.

1127
01:31:18,350 --> 01:31:20,060
Harvey.

1128
01:31:27,317 --> 01:31:29,778
I want my phone call.

1129
01:31:29,945 --> 01:31:32,739
I want it. I want it. I want my phone call.

1130
01:31:33,406 --> 01:31:35,241
That's nice.

1131
01:31:36,743 --> 01:31:41,581
How many of your friends have I killed?

1132
01:31:45,335 --> 01:31:46,419
I'm a 20-year man...

1133
01:31:46,586 --> 01:31:50,048
...and I know the difference between
punks who need a lesson in manners...

1134
01:31:50,215 --> 01:31:53,093
...and the freaks like you
who would just enjoy it.

1135
01:31:53,969 --> 01:31:56,429
And you killed six of my friends.

1136
01:31:56,596 --> 01:31:57,597
Six?

1137
01:31:57,764 --> 01:32:00,266
Please. My insides hurt.

1138
01:32:00,433 --> 01:32:02,185
I don't really care. Back away.

1139
01:32:02,352 --> 01:32:05,522
The boss said he'd make the voices
go away.

1140
01:32:05,689 --> 01:32:09,234
He said he'd go inside
and replace them with bright lights...

1141
01:32:09,401 --> 01:32:10,527
...like Christmas.

1142
01:32:10,694 --> 01:32:13,238
You're out of your mind, pal. Back off.

1143
01:32:13,405 --> 01:32:16,241
Medic to the holding tank.
Come on. Get the door open.

1144
01:32:16,449 --> 01:32:17,617
You guys, back off!

1145
01:32:17,784 --> 01:32:19,953
Listen, we don't have a lot of time.

1146
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:24,124
They told me that only one of us
was gonna make it...

1147
01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:27,627
...and that they were gonna
let our friends choose.

1148
01:32:30,338 --> 01:32:32,465
Okay, Rachel.

1149
01:32:33,049 --> 01:32:36,177
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be
all right. They're coming for you.

1150
01:32:36,344 --> 01:32:40,640
Listen to me. I'll help you. Just talk me
through what's going on with you.

1151
01:32:40,807 --> 01:32:44,310
- Can you find something, anything, sharp?
- I'm trying.

1152
01:32:44,477 --> 01:32:46,646
- What's...?
- Shit.

1153
01:32:46,813 --> 01:32:48,314
Harvey?

1154
01:32:52,068 --> 01:32:53,737
Harvey, what's happening?

1155
01:33:03,079 --> 01:33:06,916
All available units,
converge at 25052nd Street.

1156
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:11,337
Do you wanna know why I use a knife?

1157
01:33:13,631 --> 01:33:14,966
Guns are too quick.

1158
01:33:15,133 --> 01:33:18,511
You can't savor all the...

1159
01:33:18,678 --> 01:33:22,015
...little emotions.

1160
01:33:23,933 --> 01:33:28,813
You see, in their last moments...

1161
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:31,274
...people show you who they really are.

1162
01:33:32,358 --> 01:33:38,031
So in a way, I knew your friends
better than you ever did.

1163
01:33:41,785 --> 01:33:45,205
Would you like to know
which of them were cowards?

1164
01:33:51,711 --> 01:33:53,379
What's that?

1165
01:33:53,588 --> 01:33:55,632
He's got some kind of a...

1166
01:33:55,799 --> 01:33:59,010
- ...contusion.
- I know you're gonna enjoy this.

1167
01:34:00,386 --> 01:34:04,140
I'm gonna have to try and enjoy it
even more.

1168
01:34:11,689 --> 01:34:12,770
Just put it down.

1169
01:34:12,899 --> 01:34:15,693
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Drop the weapon now!

1170
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:19,823
- It's my own damn fault, just shoot him!
- Let him go now! Drop it!

1171
01:34:20,115 --> 01:34:23,118
- What? Sorry?
- What do you want?

1172
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:26,079
I just want my phone call.

1173
01:34:29,082 --> 01:34:31,751
What...? What...? What's happening?

1174
01:34:31,918 --> 01:34:34,754
Just talk to me, just for one second.

1175
01:34:37,090 --> 01:34:39,759
- All right?
- Right.

1176
01:34:51,563 --> 01:34:53,606
Is that a phone?

1177
01:35:03,283 --> 01:35:04,617
Mount the curb!

1178
01:35:12,625 --> 01:35:16,629
Harvey, just in case,
I wanna tell you something, okay?

1179
01:35:16,796 --> 01:35:18,590
Don't think like that. They're coming.

1180
01:35:18,756 --> 01:35:21,050
I know they are,
but I don't want them to.

1181
01:35:25,471 --> 01:35:29,559
I don't wanna live without you,
and I do have an answer for you.

1182
01:35:29,976 --> 01:35:31,728
My answer is yes.

1183
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:37,233
No! No! No!

1184
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:40,028
Not me! Why are you coming for me?

1185
01:35:40,195 --> 01:35:41,237
No!

1186
01:35:42,906 --> 01:35:44,490
Rachel! Rachel!

1187
01:35:44,699 --> 01:35:47,035
Harvey.
- No! No! Rachel!

1188
01:35:47,202 --> 01:35:48,244
Okay.

1189
01:35:48,411 --> 01:35:49,495
Rachel!

1190
01:35:49,913 --> 01:35:51,456
No! No!

1191
01:35:51,623 --> 01:35:55,752
Harvey, it's okay. It's all right. Listen.

1192
01:35:55,919 --> 01:35:57,253
Somewh...

1193
01:36:03,134 --> 01:36:04,344
No, commissioner!

1194
01:36:04,510 --> 01:36:07,180
Rachel! No!

1195
01:36:21,527 --> 01:36:22,654
Hello there.

1196
01:36:28,534 --> 01:36:32,038
Back at the MCU, the Joker's gone.

1197
01:36:32,956 --> 01:36:34,666
With Lau?

1198
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:40,046
The Joker planned to be caught.

1199
01:36:40,380 --> 01:36:42,548
He wanted me to lock him up
in the MCU.

1200
01:37:02,193 --> 01:37:04,237
Dear Bruce:

1201
01:37:05,989 --> 01:37:08,533
I need to be honest and clear.

1202
01:37:10,576 --> 01:37:13,121
I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.

1203
01:37:13,288 --> 01:37:17,208
I love him, and I wanna spend
the rest of my life with him.

1204
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:22,171
When I told you that if Gotham no longer
needed Batman, we could be together...

1205
01:37:22,338 --> 01:37:24,549
...I meant it.

1206
01:37:24,799 --> 01:37:29,554
But now I'm sure the day won't come
when you no longer need Batman.

1207
01:37:30,596 --> 01:37:32,515
I hope it does.

1208
01:37:32,682 --> 01:37:35,435
And if it does, I will be there...

1209
01:37:35,977 --> 01:37:37,395
...but as your friend.

1210
01:37:38,104 --> 01:37:40,356
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1211
01:37:40,523 --> 01:37:42,900
I'm sorry to let you down.

1212
01:37:43,067 --> 01:37:48,072
If you lose your faith in me,
please keep your faith in people.

1213
01:37:48,656 --> 01:37:53,077
Love, now and always, Rachel.

1214
01:38:01,044 --> 01:38:03,379
Prepared a little breakfast.

1215
01:38:07,508 --> 01:38:09,427
- Very well, then.
- Alfred.

1216
01:38:09,594 --> 01:38:10,762
Yes, Master Wayne?

1217
01:38:12,138 --> 01:38:14,390
Did I bring this on her?

1218
01:38:15,433 --> 01:38:17,643
I was meant to inspire good...

1219
01:38:17,810 --> 01:38:20,188
...not madness, not death.

1220
01:38:20,355 --> 01:38:24,984
You have inspired good. But you spat
in the faces of Gotham's criminals.

1221
01:38:25,151 --> 01:38:27,236
Didn't you think
there might be casualties?

1222
01:38:27,403 --> 01:38:29,822
Things always get worse
before they get better.

1223
01:38:30,156 --> 01:38:31,616
But Rachel, Alfred.

1224
01:38:31,783 --> 01:38:35,578
Rachel believed in what you stood for...

1225
01:38:35,745 --> 01:38:37,663
...what we stand for.

1226
01:38:37,830 --> 01:38:39,290
Gotham needs you.

1227
01:38:39,832 --> 01:38:42,794
No, Gotham needs its true hero...

1228
01:38:43,294 --> 01:38:47,423
...and I let that murdering psychopath
blow him half to hell.

1229
01:38:47,590 --> 01:38:49,926
Which is why, for now...

1230
01:38:50,718 --> 01:38:52,637
...they're gonna have to
make do with you.

1231
01:38:54,847 --> 01:38:56,682
She was gonna wait for me, Alfred.

1232
01:38:58,684 --> 01:39:00,728
Dent doesn't know.

1233
01:39:00,895 --> 01:39:02,188
He can never know.

1234
01:39:04,607 --> 01:39:06,234
What's that?

1235
01:39:06,401 --> 01:39:09,362
- It can wait.
- That bandit...

1236
01:39:09,821 --> 01:39:11,948
...in the forest in Burma.

1237
01:39:12,115 --> 01:39:14,158
- Did you catch him?
- Yes.

1238
01:39:14,325 --> 01:39:15,660
How?

1239
01:39:17,078 --> 01:39:18,704
We burned the forest down.

1240
01:39:57,910 --> 01:40:00,580
He's credible, an M&A lawyer
from a leading consultancy.

1241
01:40:00,746 --> 01:40:04,125
He says he's waited as long as he can
for Batman to do the right thing.

1242
01:40:04,292 --> 01:40:06,377
Now he's taking matters
into his own hands.

1243
01:40:06,544 --> 01:40:09,505
We'll be live at 5 with
the true identity of the Batman.

1244
01:40:25,938 --> 01:40:27,565
I'm sorry about Rachel.

1245
01:40:30,276 --> 01:40:35,114
The doctor says you're in agonizing pain,
but that you won't accept medication.

1246
01:40:36,157 --> 01:40:38,117
That you're refusing to...

1247
01:40:38,284 --> 01:40:40,036
...accept skin grafts.

1248
01:40:40,369 --> 01:40:42,622
Remember that name...

1249
01:40:43,206 --> 01:40:45,541
...you all had for me...

1250
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,836
...when I was at Internal Affairs?

1251
01:40:51,297 --> 01:40:52,590
What was it, Gordon?

1252
01:40:53,257 --> 01:40:54,634
Harvey, I...

1253
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,302
Say it.

1254
01:40:57,720 --> 01:40:59,639
Say it!

1255
01:41:07,313 --> 01:41:10,399
Two-Face. Harvey Two-Face.

1256
01:41:11,984 --> 01:41:16,280
Why should I hide who I am?

1257
01:41:17,490 --> 01:41:18,824
I know you tried to warn me.

1258
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:20,910
I'm sorry.

1259
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:24,163
Wuertz picked you up.
Was he working for them?

1260
01:41:26,457 --> 01:41:28,834
Do you know who picked up Rachel?

1261
01:41:29,669 --> 01:41:32,672
Harvey, I need to know
which of my men I can trust.

1262
01:41:33,047 --> 01:41:35,174
Why would you listen to me now?

1263
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:37,969
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1264
01:41:40,513 --> 01:41:42,306
No.

1265
01:41:42,765 --> 01:41:44,892
No, you're not.

1266
01:41:45,935 --> 01:41:47,186
Not yet.

1267
01:41:52,441 --> 01:41:55,152
This craziness, it's too much.

1268
01:41:55,361 --> 01:41:58,614
Should've thought about that
before you let the clown out of the box.

1269
01:41:58,781 --> 01:42:00,533
You want him?

1270
01:42:02,994 --> 01:42:05,371
I can tell you
where he'll be this afternoon.

1271
01:42:13,379 --> 01:42:15,673
Not so crazy as you look.

1272
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:19,594
I told you, I'm a man of my word.

1273
01:42:22,805 --> 01:42:24,056
Where is the Italian?

1274
01:42:24,223 --> 01:42:27,351
All tactical units will converge
on the location in 20 minutes.

1275
01:42:27,518 --> 01:42:30,980
I want auxiliary units to cover
all possible getaway routes.

1276
01:42:31,564 --> 01:42:32,732
Please.

1277
01:42:32,898 --> 01:42:36,235
Joker-man, what you do
with all your money?

1278
01:42:36,902 --> 01:42:39,572
You see, I'm a guy of simple taste.

1279
01:42:39,739 --> 01:42:41,407
I enjoy...

1280
01:42:41,574 --> 01:42:42,950
...dynamite...

1281
01:42:43,117 --> 01:42:44,660
...and gunpowder...

1282
01:42:45,119 --> 01:42:47,538
...and gasoline.

1283
01:42:48,998 --> 01:42:51,250
What the...?

1284
01:42:53,085 --> 01:42:55,921
And you know the thing
that they have in common?

1285
01:42:56,422 --> 01:42:57,715
They're cheap.

1286
01:42:57,882 --> 01:43:00,563
How much are they
paying you to say who Batman is?

1287
01:43:00,718 --> 01:43:04,680
This is our chance. I want Lau alive.
The Joker, either way.

1288
01:43:04,847 --> 01:43:06,265
Hey, Jim. Get a load of this.

1289
01:43:06,432 --> 01:43:07,832
Let's take the next caller.

1290
01:43:07,933 --> 01:43:10,214
Harvey Dent didn't wanna
give in to this maniac.

1291
01:43:10,269 --> 01:43:11,562
You think you know better?

1292
01:43:11,729 --> 01:43:15,107
I think that if we could talk to
Dent today, he may feel differently.

1293
01:43:15,274 --> 01:43:19,362
And we wish him a speedy recovery.
Because God knows, we need him now.

1294
01:43:19,528 --> 01:43:21,739
You said you were a man of your word.

1295
01:43:22,031 --> 01:43:24,075
Oh, I am.

1296
01:43:25,785 --> 01:43:28,454
I'm only burning my half.

1297
01:43:29,789 --> 01:43:31,916
All you care about is money.

1298
01:43:32,083 --> 01:43:35,544
This town deserves
a better class of criminal...

1299
01:43:35,711 --> 01:43:37,963
...and I'm gonna give it to them.

1300
01:43:38,756 --> 01:43:41,258
Tell your men they work for me now.

1301
01:43:41,425 --> 01:43:43,803
This is my city.

1302
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:47,014
They won't work for a freak.

1303
01:43:47,181 --> 01:43:48,891
"Freak."

1304
01:43:49,058 --> 01:43:51,538
Why don't we
cut you up into little pieces...

1305
01:43:51,686 --> 01:43:53,145
...and feed you to your pooches?

1306
01:43:53,312 --> 01:43:56,190
And then we'll see how loyal
a hungry dog really is.

1307
01:43:58,192 --> 01:44:00,528
It's not about money...

1308
01:44:00,695 --> 01:44:03,906
...it's about sending a message.

1309
01:44:04,699 --> 01:44:07,159
Everything burns.

1310
01:44:09,662 --> 01:44:11,831
- Who is this?
- I had a vision...

1311
01:44:11,997 --> 01:44:14,750
...of a world without Batman.

1312
01:44:14,917 --> 01:44:17,169
The Mob ground out a little profit...

1313
01:44:17,336 --> 01:44:21,257
...and the police tried to shut them down
one block at a time.

1314
01:44:21,424 --> 01:44:24,719
And it was so boring.

1315
01:44:24,885 --> 01:44:26,846
I've had a change of heart.

1316
01:44:27,012 --> 01:44:29,640
I don't want Mr. Reese
spoiling everything...

1317
01:44:29,807 --> 01:44:34,520
...but why should I have all the fun?
Let's give someone else a chance.

1318
01:44:34,687 --> 01:44:39,525
If Coleman Reese
isn't dead in 60 minutes...

1319
01:44:39,692 --> 01:44:41,777
...then I blow up a hospital.

1320
01:44:41,944 --> 01:44:43,529
Call in every officer.

1321
01:44:43,696 --> 01:44:47,032
Tell them to head to their nearest hospital
and start evac and search.

1322
01:44:47,199 --> 01:44:51,120
Call the transit authority, school board,
prisons. Get every bus down to a hospital.

1323
01:44:51,287 --> 01:44:55,875
The priority is Gotham General. Wheel
everybody out of that place right now.

1324
01:44:56,041 --> 01:44:57,710
You, you and you, you come with me.

1325
01:44:57,877 --> 01:44:59,795
- Where are we going, sir?
- To get Reese.

1326
01:45:00,045 --> 01:45:03,174
I need you plugged in,
checking Gordon's men and their families.

1327
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:05,551
- Looking for?
- Hospital admissions.

1328
01:45:05,718 --> 01:45:07,386
Will you be wanting the Batpod?

1329
01:45:07,553 --> 01:45:09,513
In the middle of the day?
Not very subtle.

1330
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:10,973
The Lamborghini, then.

1331
01:45:11,891 --> 01:45:13,017
Much more subtle.

1332
01:45:26,864 --> 01:45:29,366
Excuse me. Let me through.
Excuse me. Okay.

1333
01:45:29,533 --> 01:45:33,037
Sir, could you help, please?

1334
01:45:33,204 --> 01:45:34,914
I'm gonna find a bus for him.

1335
01:45:36,874 --> 01:45:38,754
Sir? Commissioner, do you really think...

1336
01:45:38,918 --> 01:45:41,086
...an ordinary citizen
would try to kill this man?

1337
01:45:45,591 --> 01:45:47,927
Sir. Commissioner.

1338
01:45:50,012 --> 01:45:52,223
Get the cars around the back!

1339
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:55,935
Go. Keep rolling, Sam.

1340
01:46:01,899 --> 01:46:03,859
I see O'Brien and Richards.

1341
01:46:04,443 --> 01:46:07,947
No immediate family member
admitted to a Gotham hospital.

1342
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:12,785
- They're trying to kill me.
- Well, maybe Batman can save you.

1343
01:46:25,923 --> 01:46:28,551
Davis, they got space. Bring him out.

1344
01:46:30,219 --> 01:46:32,012
Davis.

1345
01:46:37,142 --> 01:46:39,478
I saw Burns and Zachary.

1346
01:46:39,645 --> 01:46:40,855
Nothing on them.

1347
01:46:41,021 --> 01:46:42,481
And a patrolman I don't know.

1348
01:46:43,691 --> 01:46:45,609
Okay, so, what now?

1349
01:46:46,485 --> 01:46:48,737
What do we do now?
Where are we going?

1350
01:46:51,490 --> 01:46:53,158
Send the information to Gordon.

1351
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:02,585
Get out of here.

1352
01:47:04,628 --> 01:47:06,422
Davis.

1353
01:47:09,592 --> 01:47:12,011
Ma'am, we're gonna have to
move him now.

1354
01:47:23,689 --> 01:47:26,025
- It's Berg, isn't it?
- Commissioner.

1355
01:47:27,151 --> 01:47:28,611
You okay, son?

1356
01:47:46,629 --> 01:47:48,213
Hi.

1357
01:47:53,052 --> 01:47:54,553
You know...

1358
01:47:55,387 --> 01:47:58,474
...I don't want there to be
any hard feelings between us, Harvey.

1359
01:47:58,641 --> 01:48:01,769
- When you and...
- Rachel!

1360
01:48:01,936 --> 01:48:04,229
...Rachel were being abducted...

1361
01:48:04,396 --> 01:48:07,399
...I was sitting in Gordon's cage.

1362
01:48:07,733 --> 01:48:09,652
I didn't rig those charges.

1363
01:48:09,860 --> 01:48:12,321
Your men, your plan.

1364
01:48:12,529 --> 01:48:14,990
Do I really look like a guy with a plan?

1365
01:48:15,407 --> 01:48:18,202
You know what I am?
I'm a dog chasing cars.

1366
01:48:18,827 --> 01:48:21,288
I wouldn't know what to do with one
if I caught it.

1367
01:48:21,455 --> 01:48:24,583
You know? I just do things.

1368
01:48:24,959 --> 01:48:28,671
The Mob has plans. The cops have plans.

1369
01:48:28,837 --> 01:48:31,048
Gordon's got plans.

1370
01:48:31,215 --> 01:48:34,176
You know, they're schemers.

1371
01:48:34,343 --> 01:48:38,097
Schemers trying to control
their little worlds.

1372
01:48:38,263 --> 01:48:39,765
I'm not a schemer.

1373
01:48:39,932 --> 01:48:41,558
I try to show the schemers...

1374
01:48:41,725 --> 01:48:47,022
...how pathetic their attempts
to control things really are.

1375
01:48:47,982 --> 01:48:51,026
So when I say... Ah. Come here.

1376
01:48:51,527 --> 01:48:55,072
When I say that you and your girlfriend
was nothing personal...

1377
01:48:56,615 --> 01:48:58,826
...you'll know that I'm telling the truth.

1378
01:49:01,328 --> 01:49:04,123
- I'm gonna need your weapon.
- What?

1379
01:49:07,876 --> 01:49:09,712
Why? Because my wife's in the hospital?

1380
01:49:10,421 --> 01:49:11,964
Yeah, that'd be why.

1381
01:49:12,881 --> 01:49:16,093
It's the schemers
that put you where you are.

1382
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:20,055
You were a schemer, you had plans...

1383
01:49:20,222 --> 01:49:22,391
...and look where that got you.

1384
01:49:33,152 --> 01:49:35,552
Police are taking every precaution...

1385
01:49:35,696 --> 01:49:37,823
...urging people not to
take matters into their hands.

1386
01:49:37,990 --> 01:49:40,534
I just did what I do best.

1387
01:49:40,701 --> 01:49:44,329
I took your little plan
and I turned it on itself.

1388
01:49:44,496 --> 01:49:49,835
Look what I did to this city with
a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets.

1389
01:49:50,002 --> 01:49:53,297
You know what I noticed?

1390
01:49:53,464 --> 01:49:57,009
Nobody panics when
things go "according to plan."

1391
01:49:57,176 --> 01:49:58,844
Even if the plan is horrifying.

1392
01:49:59,470 --> 01:50:04,516
If tomorrow I tell the press that, like,
a gangbanger will get shot...

1393
01:50:04,683 --> 01:50:08,145
...or a truckload of soldiers
will be blowing up...

1394
01:50:08,437 --> 01:50:09,521
...nobody panics.

1395
01:50:10,230 --> 01:50:13,317
Because it's all part of the plan.

1396
01:50:13,484 --> 01:50:18,405
But when I say that
one little old mayor will die...

1397
01:50:18,655 --> 01:50:21,075
...well, then, everyone loses their minds.

1398
01:50:24,495 --> 01:50:27,414
Introduce a little anarchy...

1399
01:50:28,582 --> 01:50:30,834
...upset the established order...

1400
01:50:31,001 --> 01:50:35,547
...and everything becomes chaos.

1401
01:50:37,382 --> 01:50:40,135
I'm an agent of chaos.

1402
01:50:40,511 --> 01:50:42,846
Oh, and you know the thing
about chaos?

1403
01:50:44,890 --> 01:50:46,517
It's fair.

1404
01:50:55,734 --> 01:50:58,904
You live.

1405
01:50:59,404 --> 01:51:01,031
You die.

1406
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:03,242
Now we're talking.

1407
01:51:12,584 --> 01:51:14,086
Mr. Reese.

1408
01:51:32,271 --> 01:51:34,439
That's Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

1409
01:51:34,606 --> 01:51:37,609
- That was a very brave thing you did.
- Trying to catch the light?

1410
01:51:37,943 --> 01:51:40,779
- You weren't protecting the van?
- Why? Who's in it?

1411
01:51:46,243 --> 01:51:48,328
Don't you think
I should go to the hospital?

1412
01:51:48,495 --> 01:51:50,998
Don't watch a whole lot of news,
do you, Mr. Wayne?

1413
01:52:57,147 --> 01:52:58,982
Southeast.

1414
01:52:59,149 --> 01:53:01,360
It's Gotham General.

1415
01:53:02,110 --> 01:53:03,830
- Did you clear the building?
- Yeah.

1416
01:53:06,782 --> 01:53:10,035
You must know how many were inside.
You have patient lists, roll call.

1417
01:53:10,202 --> 01:53:12,537
Right now we're showing
50 people missing. One bus.

1418
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:15,874
The other buses were heading off to
hospitals. I guess we missed one.

1419
01:53:16,041 --> 01:53:18,168
What's your guess
about where Harvey Dent is?

1420
01:53:18,335 --> 01:53:22,798
Keep looking. And keep it to yourself.
Anybody asks, we got him out.

1421
01:53:25,384 --> 01:53:27,803
Get me the mayor's office on the line.

1422
01:53:28,971 --> 01:53:30,722
We're gonna need the National Guard.

1423
01:53:30,889 --> 01:53:33,969
...people are still
missing, including GCN's own Mike Engel.

1424
01:53:34,059 --> 01:53:37,312
I'm now being told that we're cutting to
a video GCN has just received.

1425
01:53:37,479 --> 01:53:39,398
I'm Mike Engel for Gotham Tonight.

1426
01:53:39,898 --> 01:53:43,235
"What does it take
to make you people wanna join in?"

1427
01:53:43,402 --> 01:53:46,002
You failed to kill the lawyer.
I've gotta get you off the bench...

1428
01:53:46,154 --> 01:53:47,914
...and into the game.
Bench. Game.

1429
01:53:50,075 --> 01:53:52,202
- Come nightfall, this city is mine.
- Mine.

1430
01:53:52,369 --> 01:53:55,122
- And anyone left here plays by my rules.
- Rules.

1431
01:53:55,414 --> 01:53:58,750
Mr. Fox? Security is showing
a break-in at the R&D Department.

1432
01:53:58,917 --> 01:54:01,044
If you don't wanna be in the game...

1433
01:54:01,211 --> 01:54:02,587
- ...get out now.
- Get out now.

1434
01:54:04,756 --> 01:54:07,718
But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd
are sure in for a surprise.

1435
01:54:08,093 --> 01:54:09,803
Ha-ha, ha-ha.

1436
01:54:43,462 --> 01:54:45,714
- Gotham P.D. has shut down...
- Sweet Jesus.

1437
01:54:45,881 --> 01:54:47,382
...the area's bridges and tunnels.

1438
01:54:47,549 --> 01:54:50,969
Shouldn't you be out there,
you know, doing something?

1439
01:54:51,136 --> 01:54:53,096
It's my day off.

1440
01:54:53,722 --> 01:54:55,307
I gotta take a leak.

1441
01:54:55,474 --> 01:54:57,809
Keep an eye out for me, will you?

1442
01:55:03,398 --> 01:55:05,359
Now what?
Need someone to shake it for you?

1443
01:55:05,525 --> 01:55:07,110
Hello.

1444
01:55:07,819 --> 01:55:09,321
Dent.

1445
01:55:09,488 --> 01:55:11,698
Jesus. I thought you was dead.

1446
01:55:11,865 --> 01:55:13,533
Half.

1447
01:55:19,581 --> 01:55:21,166
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?

1448
01:55:21,333 --> 01:55:23,335
- It must've been Maroni's men.
- Shut up!

1449
01:55:25,087 --> 01:55:29,132
Are you telling me that you're gonna
protect the other traitor in Gordon's unit?

1450
01:55:29,299 --> 01:55:30,759
I don't know, he never told me.

1451
01:55:30,926 --> 01:55:34,554
Listen, Dent, I swear to God, I didn't know
what they were gonna do to you.

1452
01:55:36,098 --> 01:55:37,265
That's funny...

1453
01:55:39,017 --> 01:55:41,770
...because I don't know
what's gonna happen to you either.

1454
01:55:45,857 --> 01:55:47,818
Beautiful, isn't it?

1455
01:55:48,193 --> 01:55:49,861
Beautiful.

1456
01:55:50,404 --> 01:55:51,530
Unethical.

1457
01:55:52,697 --> 01:55:54,241
Dangerous.

1458
01:55:54,449 --> 01:55:57,953
You've turned every cell phone in Gotham
into a microphone.

1459
01:55:58,120 --> 01:56:00,539
And a high-frequency generator-receiver.

1460
01:56:00,705 --> 01:56:05,794
You took my sonar concept
and applied it to every phone in the city.

1461
01:56:05,961 --> 01:56:10,549
With half the city feeding you sonar,
you can image all of Gotham.

1462
01:56:12,467 --> 01:56:13,844
This is wrong.

1463
01:56:14,010 --> 01:56:16,054
I've gotta find this man, Lucius.

1464
01:56:18,056 --> 01:56:19,349
At what cost?

1465
01:56:19,516 --> 01:56:22,310
The database is null-key encrypted.

1466
01:56:22,477 --> 01:56:24,688
It can only be accessed by one person.

1467
01:56:26,022 --> 01:56:28,191
This is too much power for one person.

1468
01:56:28,358 --> 01:56:30,527
That's why I gave it to you.

1469
01:56:30,986 --> 01:56:32,195
Only you can use it.

1470
01:56:32,362 --> 01:56:36,158
Spying on 30 million people
isn't part of my job description.

1471
01:56:38,368 --> 01:56:42,080
This is an audio sample. If he talks
within range of any phone in the city...

1472
01:56:42,247 --> 01:56:44,458
...you can triangulate his position.

1473
01:56:44,916 --> 01:56:47,419
I'll help you this one time.

1474
01:56:47,878 --> 01:56:49,671
But consider this my resignation.

1475
01:56:49,838 --> 01:56:54,426
As long as this machine is
at Wayne Enterprises, I won't be.

1476
01:56:55,177 --> 01:56:57,095
When you're finished...

1477
01:56:57,762 --> 01:56:58,889
...type in your name.

1478
01:57:07,481 --> 01:57:10,567
My officers are going over
every inch of the tunnels and bridges...

1479
01:57:10,734 --> 01:57:13,945
...but with the Joker's threat,
they're not an option.

1480
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:16,948
- And land routes east?
- Backed up for hours.

1481
01:57:17,115 --> 01:57:20,744
Which leaves the ferries
with 30,000 ready to board.

1482
01:57:20,911 --> 01:57:23,955
I wanna use the ferries so I can
get those prisoners off the island.

1483
01:57:24,289 --> 01:57:27,083
The men you put away?
Those aren't people I'm worried about.

1484
01:57:27,250 --> 01:57:29,377
You should be.
Whatever the Joker's planning...

1485
01:57:29,544 --> 01:57:34,049
...it's a good bet Harvey's prisoners are
involved. I wanna get them out of here.

1486
01:57:35,509 --> 01:57:36,718
So where is Harvey?

1487
01:57:37,302 --> 01:57:40,472
- We haven't found him.
- Oh, Jesus.

1488
01:57:44,309 --> 01:57:46,394
How long can you keep this quiet?

1489
01:58:00,492 --> 01:58:03,161
Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.

1490
01:58:03,995 --> 01:58:06,164
Going to join your wife?

1491
01:58:09,668 --> 01:58:12,170
- You love her?
- Yes.

1492
01:58:13,046 --> 01:58:16,007
You ever imagine what it would be like
to listen to her die?

1493
01:58:16,174 --> 01:58:17,676
Look, take it up with the Joker.

1494
01:58:17,842 --> 01:58:21,096
He killed your woman. He made you...

1495
01:58:21,263 --> 01:58:22,305
...like this.

1496
01:58:22,681 --> 01:58:25,684
The Joker's just a mad dog.

1497
01:58:25,850 --> 01:58:28,478
I want whoever let him off the leash.

1498
01:58:29,187 --> 01:58:32,524
I took care of Wuertz, but who was
your other man inside Gordon's unit?

1499
01:58:32,691 --> 01:58:35,318
Who picked up Rachel?
Must have been someone she trusted.

1500
01:58:36,528 --> 01:58:38,655
Look, if I tell you...

1501
01:58:38,822 --> 01:58:39,864
...will you let me go?

1502
01:58:40,615 --> 01:58:41,950
Can't hurt your chances.

1503
01:58:44,703 --> 01:58:46,371
It was Ramirez.

1504
01:58:51,793 --> 01:58:55,046
- But you said...
- I said it couldn't hurt your chances.

1505
01:58:58,633 --> 01:59:00,760
You're a lucky man.

1506
01:59:04,222 --> 01:59:05,974
- But he's not.
- Who?

1507
01:59:08,893 --> 01:59:10,312
Your driver.

1508
01:59:23,575 --> 01:59:24,576
Stand back.

1509
01:59:24,743 --> 01:59:27,078
Hey, that ain't right.
We should be on that boat.

1510
01:59:27,245 --> 01:59:29,831
You wanna ride across
with them? Be my guest.

1511
01:59:53,063 --> 01:59:54,904
Sir, they've stopped their engines.

1512
01:59:54,939 --> 01:59:55,940
Right, get on the radio.

1513
01:59:56,107 --> 01:59:59,778
Tell them we'll come back and pick them up
once we dump the scumbags.

1514
01:59:59,944 --> 02:00:02,322
Liberty, this is Spirit. Come in.

1515
02:00:04,366 --> 02:00:05,606
What the heck was that?

1516
02:00:07,494 --> 02:00:08,953
What the...?

1517
02:00:09,496 --> 02:00:12,791
Liberty, come in, please.
This is Spirit. Come in.

1518
02:00:14,376 --> 02:00:16,294
Liberty, we have the same thing.
We've lost both engines.

1519
02:00:16,461 --> 02:00:17,962
- Liberty, come in.
- Fox.

1520
02:00:18,129 --> 02:00:20,632
There's something going on
on the ferries.

1521
02:00:21,383 --> 02:00:23,677
Get down to the engine room now.

1522
02:00:24,302 --> 02:00:26,513
Hey, buddy, what's happening?

1523
02:00:35,105 --> 02:00:38,566
Captain, we got a hundred barrels
down there rigged to blow. And this.

1524
02:00:51,663 --> 02:00:52,747
Oh, my God.

1525
02:00:52,914 --> 02:00:54,749
Looks like some kind of detonator.

1526
02:00:54,916 --> 02:00:57,794
Why would they give us
the detonator to our own bomb?

1527
02:01:00,714 --> 02:01:04,008
Tonight, you're all
gonna be a part of a social experiment.

1528
02:01:07,846 --> 02:01:11,683
Through the magic of diesel fuel
and ammonium nitrate...

1529
02:01:11,850 --> 02:01:15,937
...I'm ready right now
to blow you all sky-high.

1530
02:01:16,104 --> 02:01:18,189
Liberty, come in, over.

1531
02:01:19,649 --> 02:01:20,692
It's dead.

1532
02:01:21,025 --> 02:01:25,530
If anyone attempts
to get off their boat, you all die.

1533
02:01:25,864 --> 02:01:27,157
I'm zeroing in.

1534
02:01:27,323 --> 02:01:31,870
Each of you has a remote
to blow up the other boat.

1535
02:01:32,036 --> 02:01:34,497
His voice is on the ferry...

1536
02:01:34,664 --> 02:01:36,708
...but it's not the source.

1537
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:40,086
West.

1538
02:01:47,343 --> 02:01:49,637
I have the Joker's location.

1539
02:01:49,804 --> 02:01:50,889
Prewitt Building.

1540
02:01:51,055 --> 02:01:53,516
Assemble on the building opposite.

1541
02:01:54,893 --> 02:01:57,687
At midnight, I blow you all up.

1542
02:01:57,854 --> 02:02:03,026
If, however, one of you presses the button,
I'll let that boat live.

1543
02:02:03,193 --> 02:02:05,320
So who's it gonna be?

1544
02:02:05,487 --> 02:02:08,031
Harvey Dent's most-wanted
scumbag collection...

1545
02:02:08,198 --> 02:02:11,534
...or the sweet and innocent civilians?

1546
02:02:11,701 --> 02:02:14,245
You choose.

1547
02:02:14,412 --> 02:02:16,331
Oh, and you might wanna
decide quickly...

1548
02:02:16,498 --> 02:02:20,835
...because the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble.

1549
02:02:28,259 --> 02:02:29,260
Stay back.

1550
02:02:29,427 --> 02:02:33,223
Well, now, who are you to decide?
We ought to talk this over, at least.

1551
02:02:33,598 --> 02:02:37,185
We don't all have to die.
Those men had their chance.

1552
02:02:37,811 --> 02:02:41,606
- We are not going to talk about this.
- Why aren't we talking about it?

1553
02:02:41,773 --> 02:02:44,359
They're talking over the same thing
on the other boat.

1554
02:02:44,526 --> 02:02:46,820
- Let's put it to a vote.
- Yes!

1555
02:02:52,116 --> 02:02:54,702
- Hello?
- Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez.

1556
02:02:54,869 --> 02:02:57,914
Jim needs you to pack up
and put the kids in the car right away.

1557
02:02:58,081 --> 02:02:59,791
But the units outside...

1558
02:02:59,958 --> 02:03:01,543
Those cops can't be trusted.

1559
02:03:01,709 --> 02:03:04,671
Jim needs you away from them
as soon as possible.

1560
02:03:04,838 --> 02:03:07,799
I'll call them off for 10 minutes,
and you'll have to move fast.

1561
02:03:07,966 --> 02:03:11,803
- But where am I supposed to take them?
- 25052nd Sweet.

1562
02:03:11,970 --> 02:03:14,389
- Leave as soon as the patrol car pulls out.
- Okay.

1563
02:03:15,765 --> 02:03:17,559
She believe you?

1564
02:03:17,767 --> 02:03:19,811
It's because she trusts you...

1565
02:03:20,144 --> 02:03:21,229
...just like Rachel did.

1566
02:03:21,396 --> 02:03:23,481
- I didn't know...
- Didn't know what they'd do?

1567
02:03:23,648 --> 02:03:26,401
You're the second cop to say that to me.

1568
02:03:26,651 --> 02:03:28,778
What exactly did you think
they were gonna do?

1569
02:03:28,945 --> 02:03:31,197
They got me early on.
My mother's hospital bills...

1570
02:03:31,364 --> 02:03:34,409
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

1571
02:03:34,951 --> 02:03:37,412
You live to fight another day, officer.

1572
02:03:41,207 --> 02:03:43,048
We found the missing hospital bus.

1573
02:03:43,209 --> 02:03:44,919
Then we have a hostage situation.

1574
02:03:47,005 --> 02:03:49,007
It's a shooting gallery.

1575
02:03:49,382 --> 02:03:51,676
Why would he choose a spot
with such big windows?

1576
02:03:51,843 --> 02:03:53,723
We have clear shots on five clowns.

1577
02:03:53,845 --> 02:03:56,598
Snipers take them out,
smash the windows, a team rappels in.

1578
02:03:57,015 --> 02:03:58,516
Team moves in by the stairwells.

1579
02:03:58,683 --> 02:04:00,810
Two, three casualties max.

1580
02:04:00,977 --> 02:04:02,854
- Let's do it.
- It's not that simple.

1581
02:04:03,021 --> 02:04:05,356
- With the Joker, it never is.
- What's simple is...

1582
02:04:05,523 --> 02:04:08,693
...every second, those people on the
ferries get closer to blowing...

1583
02:04:08,860 --> 02:04:11,404
- That won't happen.
- Then he'll blow both of them up!

1584
02:04:11,571 --> 02:04:15,325
- We don't have time for paper ballots.
- I want everybody to put their votes...

1585
02:04:15,491 --> 02:04:17,493
...on this piece of paper.

1586
02:04:18,536 --> 02:04:21,372
If anyone's got pens, pass it along.

1587
02:04:21,706 --> 02:04:25,501
Thank you. Anybody else?
Coming through. Anybody else? Thank you.

1588
02:04:25,668 --> 02:04:28,546
We need to get these votes in quickly.

1589
02:04:28,713 --> 02:04:30,256
Come on.

1590
02:04:32,258 --> 02:04:34,385
What are you waiting for?
Push the button!

1591
02:04:34,552 --> 02:04:36,512
We're running out of time!

1592
02:04:37,805 --> 02:04:39,641
I need five minutes alone.

1593
02:04:39,807 --> 02:04:41,643
No! There's no time!

1594
02:04:41,809 --> 02:04:43,227
We have clear shots!

1595
02:04:43,394 --> 02:04:46,314
Dent is in there with them.
We have to save Dent!

1596
02:04:46,481 --> 02:04:48,441
I have to save Dent.

1597
02:04:48,608 --> 02:04:49,734
Get ready.

1598
02:04:52,570 --> 02:04:55,239
Two minutes, then we breach.

1599
02:05:00,828 --> 02:05:02,330
Fox, I need picture.

1600
02:05:05,375 --> 02:05:07,835
- Hello?
- Jim, we're in trouble.

1601
02:05:09,087 --> 02:05:11,381
Okay, you got POV on alpha...

1602
02:05:12,423 --> 02:05:14,384
...omni on beta.

1603
02:05:15,843 --> 02:05:19,222
Looks like clowns and hostages
on two floors.

1604
02:05:19,389 --> 02:05:21,808
There's a SWAT team on the stairwell.

1605
02:05:25,103 --> 02:05:27,730
Another SWAT team on the roof.

1606
02:05:29,273 --> 02:05:30,483
Line's clear.

1607
02:05:32,235 --> 02:05:34,946
- Barbara, calm down.
- He has the kids!

1608
02:05:35,113 --> 02:05:38,366
- Hello, Jim.
- Harvey?

1609
02:05:39,158 --> 02:05:42,370
- Where's my family?
- Where my family died.

1610
02:05:45,456 --> 02:05:47,136
Blue team, acquire the target.

1611
02:05:48,793 --> 02:05:51,379
Entry team, set your charge.

1612
02:06:07,311 --> 02:06:10,815
Fox, the SWATs are targeting the
wrong people. The clowns are the hostages.

1613
02:06:11,524 --> 02:06:13,317
Red team, go! Red team, go!

1614
02:06:17,071 --> 02:06:18,489
Entry team, blow and go!

1615
02:06:22,577 --> 02:06:23,995
Don't move.

1616
02:06:25,163 --> 02:06:26,539
Take the shot.

1617
02:06:32,170 --> 02:06:33,838
Those SWATs are coming in hot.

1618
02:06:34,005 --> 02:06:35,840
Clowns, put down your guns.

1619
02:06:36,340 --> 02:06:38,968
- Drop your weapons!
- On the ground, now!

1620
02:06:39,177 --> 02:06:42,346
Doctors, get down!
Clear the line of fire. Drop your weap...

1621
02:07:06,954 --> 02:07:08,122
Freeze!

1622
02:07:08,289 --> 02:07:10,666
Stand down or you will be...

1623
02:07:14,212 --> 02:07:15,671
Look up.

1624
02:07:16,255 --> 02:07:18,841
See those bad guys on the floor above?

1625
02:07:19,008 --> 02:07:22,011
They're waiting to ambush the SWAT team
coming up the elevator.

1626
02:07:22,470 --> 02:07:23,513
Sixty seconds.

1627
02:07:31,813 --> 02:07:36,400
The tally is 140 against, 396 for.

1628
02:07:44,534 --> 02:07:47,078
So go ahead. Do it.

1629
02:07:47,245 --> 02:07:49,247
We're still here.

1630
02:07:50,414 --> 02:07:53,376
And that means they haven't
killed us yet either.

1631
02:07:54,836 --> 02:07:56,587
Go, go, go!

1632
02:07:56,754 --> 02:07:58,548
Blue team, cover!

1633
02:08:04,053 --> 02:08:05,721
Trouble on the floor above.

1634
02:08:15,064 --> 02:08:16,440
Get down on the ground now!

1635
02:08:24,866 --> 02:08:27,285
Freeze! Stop or we will shoot.

1636
02:08:27,451 --> 02:08:29,453
We will shoot you. Drop the officer.

1637
02:08:29,620 --> 02:08:33,291
- Release the officer right now.
- Let him go now! On your knees!

1638
02:08:33,875 --> 02:08:35,960
We got him. He's out of the game.

1639
02:08:36,127 --> 02:08:38,808
- Keep your hands in the air!
- Step away from the edge!

1640
02:08:46,679 --> 02:08:48,306
Halt!

1641
02:09:01,611 --> 02:09:02,987
- Stay down!
- Don't move!

1642
02:09:03,154 --> 02:09:07,450
Be advised.
Clowns are hostages, doctors are targets.

1643
02:09:13,748 --> 02:09:15,917
Ah, you made it. I'm so thrilled.

1644
02:09:16,083 --> 02:09:19,253
- Where's the detonator?
- Go get him.

1645
02:09:32,642 --> 02:09:35,728
- Put down your weapon!
- Don't move!

1646
02:10:07,134 --> 02:10:09,011
You don't wanna die...

1647
02:10:09,178 --> 02:10:12,223
...but you don't know how to take a life.

1648
02:10:12,390 --> 02:10:14,058
Give it to me.

1649
02:10:14,350 --> 02:10:18,688
These men will kill you
and take it anyway.

1650
02:10:22,108 --> 02:10:24,610
No one wants to get their hands dirty.

1651
02:10:24,777 --> 02:10:27,738
Fine. I'll do it.

1652
02:10:29,407 --> 02:10:32,118
Those men on that boat?
They made their choices.

1653
02:10:32,285 --> 02:10:34,578
They chose to murder and steal.

1654
02:10:34,745 --> 02:10:37,957
It doesn't make any sense
for us to have to die too.

1655
02:10:47,425 --> 02:10:49,885
All the old familiar places.

1656
02:10:56,183 --> 02:10:57,268
Stand by.

1657
02:11:07,611 --> 02:11:11,198
Red team, floor secure.
Hostages are safe.

1658
02:11:11,407 --> 02:11:13,492
Give it to me.

1659
02:11:14,910 --> 02:11:18,664
You can tell them I took it by force.

1660
02:11:19,165 --> 02:11:24,086
Give it to me, and I'll do what
you should've did 10 minutes ago.

1661
02:11:46,150 --> 02:11:49,487
We really should stop this fighting,
otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.

1662
02:11:49,653 --> 02:11:51,489
There won't be any fireworks.

1663
02:11:51,906 --> 02:11:55,117
And here we go.

1664
02:12:34,448 --> 02:12:36,367
What were you trying to prove?

1665
02:12:36,534 --> 02:12:39,495
That deep down,
everyone's as ugly as you?

1666
02:12:40,621 --> 02:12:41,664
You're alone.

1667
02:12:48,254 --> 02:12:53,759
Can't rely on anyone these days.
You gotta do everything yourself. Don't we?

1668
02:12:53,968 --> 02:12:56,804
That's okay. I came prepared.

1669
02:12:57,012 --> 02:13:01,475
It's a funny world we live in. Speaking of
which, you know how I got these scars?

1670
02:13:01,642 --> 02:13:04,478
No, but I know how you got these.

1671
02:13:22,288 --> 02:13:25,040
Oh, you.

1672
02:13:25,207 --> 02:13:28,252
You just couldn't let me go, could you?

1673
02:13:29,378 --> 02:13:33,299
This is what happens
when an unstoppable force...

1674
02:13:33,466 --> 02:13:37,928
...meets an immovable object.

1675
02:13:38,512 --> 02:13:43,934
You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?

1676
02:13:44,101 --> 02:13:46,812
Huh? You won't kill me...

1677
02:13:46,979 --> 02:13:53,235
...out of some misplaced sense
of self-righteousness.

1678
02:13:53,402 --> 02:13:56,614
And I won't kill you...

1679
02:13:56,780 --> 02:14:00,576
...because you're just too much fun.

1680
02:14:01,619 --> 02:14:05,789
I think you and I are destined
to do this forever.

1681
02:14:05,956 --> 02:14:07,958
You'll be in a padded cell forever.

1682
02:14:08,125 --> 02:14:09,960
Maybe we could share one.

1683
02:14:10,127 --> 02:14:14,298
You know, they'll be doubling up, the rate this
city's inhabitants are losing their minds.

1684
02:14:14,465 --> 02:14:17,593
This city just showed you...

1685
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:21,805
...that it's full of people
ready to believe in good.

1686
02:14:21,972 --> 02:14:25,142
Until their spirit breaks completely.

1687
02:14:26,018 --> 02:14:30,856
Until they get a good look
at the real Harvey Dent...

1688
02:14:31,023 --> 02:14:33,817
...and all the heroic things he's done.

1689
02:14:35,486 --> 02:14:40,533
You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle
for Gotham's soul...

1690
02:14:40,699 --> 02:14:43,619
...in a fistfight with you?

1691
02:14:44,161 --> 02:14:45,704
No.

1692
02:14:45,871 --> 02:14:49,291
You need an ace in the hole.

1693
02:14:49,458 --> 02:14:51,085
Mine's Harvey.

1694
02:14:51,460 --> 02:14:53,170
What did you do?

1695
02:14:53,337 --> 02:14:56,340
I took Gotham's white knight...

1696
02:14:56,507 --> 02:15:00,135
...and I brought him down to our level.

1697
02:15:00,553 --> 02:15:03,514
It wasn't hard.
See, madness, as you know...

1698
02:15:03,681 --> 02:15:06,725
...is like gravity.

1699
02:15:06,892 --> 02:15:09,228
All it takes is a little push.

1700
02:15:26,161 --> 02:15:27,913
Dent!

1701
02:15:48,892 --> 02:15:53,230
This is where they brought her,
Gordon, after your men handed her over.

1702
02:15:53,981 --> 02:15:55,566
This is where she died.

1703
02:15:55,733 --> 02:15:58,068
I know, I was here...

1704
02:15:59,111 --> 02:16:01,864
- ...trying to save her.
- But you didn't.

1705
02:16:02,156 --> 02:16:05,576
- I couldn't.
- Yes, you could've. If you'd listened to me.

1706
02:16:05,743 --> 02:16:08,370
If you stood up against corruption...

1707
02:16:08,537 --> 02:16:10,748
...instead of doing your deal
with the devil.

1708
02:16:10,914 --> 02:16:12,541
I was trying to fight the Mob!

1709
02:16:13,042 --> 02:16:17,880
You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself
if you knew what I'd lost.

1710
02:16:19,173 --> 02:16:22,301
Have you ever had to talk to the person
you loved most...

1711
02:16:22,468 --> 02:16:26,347
...tell them it's gonna be all right,
when you know it's not?

1712
02:16:28,015 --> 02:16:31,894
Well, you're about to know
what that feels like, Gordon.

1713
02:16:32,645 --> 02:16:36,523
Then you can look me in the eye
and tell me you're sorry.

1714
02:16:38,275 --> 02:16:41,862
- You're not going to hurt my family.
- No.

1715
02:16:42,029 --> 02:16:44,740
Just the person you love most.

1716
02:16:52,748 --> 02:16:55,793
So is it your wife?

1717
02:16:56,877 --> 02:16:58,545
Put the gun down, Harvey.

1718
02:16:58,921 --> 02:17:00,589
Harvey, put down the gun.

1719
02:17:00,756 --> 02:17:04,301
Please. Please, Harvey. Please.

1720
02:17:05,678 --> 02:17:06,970
Oh, goddamn it.

1721
02:17:07,137 --> 02:17:09,306
Will you stop pointing that gun
at my family?

1722
02:17:09,807 --> 02:17:11,475
- No!
- We have a winner.

1723
02:17:11,642 --> 02:17:13,143
No, Jim, stop him!

1724
02:17:13,644 --> 02:17:15,479
- Harvey.
- Don't let him...

1725
02:17:15,646 --> 02:17:16,772
Harvey!

1726
02:17:18,148 --> 02:17:20,025
I'm sorry!

1727
02:17:21,819 --> 02:17:22,903
For everything.

1728
02:17:25,489 --> 02:17:27,700
Please don't hurt my son.

1729
02:17:37,835 --> 02:17:39,420
You brought your cops?

1730
02:17:39,586 --> 02:17:42,464
All they know is there's a situation.

1731
02:17:42,631 --> 02:17:45,634
They don't know who or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.

1732
02:17:45,801 --> 02:17:48,470
You think I wanna escape from this?

1733
02:17:48,637 --> 02:17:51,390
There is no escape from this.

1734
02:17:51,557 --> 02:17:53,684
You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey.

1735
02:17:55,978 --> 02:17:59,189
It's not about what I want,
it's about what's fair!

1736
02:17:59,940 --> 02:18:04,153
You thought we could be decent men
in an indecent time.

1737
02:18:06,947 --> 02:18:08,031
But you were wrong.

1738
02:18:08,741 --> 02:18:12,536
The world is cruel. And the only morality
in a cruel world...

1739
02:18:13,287 --> 02:18:15,205
...is chance.

1740
02:18:15,372 --> 02:18:17,082
Unbiased.

1741
02:18:17,291 --> 02:18:18,542
Unprejudiced.

1742
02:18:19,918 --> 02:18:21,044
Fair.

1743
02:18:21,211 --> 02:18:23,464
His son's got the same chance she had.

1744
02:18:24,214 --> 02:18:25,507
Fifty-fifty.

1745
02:18:25,674 --> 02:18:29,136
What happened to Rachel wasn't chance.
We decided to act.

1746
02:18:29,470 --> 02:18:30,804
We three.

1747
02:18:30,971 --> 02:18:34,391
Then why was it me who was
the only one who lost everything?

1748
02:18:36,894 --> 02:18:39,521
- It wasn't.
- The Joker chose me.

1749
02:18:39,688 --> 02:18:41,982
Because you were the best of us.

1750
02:18:42,149 --> 02:18:47,154
He wanted to prove that
even someone as good as you...

1751
02:18:47,321 --> 02:18:49,072
...could fall.

1752
02:18:49,406 --> 02:18:50,699
And he was right.

1753
02:18:50,866 --> 02:18:53,118
You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.

1754
02:18:53,285 --> 02:18:56,330
So point it at the people responsible.

1755
02:18:57,289 --> 02:18:59,124
Fair enough.

1756
02:19:02,461 --> 02:19:04,338
You first.

1757
02:19:16,850 --> 02:19:18,519
My turn.

1758
02:19:25,442 --> 02:19:27,444
Harvey, you're right.

1759
02:19:28,487 --> 02:19:31,114
Rachel's death was my fault.

1760
02:19:34,201 --> 02:19:36,662
Please don't punish the boy.

1761
02:19:37,746 --> 02:19:40,958
- Please, punish me.
- I'm about to.

1762
02:19:42,918 --> 02:19:44,878
Tell your boy
he's gonna be all right, Gordon.

1763
02:19:45,337 --> 02:19:46,964
Lie...

1764
02:19:47,464 --> 02:19:48,590
...like I lied.

1765
02:19:52,344 --> 02:19:53,929
It's going to be all right, son.

1766
02:20:32,342 --> 02:20:35,178
Dad? Daddy, is he okay?

1767
02:20:51,695 --> 02:20:53,864
- Thank you.
- You don't have to thank me.

1768
02:20:54,489 --> 02:20:56,283
Yes, I do.

1769
02:21:00,537 --> 02:21:01,872
The Joker won.

1770
02:21:04,291 --> 02:21:07,169
Harvey's prosecution,
everything he fought for...

1771
02:21:07,711 --> 02:21:09,463
undone.

1772
02:21:09,963 --> 02:21:14,885
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with Harvey's reputation.

1773
02:21:15,052 --> 02:21:16,219
We bet it all on him.

1774
02:21:17,554 --> 02:21:20,432
The Joker took the best of us
and tore him down.

1775
02:21:21,016 --> 02:21:22,434
People will lose hope.

1776
02:21:22,601 --> 02:21:24,353
They won't.

1777
02:21:26,855 --> 02:21:28,732
They must never know what he did.

1778
02:21:28,899 --> 02:21:30,734
Five dead.

1779
02:21:31,026 --> 02:21:34,947
- Two of them cops. You can't sweep that...
- No.

1780
02:21:39,743 --> 02:21:42,579
But the Joker cannot win.

1781
02:21:47,834 --> 02:21:51,046
Gotham needs its true hero.

1782
02:21:57,427 --> 02:22:00,472
- No.
- You either die a hero...

1783
02:22:00,639 --> 02:22:05,102
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

1784
02:22:05,268 --> 02:22:07,104
I can do those things...

1785
02:22:07,521 --> 02:22:10,565
...because I'm not a hero, not like Dent.

1786
02:22:13,568 --> 02:22:16,446
I killed those people.
That's what I can be.

1787
02:22:16,613 --> 02:22:18,532
No, no, you can't. You're not.

1788
02:22:18,699 --> 02:22:21,284
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.

1789
02:22:22,953 --> 02:22:24,079
Call it in.

1790
02:22:27,374 --> 02:22:29,126
A hero.

1791
02:22:29,292 --> 02:22:32,546
Not the hero we deserved,
but the hero we needed.

1792
02:22:33,130 --> 02:22:35,674
Nothing less than a knight...

1793
02:22:36,216 --> 02:22:37,926
...shining.

1794
02:22:38,552 --> 02:22:40,178
They'll hunt you.

1795
02:22:40,345 --> 02:22:42,139
You'll hunt me.

1796
02:22:42,639 --> 02:22:44,599
You'll condemn me.

1797
02:22:45,308 --> 02:22:47,602
Set the dogs on me.

1798
02:22:51,356 --> 02:22:53,650
Because that's what needs to happen.

1799
02:22:54,818 --> 02:22:56,737
Because sometimes...

1800
02:22:56,903 --> 02:22:59,072
...the truth isn't good enough.

1801
02:22:59,948 --> 02:23:02,242
Sometimes people deserve more.

1802
02:23:05,704 --> 02:23:09,624
Sometimes people deserve
to have their faith rewarded.

1803
02:23:28,018 --> 02:23:29,686
Batman.

1804
02:23:31,605 --> 02:23:33,356
Batman!

1805
02:23:34,149 --> 02:23:36,109
Why's he running, Dad?

1806
02:23:37,152 --> 02:23:38,487
Because we have to chase him.

1807
02:23:38,653 --> 02:23:41,531
Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!

1808
02:23:47,621 --> 02:23:49,206
He didn't do anything wrong.

1809
02:23:51,958 --> 02:23:57,547
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.

1810
02:23:58,965 --> 02:24:00,008
So we'll hunt him...

1811
02:24:03,136 --> 02:24:05,222
...because he can take it.

1812
02:24:07,724 --> 02:24:10,227
Because he's not a hero.

1813
02:24:17,776 --> 02:24:18,985
He's a silent guardian...

1814
02:24:20,153 --> 02:24:22,030
...a watchful protector.

1815
02:24:24,533 --> 02:24:25,826
A dark knight.
