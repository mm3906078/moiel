
1
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:47,988
<font size="6p">Three of a kind, let's do this.
That's it? Three guys?</font>

2
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:51,487
Two guys on the roof. Every guy gets
a share. Five shares is plenty.

3
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:54,134
Six shares.
Don't forget the guy who planned the job.

4
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:56,602
He thinks he can sit it out
and still take a slice.

5
00:01:56,743 --> 00:01:59,871
I know why they call him the Joker.
Why do they call him the Joker?

6
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:01,873
I heard he wears makeup.
Makeup?

7
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah, to scare people.
You know, war paint.

8
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:19,766
All right, everybody,
hands up, heads down!

9
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:22,935
I said, hands up, heads down!

10
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:26,064
Let's go, pal,
I'm making a withdrawal here.

11
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:27,774
I said, hands up!
No!

12
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:30,401
Here comes the silent alarm.

13
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:31,903
And there it goes.

14
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,279
Heads down!

15
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:35,782
All right, tootsie,
you're taking a dive with me.

16
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:38,618
Down! I said, stay down there!
Don't hurt me!

17
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:41,871
Funny, it didn't dial 911.
It was trying to reach a private number.

18
00:02:42,038 --> 00:02:43,958
Is it a problem?
No, I'm done here.

19
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:55,718
Sit down! Down!

20
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:58,388
Down! I said, stay down there!

21
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:05,478
Obviously we don't want you
doing anything with your hands...

22
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:08,564
other than holding on for dear life.

23
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:18,324
On the ground! Stay on the ground!

24
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:22,161
Nobody make a move!
Nobody! Stay down!

25
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:39,637
Yeah!

26
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:44,559
You have any idea
who you're stealing from?

27
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:48,438
You and your friends are dead.
He's out, right?

28
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:52,775
What...?

29
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,368
Where did you learn to count?

30
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:08,624
They wired this thing up with like
5000 volts. What kind of bank does that?

31
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,836
A Mob bank.
I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.

32
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:13,045
Where's the alarm guy?

33
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:15,772
Boss told me when the guy
was done, I should take him out.

34
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:17,216
One less share, right?

35
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:20,386
Funny, he told me something similar.

36
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:22,013
He what? No! No!

37
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:35,109
That's a lot of money.

38
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:38,988
If this Joker guy was so smart,
he'd have had us bring a bigger car.

39
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:44,327
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me
soon as we loaded the cash.

40
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:49,040
No, no, no, I kill the bus driver.

41
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:50,875
Bus driver?

42
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:54,587
What bus driver?

43
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,593
School's out. Time to go.

44
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,012
That guy's not getting up, is he?

45
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:05,431
That's a lot of money.

46
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:11,270
What happened to the rest of the guys?

47
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:20,404
You think you're smart, huh?

48
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:22,740
The guy that hired youse...

49
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,868
he'll just do the same to you.

50
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,121
Oh, criminals in this town
used to believe in things.

51
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,581
Honor...

52
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:32,458
respect.

53
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,961
Look at you.
What do you believe in, huh?

54
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,420
What do you believe in?!

55
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:41,676
I believe whatever doesn't kill you
simply makes you...

56
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:44,804
stranger.

57
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,682
<i>Mr. Mayor, you were elected
in a campaign to clean up the city.</i>

58
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:32,018
<i>When are you gonna start?
I already have.</i>

59
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:36,022
<i>Like this Batman. We're hearing he's
doing good, criminals are running scared.</i>

60
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:39,901
No, man. I don't like it tonight.
What are you, superstitious?

61
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:43,154
You got more chance of winning
the Powerball than running into him.

62
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:46,699
<i>That's not true. Our men in the
Major Crimes Unit are close to an arrest.</i>

63
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:49,827
Hey, Wuertz, mayor says
you're closing in on the Batman.

64
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:52,121
The investigation is ongoing.

65
00:06:52,288 --> 00:06:54,728
<i>The process of cleaning up
the streets is a long one.</i>

66
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:56,876
<i>I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have...</i>

67
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,507
Ever intending to see your wife again,
lieutenant?

68
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:06,344
I thought you had to
go look after your mother, detective.

69
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,471
Checked her back into the hospital.

70
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,556
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:14,352
So he hasn't shown up?
He often doesn't.

72
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:16,782
I like reminding
everybody he's out there.

73
00:07:16,794 --> 00:07:17,897
Why wouldn't he come?

74
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,066
Hopefully...

75
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,109
because he's busy.

76
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,754
That's why we bring dogs.

77
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:44,256
My little princes.
Please.

78
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:48,010
Please, they're crawling in my mouth.
Please, I beg you, get them off.

79
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,930
Look what your drugs
do to my customers.

80
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:52,723
Buyer beware.

81
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,102
I told you my compound
would take you places.

82
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:59,021
I never said they'd be places
you wanted to go.

83
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:01,732
My business, repeat customers.

84
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:05,528
You don't like what I have
to offer, you can buy from someone else.

85
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:08,447
Assuming Batman left anyone
to buy from.

86
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:15,788
My dogs are hungry.

87
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,794
Pity there's only one of you.

88
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,480
What...?
That's not him.

89
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:37,560
Loose the dogs!

90
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:51,824
That's more like it.

91
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:21,664
Don't let me find you out here again.

92
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:24,667
We're trying to help you.
I don't need help.

93
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:26,168
Not my diagnosis.

94
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:29,922
What gives you the right?
What's the difference between you and me?

95
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:32,967
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

96
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,430
Everybody back now!

97
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,769
He can't resist showing us his face.

98
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,192
What's he hiding under that makeup?

99
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,578
Uh, can we get a minute, people, please?

100
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:05,374
Him again. Who are the others?

101
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,126
Another bunch of smalltimers.

102
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,212
Some of the marked bills I gave you.

103
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:12,673
My detectives have been
making drug buys with them.

104
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,426
This bank was another drop for the Mob.
That makes five.

105
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:18,179
We found the bulk of their dirty cash.
Time to move in.

106
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:22,141
We'd have to hit all banks simultaneously.
SWAT teams, backup.

107
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,143
What about this Joker guy?

108
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,271
One man or the entire Mob? He can wait.

109
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:29,773
When the new DA hears about this,
he'll want in.

110
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,484
Do you trust him?
Be hard to keep him out.

111
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:36,113
I hear he's as stubborn as you are.

112
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:22,618
Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt.

113
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:25,496
You can swap
not sleeping in a penthouse...

114
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:27,206
for not sleeping in a mansion.

115
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:31,126
Whenever you stitch yourself up,
you do make a bloody mess.

116
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:34,296
Yeah. It makes me learn
from my mistakes.

117
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:37,883
You ought to be pretty knowledgeable
by now, then.

118
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:40,636
My armor.

119
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:44,390
I'm carrying too much weight.
I need to be... I need to be faster.

120
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,226
I'm sure Mr. Fox can oblige.

121
00:12:47,393 --> 00:12:49,895
Did you get mauled by a tiger?
It was a dog.

122
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:52,606
Huh?
It was a big dog.

123
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:56,652
There were more copycats last night,
Alfred, with guns.

124
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:58,737
Why not hire them,
take the weekend off?

125
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:01,740
That wasn't exactly
what I had in mind...

126
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:05,744
when I said I wanted to inspire people.
I know.

127
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:07,413
But things have improved.

128
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:10,082
Look at the new district attorney.

129
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:12,751
I am, closely.

130
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:14,837
Need to know if he can be trusted.

131
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:19,049
Are you interested in his character
or his social circle?

132
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,264
Who Rachel spends her time with
is her business.

133
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,310
I trust you don't have me followed
on my day off.

134
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,562
If you ever took one, I might.

135
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:35,274
Know your limits, Master Wayne.

136
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:38,569
Batman has no limits.

137
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:41,780
Well, you do, sir.
Well, can't afford to know them.

138
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:44,450
And what's gonna happen
on the day that you find out?

139
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:47,328
We all know how much you like to say
"I told you so."

140
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,831
On that day, Master Wayne,
even I won't want to.

141
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,458
Probably.

142
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:00,966
Sorry I'm late, folks.

143
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:07,097
Where were you?
Worried you'd have to step up?

144
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:10,267
Harvey, I know these briefs backwards.
Well, then...

145
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,436
fair's fair.

146
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,646
Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.

147
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,899
Yeah? You wanna
flip a coin to see who leads?

148
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:20,486
My father's lucky coin. As I recall,
it got me my first date with you.

149
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:23,822
I wouldn't leave something like that
up to chance.

150
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:27,242
I don't. I make my own luck.

151
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:32,790
All rise.
The Honorable Judge Freel presiding.

152
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,626
I thought the DA just
played golf with the mayor.

153
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:39,505
Teeoff's 1:30. More than enough time
to put you away for life, Sally.

154
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,215
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham...

155
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:44,385
someone must have stepped up
to run the so-called family.

156
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,513
Is that man in this courtroom today?

157
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:52,684
Could you identify him for us, please?
You win, counselor.

158
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,522
It was me.

159
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:02,027
I have a sworn statement from you
that this man...

160
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:05,906
Salvatore Maroni, is the new head
of the Falcone crime family.

161
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:10,202
Maroni? He's a fall guy.
I'm the brains of the organization.

162
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,146
Order.

163
00:15:12,158 --> 00:15:13,898
Permission to treat
the witness as hostile?

164
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,759
Granted.
Hostile? I'll show you hostile!

165
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:24,716
Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in China.

166
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:28,804
If you wanna kill a public servant,
Mr. Maroni, I recommend you buy American.

167
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:32,349
Get him out of here.
But, Your Honor, I'm not done.

168
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:39,356
We'll never be able to link the gun
to Maroni, so we can't charge him.

169
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,317
But they're trying to kill you,
means we're getting to them.

170
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:45,612
I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel.
I'm fine, by the way.

171
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,489
Come on, Harvey. You're Gotham's DA.

172
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:50,492
You're not getting shot at,
you're not doing your job right.

173
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:51,869
But, you know...

174
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:55,372
if you said you were rattled,
we could take the rest of the day off.

175
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:58,459
Can't. I dragged the head of
the Major Crimes Unit down here.

176
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:03,380
Oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually.
Try to be nice.

177
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:15,225
I hear you got a hell of a right cross.

178
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,647
It's a shame Sal's going to walk.

179
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:24,860
Yeah, well, good thing about the Mob
is they keep giving you second chances.

180
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:32,367
Lightly irradiated bills.

181
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:35,120
Fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help?

182
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,289
We liaise with various agencies...

183
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:39,208
Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him.

184
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:42,961
Official policy is to arrest the vigilante
known as Batman on sight.

185
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,297
Mm-hm. What about that floodlight
on the top of MCU?

186
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:47,883
If you got problems
with malfunctioning equipment...

187
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,261
I suggest you take them up
with Maintenance, counselor.

188
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:54,097
I've put every money launderer
in Gotham behind bars...

189
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,642
but the Mob
is still getting its money out.

190
00:16:56,808 --> 00:17:00,270
I think you and your friend
have found the last game in town.

191
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:03,148
You're trying to hit them
where it hurts, their wallets.

192
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:04,483
It's bold.

193
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,568
You gonna count me in?

194
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,489
In this town, the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.

195
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:12,908
I don't like that you got
your own special unit...

196
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:15,994
and it's full of cops
I investigated at Internal Affairs.

197
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,997
If I didn't work with cops
you'd investigated while at IA...

198
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:20,415
I'd be working alone.

199
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,256
I don't get political
points for being an

200
00:17:23,268 --> 00:17:25,671
idealist. I do the best
I can with what I have.

201
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:33,011
You want me to back warrants
for search and seizure on five banks...

202
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,013
without telling me what we're after.

203
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:38,684
I can give you the names of the banks.

204
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,769
Well, that's a start.

205
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,480
I'll get you your warrants,
but I want your trust.

206
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:47,484
Oh, you don't have to sell me, Dent.
We all know you're Gotham's white knight.

207
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:52,197
Yeah, well, I heard they have
a different name for me down at MCU.

208
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:54,116
I wouldn't know about that.

209
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:59,037
In China, Lau Security Investments
stands for dynamic new growth.

210
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:03,500
A joint Chinese venture with
Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.

211
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,586
Well, Mr. Lau...

212
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,714
I speak for the rest of the board...

213
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:12,217
and Mr. Wayne,
in expressing our own excitement.

214
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:20,726
Sir, I know Mr. Wayne is curious about
how his trust fund gets replenished...

215
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:23,395
but, frankly, this is embarrassing.

216
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:26,148
You worry about the diligence,
Mr. Reese.

217
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:28,609
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

218
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,319
It's done.

219
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,237
The numbers are solid.

220
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:33,947
Do them again.

221
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:37,200
Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out,
now, would we?

222
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:41,538
Another long night?

223
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:44,666
This joint venture was your idea,
and the consultants love it.

224
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:46,585
But I'm not convinced.

225
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:50,422
Lau's company has grown by
8 percent annually like clockwork.

226
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:53,008
His revenue stream
must be off the books...

227
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:54,593
maybe even illegal.

228
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,428
Okay. Cancel the deal.

229
00:18:57,763 --> 00:18:58,930
You already knew.

230
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,184
Just needed a closer look at their books.

231
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:04,394
Anything else you can trouble me for?

232
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,396
I need a new suit.

233
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:09,066
Yeah. Three buttons
is a little '90s, Mr. Wayne.

234
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:12,361
I'm not talking fashion, Mr. Fox,
so much as function.

235
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,113
You wanna be able to turn your head.

236
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,366
Sure make backing out
of the driveway easier.

237
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,368
I'll see what I can do.

238
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,083
Took three weeks
to get a reservation here.

239
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,377
I had to tell them
I work for the government.

240
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:29,199
Really?

241
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:31,213
Health inspector's not
afraid to pull strings.

242
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,590
Rachel. Fancy that.

243
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:36,259
Yeah, Bruce. Fancy that.

244
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,762
Rachel, Natascha. Natascha, Rachel.

245
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:44,309
Natascha. Are you the prima...?
Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.

246
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:47,813
Wow. Harvey's taking me next week.
Really? So you're into ballet?

247
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,315
Bruce. This is Harvey Dent.

248
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:54,403
The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel's told me everything about you.

249
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:55,779
I certainly hope not.

250
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:59,449
Let's put a couple tables together.
I'm not sure that they'll let us.

251
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:02,661
Oh, they should. I own the place.

252
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,081
How could you want to raise children
in a city like this?

253
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:08,293
Well, I was raised here.
I turned out okay.

254
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:09,960
Is Wayne Manor in
the city limits?

255
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:11,628
Is...? Heh-heh.

256
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,338
The Palisades? Sure.

257
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:17,968
You know, as our new DA, you might wanna
figure out where your jurisdiction ends.

258
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:22,097
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante.

259
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:25,642
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary citizen
standing up for what's right.

260
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,061
Gotham needs heroes like you,
elected officials...

261
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:31,523
not a man who thinks he's above the law.
Who appointed the Batman?

262
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,527
We did. All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city.

263
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:37,446
But this is a democracy, Harvey.

264
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,372
When their enemies were at the gates...

265
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:43,243
the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city.

266
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,996
It wasn't considered an honor,
it was a public service.

267
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:50,292
Harvey, the last man that they appointed to
protect the republic was named Caesar...

268
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:53,879
and he never gave up his power.
Okay, fine.

269
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,380
You either die a hero...

270
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:58,592
or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

271
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:02,262
Whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
wanna do this for the rest of his life.

272
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,682
How could he? Batman is looking for
someone to take up his mantle.

273
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:08,143
Someone like you, Mr. Dent?

274
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:11,062
Maybe. If I'm up to it.

275
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:16,485
What if Harvey Dent
is the Caped Crusader? Hm?

276
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:21,907
If I were sneaking out every night,
someone would've noticed by now.

277
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:28,413
Well, I'm sold, Dent,
and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.

278
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,416
That's nice, but I'm not
up for reelection for three years.

279
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,502
No, you don't understand.

280
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:36,463
One fundraiser with my pals...

281
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:39,257
you'll never need another cent.

282
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:56,066
What the hell is this?

283
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,529
<i>As you're all aware,
one of our deposits was stolen.</i>

284
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:04,074
<i>A relatively small amount, 68 million.</i>

285
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:06,785
Who's stupid enough to steal from us?

286
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:10,664
Two-bit wackjob,
wears a cheap purple suit and makeup.

287
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:12,791
He's not the problem. He's a nobody.

288
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:16,336
The problem is our money
being tracked by the cops.

289
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:19,005
<i>Thanks to Mr. Maroni's
well-placed sources...</i>

290
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:22,968
<i>we know that police have indeed
identified our banks using marked bills...</i>

291
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,637
and <i>are planning to
seize your funds today.</i>

292
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:29,808
<i>And since the enthusiastic new DA has
put all my competitors out of business...</i>

293
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:33,937
<i>I'm your only option.
So, what are you proposing?</i>

294
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:37,774
<i>Moving all deposits to
one secure location, not</i> a <i>bank.</i>

295
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:39,901
Where, then?
No one can know but me.

296
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:43,405
<i>If the police were to gain leverage
over one of you...</i>

297
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:45,365
<i>everyone's money would be at stake.</i>

298
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,659
What stop them getting to you?

299
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:50,912
<i>I go to Hong Kong,
far from Dent's jurisdiction...</i>

300
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:54,165
and <i>the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.</i>

301
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:55,959
<i>How soon can you move the money?</i>

302
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:57,335
<i>I already have.</i>

303
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:02,340
For obvious reasons, I couldn't wait
for your permission.

304
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:06,636
<i>Rest assured, your money is safe.</i>

305
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:18,815
Oh, hee-hee, aha.
Ha, ooh, hee, ha-ha, ha-ha.

306
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:21,234
And I thought my jokes were bad.

307
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:24,487
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
have my boy pull your head off.

308
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:25,947
How about a magic trick?

309
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:31,620
I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.

310
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:35,040
Ta-da!

311
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,708
It's...

312
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,169
It's gone.

313
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:41,880
Oh, and by the way,
the suit, it wasn't cheap.

314
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:44,883
You ought to know, you bought it.
Sit.

315
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:49,012
I want to hear proposition.

316
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:54,225
Let's wind the clocks back a year.

317
00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:00,231
These cops and lawyers
wouldn't dare cross any of you.

318
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:03,526
I mean, what happened?

319
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:07,489
Did your balls drop off? Hm?

320
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:09,699
You see, a guy like me...

321
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:12,911
A freak.
Damn right.

322
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:16,206
A guy like me... Look, listen.

323
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:21,044
I know why you choose
to have your little, ahem...

324
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:23,922
group-therapy sessions
in broad daylight.

325
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:27,217
I know why you're afraid
to go out at night.

326
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:31,096
The Batman.

327
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:36,518
See, Batman has shown Gotham
your true colors, unfortunately.

328
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:40,188
Dent, he's just the beginning.

329
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:45,527
And as for the television's
so-called plan...

330
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:47,862
Batman has no jurisdiction.

331
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:50,615
He'll find him and make him squeal.

332
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:53,785
I know the squealers when I see them...

333
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,620
and...

334
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:57,872
What do you propose?

335
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:00,458
It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.

336
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:04,754
If it's so simple, why haven't
you done it already?

337
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:07,632
If you're good at something,
never do it for free.

338
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,592
How much you want?

339
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,303
Uh, half.

340
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:17,267
You're crazy.
No, I'm not.

341
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:19,561
No, I'm not.

342
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:24,566
If we don't deal with this now...

343
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:26,359
soon...

344
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:31,489
little Gambol here won't be able
to get a nickel for his grandma.

345
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:33,616
Enough from the clown!

346
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:36,745
Ah, ta-ta-ta. Let's not blow...

347
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:39,456
Shit!
This out of proportion.

348
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:42,125
You think you can steal from us
and just walk away?

349
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:43,893
Yeah.
I'm putting the word out.

350
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,296
Five hundred grand for this clown dead.

351
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:49,507
A million alive, so I can teach him
some manners first.

352
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,386
All right. So, listen,
why don't you give me a call...

353
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:57,307
when you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously?

354
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:59,350
Here's my card.

355
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:05,440
Mm-mm.

356
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:21,831
You're a hard man to reach.

357
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:27,128
Lau's halfway to Hong Kong.

358
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:31,257
If you'd have asked,
I could have taken his passport.

359
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:34,094
All that was left in the vaults
were marked bills.

360
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,555
They knew we were coming.
As soon as your office got involved...

361
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:38,723
My office?

362
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,602
You're sitting down there with scum like
Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking...

363
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,897
Oh, yeah. I almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beat.

364
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:50,610
Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly
Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.

365
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,365
We need Lau back...

366
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:59,494
but the Chinese won't extradite
a national under any circumstances.

367
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:02,539
If I get him to you,
can you get him to talk?

368
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:03,915
I'll get him to sing.

369
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:06,835
We're going after the Mob's life savings.

370
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:08,253
Things will get ugly.

371
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,713
I knew the risk when I took this job,
lieutenant.

372
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,423
How will you get him back, any...?

373
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,427
He does that.

374
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:20,098
Our Chinese friends left town
before I could tell them the deal was off.

375
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:23,768
Well, I'm sure that you've always wanted
to go to Hong Kong.

376
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:26,104
What's wrong with a phone call?

377
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:29,899
I think Mr. Lau deserves
a more personal touch.

378
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:35,905
Now, for high-altitude jumps, you're
going to need oxygen and stabilizers.

379
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:39,701
Well, I must say,
compared to your usual requests...

380
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:42,453
jumping out of an airplane
is pretty straightforward.

381
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:45,206
What about getting back into the plane?

382
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:49,210
I'd recommend a good travel agent.
Without it landing.

383
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:53,131
Now, that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.

384
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:56,301
The CIA had a program back in the '60s...

385
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:59,804
for getting their people out
of hot spots called Sky Hook.

386
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:02,640
We could look into that.
Yeah.

387
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,475
Okay. Now...

388
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:10,982
Hardened Kevlar plates over titanium-dipped
tri-weave fibers for flexibility.

389
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:13,985
You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.

390
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:19,657
Perhaps you should
read the instructions first?

391
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:21,826
Yeah.
Now, there is a tradeoff.

392
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:25,496
Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

393
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:28,625
We wouldn't wanna make things
too easy, now, would we?

394
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:30,835
How will it hold up against dogs?

395
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:33,129
We talking rottweilers or Chihuahuas?

396
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:36,841
Should do fine against cats.

397
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:39,135
I found one in Arizona.

398
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:43,473
A very nice man said he could have it up
and running in a week, and he takes cash.

399
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,476
What about the flight crew?
South Korean smugglers.

400
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:48,853
They run flights into Pyongyang,
below radar.

401
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,773
Did you think of an alibi?
Oh, yes.

402
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:13,169
I believe this is your plane, sir.

403
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:20,885
You look tired, Alfred.
You'll be all right without me'?

404
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:26,057
If you can tell me the Russian for
"apply your own bloody suntan lotion."

405
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:41,030
Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.

406
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:43,032
They brought the body.

407
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,926
So, dead, that's 500.

408
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:05,680
How about alive? Hm?

409
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:12,061
You wanna know how I got these scars?

410
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,983
My father was...

411
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,609
a drinker...

412
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,028
and a fiend.

413
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:25,033
And one night,
he goes off crazier than usual.

414
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,244
Mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself.

415
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:29,954
He doesn't like that...

416
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:33,583
not one bit.

417
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,294
So, me watching...

418
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:41,049
he takes the knife to her,
laughing while he does it.

419
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:44,302
He turns to me and he says:

420
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:48,139
"Why so serious?"

421
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:49,974
He comes at me with the knife.

422
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,560
"Why so serious?"

423
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:57,690
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

424
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:01,944
"Let's put a smile on that face."

425
00:31:03,154 --> 00:31:05,365
And...

426
00:31:07,742 --> 00:31:09,285
Why so serious?

427
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:15,833
Now...

428
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,252
our operation is small...

429
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:21,339
but there is a lot of potential...

430
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:24,050
for aggressive expansion.

431
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:27,428
So which of you fine gentlemen
would like to join our team?

432
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:32,016
Oh. There's only one spot open right now,
so we're gonna have...

433
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,852
tryouts.

434
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,442
Make it fast.

435
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:52,286
Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.

436
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:55,164
Mr. Lau regrets he is unable
to greet you in person today.

437
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:57,250
I understand.

438
00:32:07,051 --> 00:32:10,638
For security purposes, I'm gonna have to
ask you to check in your mobile.

439
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:12,390
Of course.

440
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:18,855
I must apologize for leaving Gotham
in the middle of our negotiations.

441
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:22,567
This misunderstanding
with the Gotham police force...

442
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:25,278
I couldn't let it threaten my company.
Of course.

443
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:28,614
A businessman of your stature
will understand and...

444
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:32,743
with you here now, we can continue.

445
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,664
Well, I do appreciate you bringing me out
here in such style, Mr. Lau, but I re...

446
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:40,042
We do not allow cell phones in here.

447
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:42,920
I'm sorry. Forgot I had it.

448
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:47,717
No, I really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold.

449
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:51,345
You see, we can't afford
to be seen to do business with...

450
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:54,432
whatever it is you're accused of being.

451
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:57,185
I'm sure a businessman of your stature
will understand.

452
00:32:57,351 --> 00:33:01,272
I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone call
might have sufficed.

453
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:04,817
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think
he was deliberately wasting your time.

454
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,611
Just accidentally wasting it.

455
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:11,782
That's very good, Mr. Lau.
"Accidentally." Very good.

456
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:13,910
Hey, sir.

457
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:34,138
There's a better view from the peak tram.

458
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:36,140
How's the view from LSI Holdings?

459
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:37,975
Restricted.

460
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:40,144
Lau is holed up in there good and tight.

461
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:42,230
What's this?
I had R & D work it up.

462
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:44,065
Sends out a high-frequency pulse...

463
00:33:44,232 --> 00:33:47,068
records the response time
for mapping an environment.

464
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:50,154
Sonar. Just like a...

465
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:52,490
Submarine, Mr. Wayne. Like a submarine.

466
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,825
And the other device?
It's in place.

467
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:56,786
MT. Wayne?

468
00:33:57,995 --> 00:33:59,288
Good luck.

469
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:52,438
Look, give us the money
and we'll talk about making a deal.

470
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:55,900
The money is the only reason
I'm still alive.

471
00:37:56,066 --> 00:38:00,196
Oh, you mean, when they find out that
you've helped us, they're gonna kill you?

472
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:02,072
Are you threatening my client?
No.

473
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:06,452
I'm just assuming your client's
cooperation with this investigation.

474
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:09,747
As will everyone.

475
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:14,418
No? Okay.

476
00:38:14,877 --> 00:38:17,880
Enjoy your time in County, Mr. Lau.

477
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:19,548
Wait!

478
00:38:19,757 --> 00:38:21,759
I won't give you the money...

479
00:38:21,926 --> 00:38:24,929
but I will give you my clients,
all of them.

480
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:27,431
You were a glorified accountant.

481
00:38:27,598 --> 00:38:31,435
What could you possibly have
on all of them that we could charge?

482
00:38:31,602 --> 00:38:35,439
I'm good with calculation.
I handled all their investments.

483
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:37,191
One big pot.

484
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:39,902
Got it.

485
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:42,154
One minute.

486
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:47,618
RICO. If they pooled their money, we can
charge them as one criminal conspiracy.

487
00:38:47,785 --> 00:38:48,953
Charge them with what?

488
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,997
In a RICO case, if you can charge
one of them with a felony...

489
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:54,750
You can charge all of them with it.
That's great.

490
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:58,045
Mr. Lau.

491
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:03,050
What kind of details do you have
about this communal fund?

492
00:39:03,217 --> 00:39:04,844
Ledgers...?
Immunity, protection...

493
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:08,472
a chartered plane back to Hong Kong.
After you testify in open court.

494
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:10,975
I'm just curious.
With all your clients locked up...

495
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:13,519
what's gonna happen
with all that money?

496
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:16,814
Like I said, I'm good with calculation.

497
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:21,652
He can't go to County.
I'll keep him here in the holding cells.

498
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:24,363
What is this, Gordon, your fortress?

499
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:27,324
Well, you trust them over at County?

500
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:29,326
I don't trust them here.

501
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:32,580
Lau stays.

502
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:37,585
<i>Well, I don't know about Mr. Lau's travel
arrangements, but I'm sure glad he's back.</i>

503
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:40,212
Put word out. We hire the clown.

504
00:39:43,007 --> 00:39:46,844
He was right.
We have to fix real problem.

505
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:48,470
Batman.

506
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:56,937
I'm not aware of any participation...
Our boy looks good on the tube.

507
00:39:57,438 --> 00:40:00,190
You sure you wanna embarrass me
in front of my friends?

508
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:04,028
Oh, don't worry. They're coming too.

509
00:40:10,868 --> 00:40:12,703
Have a nice trip. See you next fall.

510
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,830
<i>Seven hundred twelve counts of extortion.</i>

511
00:40:14,872 --> 00:40:17,291
<i>Eight hundred and forty-nine
counts of racketeering.</i>

512
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:23,005
Two hundred and forty-six counts of fraud.
Eighty-seven counts of conspiracy murder.

513
00:40:23,923 --> 00:40:27,051
Five hundred and twenty-seven
counts of obstruction of justice.

514
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:28,844
How do the defendants plead?

515
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:37,061
Order in the court.

516
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:39,730
<i>Five hundred and forty-nine
criminals at once.</i>

517
00:40:39,897 --> 00:40:42,399
How did you convince Surrillo
to hear this farce?

518
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:46,695
She shares my enthusiasm for justice.
After all, she is a judge.

519
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:49,907
Even if you blow enough smoke
to get convictions out of Surrillo...

520
00:40:50,074 --> 00:40:52,660
you're gonna set
a new record at appeals.

521
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:55,329
It won't matter.
The head guys make bail, sure.

522
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:57,915
But the midlevel guys, they can't.

523
00:40:58,082 --> 00:40:59,994
They can't afford to
be off the streets.

524
00:41:00,006 --> 00:41:02,211
They'll cut deals that
include some jail time.

525
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:05,381
Think of all you could do
with 18 months of clean streets.

526
00:41:06,924 --> 00:41:10,052
Mr. Mayor, you can't...
No, get out. Both of you.

527
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:15,766
Sit down.

528
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:23,732
The public likes you.
That's the only reason that this might fly.

529
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:25,234
But that means it's on you.

530
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:28,445
They're all gonna come after you now,
and not just the Mob.

531
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:32,449
Politicians, journalists, cops.

532
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:35,119
Anyone whose wallet's
about to get lighter.

533
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,955
Are you up to it? You'd better be.

534
00:41:38,122 --> 00:41:40,249
Because they get anything on you...

535
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:45,212
and those criminals are back on the
streets, followed swiftly by you and me.

536
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:46,672
Jesus!

537
00:42:07,818 --> 00:42:10,279
I think your fundraiser
will be a great success, sir.

538
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:13,115
And why do you think I wanna
hold a party for Harvey Dent?

539
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:16,368
I assumed it was your usual reason
for socializing beyond myself...

540
00:42:16,535 --> 00:42:18,579
and the scum of Gotham's underbelly:

541
00:42:18,746 --> 00:42:20,539
To try to impress Miss Dawes.

542
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:24,793
Very droll, but very wrong.
Actually, it's Dent.

543
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,840
<i>Police released
video footage found concealed on the body.</i>

544
00:42:28,005 --> 00:42:30,632
<i>Sensitive viewers, be aware.
The image is disturbing.</i>

545
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:33,010
Tell them your name.

546
00:42:33,177 --> 00:42:34,845
<i>Brian Douglas.</i>

547
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,766
<i>And are you the real Batman?</i>

548
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:39,975
No.
No?

549
00:42:40,142 --> 00:42:42,102
<i>No.
No?</i>

550
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:43,979
<i>Then why do you dress up like him?</i>

551
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:46,523
<i>Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!</i>

552
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:50,819
<i>Because he's a symbol that we
don't have to be afraid of scum like you.</i>

553
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:54,323
<i>Yeah. You do, Brian. You really do.</i>

554
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:58,118
<i>Huh? Yeah. Oh, shh, shh, shh.</i>

555
00:42:58,285 --> 00:43:02,748
<i>So you think Batman's
made Gotham a better place? Hm?</i>

556
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:04,500
<i>Look at me.</i>

557
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:06,960
<i>Look at me!</i>

558
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:14,218
<i>You see, this is how crazy
Batman's made Gotham.</i>

559
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:16,678
<i>You want order in Gotham...</i>

560
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:21,433
<i>Batman must take off his mask
and turn himself in.</i>

561
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,395
<i>Oh, and every day he doesn't,
people will die.</i>

562
00:43:25,729 --> 00:43:27,856
<i>Starting tonight.</i>

563
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:30,484
<i>I'm a man of my word.</i>

564
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:50,587
Harvey Dent,
scourge of the underworld...

565
00:43:50,754 --> 00:43:53,841
scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade.

566
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:55,259
<i>I'll</i> be back.
Rachel.

567
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:58,262
A little liquid courage, Mr. Dent?

568
00:43:58,428 --> 00:44:00,848
Thank you. Alfred, right?
That's right, sir.

569
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:04,309
Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her her whole life.

570
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:05,727
Not yet, sir.

571
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:10,274
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends
I should be aware of?

572
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,693
Oh, you have no idea.

573
00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:35,591
I'm sorry that I'm late. I'm glad
to see that you all got started without me.

574
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:39,469
Now, where is Harvey? Where...?

575
00:44:39,636 --> 00:44:42,055
Harvey Dent, the man of the hour.

576
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:43,557
Where's Rachel Dawes?

577
00:44:43,724 --> 00:44:46,101
She is my oldest friend. Come here.

578
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:50,147
When Rachel first told me she was dating
Harvey Dent, I had one thing to say:

579
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:52,774
"The guy from those God-awful
campaign commercials?"

580
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:56,778
"I believe in Harvey Dent."
Yeah, nice slogan, Harvey.

581
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:58,947
But it caught Rachel's attention.

582
00:44:59,114 --> 00:45:02,117
And then I started to pay attention
to Harvey...

583
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:05,829
and all that he's been doing
as our new DA.

584
00:45:05,996 --> 00:45:07,789
And you know what?

585
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:11,335
I believe in Harvey Dent.

586
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:15,088
I believe that on his watch,
Gotham can feel...

587
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:18,926
a little safer, a
little more optimistic.

588
00:45:20,344 --> 00:45:24,681
Look at this face. This is the face
of Gotham's bright future.

589
00:45:24,848 --> 00:45:27,017
To Harvey Dent. Let's hear it for him.

590
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:28,936
Harvey.

591
00:45:38,445 --> 00:45:42,032
Harvey may not know you well enough
to understand you're making fun of him...

592
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:44,201
but I do.
No, I meant every word.

593
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:48,455
You know that day
that you once told me about...

594
00:45:48,622 --> 00:45:50,707
when Gotham would no longer
need Batman?

595
00:45:50,874 --> 00:45:52,793
It's coming.
Bruce.

596
00:45:53,627 --> 00:45:59,216
You can't ask me to wait for that.
It's happening now. Harvey is that hero.

597
00:45:59,383 --> 00:46:03,845
He locked up half of the city's criminals,
and he did it without wearing a mask.

598
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:06,223
Gotham needs a hero with a face.

599
00:46:07,057 --> 00:46:09,351
You can throw a party, Wayne,
I'll give you that.

600
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:12,646
Thanks again.

601
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:15,148
You mind if I borrow Rachel?

602
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:22,906
Lieutenant, that joker card pinned to the
body? Forensics found three sets of DNA.

603
00:46:23,073 --> 00:46:24,491
Any matches?
All three.

604
00:46:24,658 --> 00:46:28,161
The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.

605
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:30,330
The Joker's telling us who he's targeting.

606
00:46:30,497 --> 00:46:33,375
Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.
Tell Wuertz to find Dent.

607
00:46:33,542 --> 00:46:35,585
Protective custody.
Where's the commissioner?

608
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:37,254
City hall.
Seal the building.

609
00:46:37,421 --> 00:46:39,423
No one in or out till I get there.
Got it.

610
00:46:51,727 --> 00:46:54,104
Gordon. What are you up to?

611
00:46:54,271 --> 00:46:57,524
We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor
search of the entire building.

612
00:46:57,691 --> 00:47:00,277
We believe the Joker's
made a threat against your life.

613
00:47:00,444 --> 00:47:01,862
These are dangerous people.

614
00:47:02,029 --> 00:47:04,046
You're not giving me
a lot of information.

615
00:47:04,058 --> 00:47:05,907
Even we don't know
where you're going.

616
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:09,411
Take the envelope, get in, open it.
It'll tell you where you're headed.

617
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:15,167
You can't leave me alone
with these people.

618
00:47:15,334 --> 00:47:18,378
The whole Mob's after you
and you're worried about these guys?

619
00:47:18,545 --> 00:47:20,505
Compared to this,
the Mob doesn't scare me.

620
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:24,259
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this
for yourself, so...

621
00:47:24,426 --> 00:47:28,513
take my word, the police commissioner
earns a lot of threats.

622
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:34,227
I found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago.

623
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:36,688
Them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly.

624
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:38,190
Yeah, I bet.

625
00:47:38,357 --> 00:47:42,652
Yeah. It makes you think about things
you couldn't stand losing...

626
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:44,821
about who you wanna
spend your life with.

627
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:47,991
That's a pretty big commitment.
Not if the Mob has their way.

628
00:47:53,205 --> 00:47:55,916
You get to explain to my wife...

629
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:58,418
why I'm late for dinner.

630
00:47:58,585 --> 00:48:01,755
Sir, the joker card
had traces of your DNA on it.

631
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,967
Don't do that.
All right.

632
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:09,429
Let's be serious, then.
Okay.

633
00:48:09,763 --> 00:48:10,806
What's your answer?

634
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:18,480
I don't have an answer.

635
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:21,691
How'd they get my DNA?

636
00:48:21,858 --> 00:48:24,027
Somebody with access
to your office or house...

637
00:48:24,194 --> 00:48:26,822
must have lifted a tissue
or a glass... Wait! Wait!

638
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:29,908
Well, I guess no answer is a no.
Harvey.

639
00:48:30,075 --> 00:48:32,202
It's someone else, isn't it?
Harvey.

640
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:35,539
Just tell me it's not Wayne.
The guy's a complete f...

641
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:37,499
What are you doing?

642
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:49,719
Oh, shit.

643
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:57,644
Get a medic!

644
00:49:01,064 --> 00:49:02,190
They've come for him.

645
00:49:03,692 --> 00:49:04,860
We made it.

646
00:49:07,446 --> 00:49:08,488
Stay hidden.

647
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:14,077
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

648
00:49:16,997 --> 00:49:20,917
We are tonight's entertainment.

649
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:24,087
I only have one question:

650
00:49:24,296 --> 00:49:27,841
Where is Harvey Dent?

651
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:39,394
You know where Harvey is?
You know who he is?

652
00:49:39,561 --> 00:49:40,854
Hands up, pretty boy.

653
00:49:47,986 --> 00:49:50,780
Do you know where I can find Harvey?
I need to talk to him.

654
00:49:50,947 --> 00:49:53,783
Just something little, huh? No.

655
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:58,830
What's going on out there? Wayne!

656
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:03,001
Oh, thank God, you've got a panic room.
Hey, wait...

657
00:50:03,585 --> 00:50:05,378
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

658
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,672
You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.

659
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:11,343
We're not intimidated by thugs.

660
00:50:12,302 --> 00:50:14,012
You know...

661
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:18,642
you remind me of my father.

662
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,936
I hated my father.

663
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:23,146
Okay, stop.

664
00:50:26,983 --> 00:50:29,819
Well, hello, beautiful.

665
00:50:31,988 --> 00:50:35,825
You must be Harvey's squeeze. Hm?

666
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:38,703
And you are beautiful.

667
00:50:45,627 --> 00:50:49,506
You look nervous. Is it the scars?

668
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:52,634
You wanna know how I got them?

669
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:56,388
Come here. Hey.

670
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:58,473
Look at me.

671
00:50:58,932 --> 00:51:03,687
So I had a wife.
She was beautiful, like you...

672
00:51:03,937 --> 00:51:08,149
who tells me I worry too much...

673
00:51:08,316 --> 00:51:11,236
who tells me I ought to smile more...

674
00:51:11,403 --> 00:51:16,908
who gambles and gets in deep
with the sharks. Hey.

675
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:19,744
One day they carve her face.

676
00:51:20,245 --> 00:51:24,499
And we have no money for surgeries.
She can't take it.

677
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:28,378
I just wanna see her smile again. Hm'?

678
00:51:28,712 --> 00:51:31,631
I just want her to know
that I don't care about the scars.

679
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:33,717
So...

680
00:51:34,301 --> 00:51:37,971
I stick a razor in my mouth
and do this...

681
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:39,806
to myself.

682
00:51:40,098 --> 00:51:45,186
And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me.

683
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:46,896
She leaves.

684
00:51:47,606 --> 00:51:50,025
Now I see the funny side.

685
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,485
Now I'm always smiling.

686
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:59,242
You got a little fight in you. I like that.

687
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:00,744
Then you're gonna love me.

688
00:52:28,897 --> 00:52:30,106
Drop the gun.

689
00:52:30,273 --> 00:52:32,911
Oh, sure. You just take
off your little mask

690
00:52:32,923 --> 00:52:35,278
and show us all who
you really are. Hm?

691
00:52:40,909 --> 00:52:42,118
Let her go.

692
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:44,329
Very poor choice of words.

693
00:53:07,143 --> 00:53:09,020
Are you all right?

694
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:13,650
Let's not do that again.

695
00:53:13,942 --> 00:53:16,444
Is Harvey okay?
He's safe.

696
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:19,322
Thank you.

697
00:53:19,614 --> 00:53:20,657
Jim, it's over.

698
00:53:20,824 --> 00:53:23,493
As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.

699
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:26,705
The prosecution's over.
Nobody's standing up in front of a judge...

700
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:30,125
while judges and police commissioners
are getting blown away.

701
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:31,109
What about Dent?

702
00:53:31,121 --> 00:53:33,336
He's got any sense,
Dent's halfway to Mex...

703
00:53:33,503 --> 00:53:35,088
So where do you keep your trash?

704
00:53:36,423 --> 00:53:40,385
You're due in court. I need you alive
long enough to get you on the record.

705
00:53:40,552 --> 00:53:43,596
You can't protect me.
You can't even protect yourselves.

706
00:53:43,763 --> 00:53:47,100
You refuse to cooperate, you're not
coming back here, you go to County.

707
00:53:47,267 --> 00:53:49,728
How long do you calculate
you'll last in there?

708
00:53:51,146 --> 00:53:54,649
Targeting me won't get their money.
I knew the Mob wouldn't go down easily...

709
00:53:54,816 --> 00:53:56,924
but this is different.
They crossed a line.

710
00:53:56,936 --> 00:53:58,319
You crossed the line first.

711
00:53:58,486 --> 00:54:01,906
You squeezed them, you hammered them
to the point of desperation.

712
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:07,078
And in their desperation, they turned to
a man they didn't fully understand.

713
00:54:07,579 --> 00:54:10,123
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.

714
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:12,500
We just need to figure out
what he's after.

715
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:14,107
With respect, Master Wayne...

716
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:17,213
perhaps this is a man
you don't fully understand either.

717
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:20,717
A long time ago, I was in Burma...

718
00:54:20,884 --> 00:54:24,304
and my friends and I were working
for the local government.

719
00:54:24,471 --> 00:54:27,056
They were trying to buy
the loyalty of tribal leaders...

720
00:54:27,223 --> 00:54:30,059
by bribing them with precious stones...

721
00:54:30,226 --> 00:54:34,814
but their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.

722
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:38,276
So we went looking for the stones.

723
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:43,782
But in six months, we never
met anyone who traded with him.

724
00:54:44,407 --> 00:54:48,411
One day, I saw a child
playing with a ruby...

725
00:54:48,578 --> 00:54:51,623
the size of a tangerine.

726
00:54:51,873 --> 00:54:55,251
The bandit had been
throwing them away.

727
00:54:55,919 --> 00:54:58,630
So why steal them?
Because he thought it was good sport.

728
00:54:58,797 --> 00:55:03,760
Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical, like money.

729
00:55:03,927 --> 00:55:08,181
They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned or negotiated with.

730
00:55:08,598 --> 00:55:12,435
Some men just wanna
watch the world burn.

731
00:55:32,872 --> 00:55:34,040
Your name, <i>sir?</i>

732
00:55:34,207 --> 00:55:37,377
<i>Eighth and Orchard.
You'll find Harvey Dent there.</i>

733
00:55:50,265 --> 00:55:51,724
Check the names.

734
00:55:58,314 --> 00:56:00,024
"Richard Dent."

735
00:56:02,235 --> 00:56:03,319
"Patrick Harvey."

736
00:56:03,653 --> 00:56:04,654
Harvey Dent.

737
00:56:04,821 --> 00:56:07,824
I need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.

738
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:10,961
It's because of you
these guys are dead...

739
00:56:10,973 --> 00:56:11,953
Detective!

740
00:56:14,163 --> 00:56:16,207
Give us a minute, guys.

741
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:19,002
That's brick underneath.

742
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:21,326
Gonna take ballistics
off a shattered bullet?

743
00:56:21,338 --> 00:56:22,005
No.

744
00:56:24,257 --> 00:56:26,175
Fingerprints.

745
00:56:34,726 --> 00:56:36,644
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

746
00:56:38,438 --> 00:56:43,151
Because we found his next target.
He's put it in tomorrow's paper.

747
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,754
I'm not sure
you made it loud enough, sir.

748
00:57:15,808 --> 00:57:17,977
What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?

749
00:57:18,144 --> 00:57:21,940
You wanted me to do the diligence
on the LSI Holdings deal again.

750
00:57:22,607 --> 00:57:24,901
Well, I found some irregularities.

751
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:27,403
Their CEO is in police custody.

752
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:30,490
No, not with their numbers, with yours.

753
00:57:30,698 --> 00:57:35,620
Applied Sciences. Whole division of Wayne
Enterprises just disappeared overnight.

754
00:57:35,787 --> 00:57:40,041
I went down to the archives
and I started pulling some old files.

755
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:44,158
Don't tell me you didn't
recognize your baby

756
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:46,839
pancaking cop cars
on the evening news.

757
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:50,343
Now you got the entire R & D Department
burning through cash...

758
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:53,846
claiming it's related to
cell phones for the Army?

759
00:57:54,013 --> 00:57:57,100
What are you building for him now,
a rocket ship?

760
00:57:58,977 --> 00:58:00,728
I want...

761
00:58:00,895 --> 00:58:04,816
$10 million a year
for the rest of my life.

762
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:09,445
Let me get this straight.

763
00:58:10,655 --> 00:58:13,116
You think that your client...

764
00:58:13,282 --> 00:58:18,121
one of the wealthiest, most powerful men
in the world, is secretly a vigilante...

765
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:22,959
who spends his nights beating criminals
to a pulp with his bare hands...

766
00:58:23,126 --> 00:58:26,295
and your plan
is to blackmail this person?

767
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:35,054
Good luck.

768
00:58:37,932 --> 00:58:39,350
When...

769
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:42,228
Keep that.

770
00:58:48,901 --> 00:58:51,362
This is your original scan.

771
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,074
Here it is reengineered.

772
00:59:03,291 --> 00:59:06,836
And there's the thumbprint he left
when he pushed the round in the clip.

773
00:59:08,838 --> 00:59:10,006
<i>I'll</i> get you a copy.

774
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:14,010
Mr. Wayne, did you reassign R & D?

775
00:59:14,177 --> 00:59:16,679
Yeah. Government
telecommunications project.

776
00:59:16,846 --> 00:59:18,890
Wasn't aware
we had any government contracts.

777
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:22,143
You know, Lucius, I'm playing this one
pretty close to the chest.

778
00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:24,979
Fair enough.

779
00:59:27,899 --> 00:59:31,027
With no word from the Batman,
even as they mourn Commissioner Loeb...

780
00:59:31,194 --> 00:59:34,572
these cops have to wonder if
the Joker will make good on his threat...

781
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:37,950
in the obituary column of
The Gotham <i>Times</i> to kill the mayor.

782
00:59:39,744 --> 00:59:43,414
I've checked all the databases.
There are four possibles.

783
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:45,708
Cross-reference the addresses.

784
00:59:45,875 --> 00:59:49,879
Look for Parkside,
overlooking the parade.

785
00:59:51,089 --> 00:59:52,215
I got one.

786
00:59:52,381 --> 00:59:56,385
Melvin White,
1502 Randolph Apartments.

787
00:59:56,761 --> 01:00:00,848
Aggravated assault,
moved to Arkham twice.

788
01:00:39,929 --> 01:00:41,514
What do you got on the roof?

789
01:00:41,681 --> 01:00:45,226
We're tight, but frankly,
there's a lot of windows up here.

790
01:00:53,776 --> 01:00:57,822
Commissioner Loeb dedicated his life
to law enforcement...

791
01:00:57,989 --> 01:01:00,283
and to the protection
of his community.

792
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:02,243
I remember when I first took office...

793
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:04,954
and I asked if he wanted
to stay on as commissioner.

794
01:01:05,121 --> 01:01:10,376
And he said he would, provided
I kept my politics out of his office.

795
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:17,300
Clearly he was not a man who minced
words, nor should he have been.

796
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:21,971
A number of policies that he enacted
as commissioner were unpopular.

797
01:01:22,138 --> 01:01:25,391
Policies that flooded my office
with angry calls and letters...

798
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:31,439
Who's that?
What happened?

799
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:34,358
They took our guns.

800
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:36,319
And our uniforms.

801
01:01:42,909 --> 01:01:45,661
And as we recognize the sacrifice
of this man...

802
01:01:45,828 --> 01:01:49,790
we must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety.

803
01:01:49,957 --> 01:01:52,460
Stand by. Honor guard.

804
01:01:52,627 --> 01:01:56,255
Attention. Port arms.

805
01:01:57,465 --> 01:02:01,844
Ready! Aim! Fire!

806
01:02:02,637 --> 01:02:04,180
Ready! Aim!

807
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:10,186
Ready! Aim!

808
01:02:18,611 --> 01:02:20,029
Stay down! Don't move!

809
01:02:21,864 --> 01:02:23,532
Mr. Mayor. Get him out of here.

810
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:35,002
<i>I'll</i> see you later.
Why are you going back?

811
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,683
Get out of here.

812
01:02:52,728 --> 01:02:54,480
Tell me what you know about the Joker.

813
01:03:25,511 --> 01:03:26,846
No.

814
01:03:27,263 --> 01:03:28,597
I'm sorry, Barbara.

815
01:03:29,515 --> 01:03:32,768
Jimmy, go play with your sister.
Go ahead, honey.

816
01:03:32,935 --> 01:03:37,106
If there's anything we can do,
anything you need, we're here for you.

817
01:03:38,691 --> 01:03:40,609
Shh.

818
01:03:40,776 --> 01:03:42,028
Are you out there?

819
01:03:43,362 --> 01:03:47,867
Are you? You brought this
craziness on us. You did!

820
01:03:48,034 --> 01:03:50,411
You brought this on us!

821
01:03:51,454 --> 01:03:56,042
Switch it off, he ain't coming.
He doesn't wanna talk to us.

822
01:03:56,459 --> 01:03:59,462
God help whoever he does wanna talk to.

823
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:04,050
Can't we go someplace quieter?
We can't hear each other talk.

824
01:04:04,216 --> 01:04:07,053
What makes you think
I wanna hear you talk?

825
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:08,262
What?

826
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:39,293
Yeah?
Second.

827
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:40,503
Okay.

828
01:04:40,669 --> 01:04:42,838
Harvey, where are you?
Where are <i>you?</i>

829
01:04:43,005 --> 01:04:46,842
I'm where you should be, at Major Crimes.
I'm trying to deal with all of this mess.

830
01:04:47,009 --> 01:04:50,596
Can I <i>get the fingerprint analysis?
Rachel, listen. You're not safe there.</i>

831
01:04:50,763 --> 01:04:52,556
This is Gordon's unit.
Gordon's gone.

832
01:04:52,723 --> 01:04:56,310
He vouched for these men.
And he's gone.

833
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:03,025
<i>The Joker's named you next.</i>

834
01:05:03,192 --> 01:05:06,195
<i>God, is there someone, is there anyone
in this town we can trust?</i>

835
01:05:06,362 --> 01:05:08,072
Bruce.

836
01:05:08,364 --> 01:05:09,532
We can trust Bruce Wayne.

837
01:05:09,698 --> 01:05:13,285
<i>No. Rachel, I know you're his
friend, but... Harvey, trust me.</i>

838
01:05:13,452 --> 01:05:16,205
Bruce's penthouse is now
the safest place in the city.

839
01:05:16,372 --> 01:05:17,706
<i>Then you go straight there.</i>

840
01:05:17,873 --> 01:05:20,000
<i>Don't tell anybody
and I'll find you there.</i>

841
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:21,877
I love you.

842
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:37,143
I want the Joker.

843
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:40,020
From one professional to another...

844
01:05:40,187 --> 01:05:42,731
you're trying to scare somebody,
pick a better spot.

845
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:45,484
From this height,
the fall wouldn't kill me.

846
01:05:45,651 --> 01:05:47,236
I'm counting on it.
Huh!

847
01:05:54,618 --> 01:05:57,746
Where is he?
I don't know where he is. He found us.

848
01:05:57,913 --> 01:05:59,206
He must have friends.

849
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:01,834
Friends? Have you met this guy?

850
01:06:02,001 --> 01:06:03,586
Someone knows where he is.

851
01:06:03,752 --> 01:06:06,255
Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.

852
01:06:06,422 --> 01:06:07,756
They're wise to your act.

853
01:06:07,923 --> 01:06:11,927
You got rules.
The Joker, he's got no rules.

854
01:06:12,094 --> 01:06:16,974
Nobody's gonna cross him for you.
If you want this guy, you got one way.

855
01:06:17,141 --> 01:06:18,934
But you already know what that is.

856
01:06:19,101 --> 01:06:21,896
Just take off that mask,
let him come find you.

857
01:06:23,522 --> 01:06:27,610
Or you can let a couple more people
get killed while you make up your mind.

858
01:06:29,278 --> 01:06:31,280
You wanna play games?

859
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:38,621
How's that feel?

860
01:06:38,787 --> 01:06:41,415
You wouldn't.
I wouldn't!

861
01:06:42,917 --> 01:06:44,543
You don't think I will?
Mm-mm.

862
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:46,754
You don't think I will?
Mm-mm.

863
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:51,342
No. No, I wouldn't.

864
01:06:52,551 --> 01:06:55,095
That's why I'm not
gonna leave it up to me.

865
01:06:56,096 --> 01:06:59,099
Heads, you get to keep your head.

866
01:06:59,517 --> 01:07:01,143
Tails...

867
01:07:02,102 --> 01:07:03,145
not so lucky.

868
01:07:03,521 --> 01:07:07,066
So you wanna tell me about the Joker?

869
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:20,162
Let's go again.
I don't know anything! God, don't!

870
01:07:20,329 --> 01:07:22,706
You're not playing the odds, friend.

871
01:07:23,832 --> 01:07:25,834
Let's do it again.

872
01:07:28,671 --> 01:07:30,506
You'd leave a man's life to chance?

873
01:07:31,257 --> 01:07:34,843
Not exactly.
His name's Schiff, Thomas.

874
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:38,013
He's a paranoid schizophrenic,
former patient at Arkham.

875
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:42,810
The kind of mind the Joker attracts.
What do you expect to learn from him?

876
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:48,941
The Joker killed Gordon.
He's gonna kill Rachel.

877
01:07:49,108 --> 01:07:51,902
You're the symbol of hope
I could never be.

878
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:53,904
Your stand against organized crime...

879
01:07:54,071 --> 01:07:57,283
is the first legitimate ray of light
in Gotham in decades.

880
01:07:57,449 --> 01:08:01,078
If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone.

881
01:08:01,245 --> 01:08:03,539
The criminals you arrested
would be released...

882
01:08:03,706 --> 01:08:06,792
and Jim Gordon
will have died for nothing.

883
01:08:07,418 --> 01:08:09,670
You're gonna hold
a press conference tomorrow.

884
01:08:09,837 --> 01:08:12,214
Why?
No one else will die because of me.

885
01:08:12,381 --> 01:08:14,717
Gotham's in your hands now.

886
01:08:14,883 --> 01:08:16,594
You can't.

887
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,137
You can't give in.

888
01:08:18,429 --> 01:08:20,973
You can't give in!

889
01:08:36,322 --> 01:08:37,573
Harvey called.

890
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:40,784
He said Batman's gonna turn himself in.

891
01:08:40,951 --> 01:08:42,077
I have no choice.

892
01:08:42,244 --> 01:08:45,331
You honestly think that's gonna
keep the Joker from killing people?

893
01:08:45,497 --> 01:08:48,959
Maybe not. But I have enough blood
on my hands.

894
01:08:49,418 --> 01:08:54,256
And I've seen now what I would
have to become to stop men like him.

895
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:58,260
You once told me that
if the day came when I was finished...

896
01:08:58,427 --> 01:09:00,512
that we'd be together.

897
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:04,391
Bruce, don't make me
your one hope for a normal life.

898
01:09:05,934 --> 01:09:07,269
Did you mean it?

899
01:09:08,771 --> 01:09:10,606
Yes.

900
01:09:27,873 --> 01:09:29,667
Bruce.

901
01:09:30,626 --> 01:09:34,546
If you turn yourself in,
they're not gonna let us be together.

902
01:09:45,182 --> 01:09:48,143
Logs as well?
Everything.

903
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:51,689
Anything that could lead back
to Lucius or Rachel.

904
01:09:57,027 --> 01:10:00,322
People are dying, Alfred.
What would you have me do?

905
01:10:00,489 --> 01:10:04,243
Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.

906
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:08,122
They'll hate you for it,
but that's the point of Batman.

907
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:13,836
He can be the outcast. He can make
the choice that no one else can make.

908
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:15,337
The right choice.

909
01:10:15,838 --> 01:10:18,882
No, today I found out
what Batman can't do.

910
01:10:19,049 --> 01:10:20,300
He can't endure this.

911
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:23,470
Today you get to say "I told you so."

912
01:10:24,054 --> 01:10:27,224
Today, I don't want to.

913
01:10:33,063 --> 01:10:34,523
But <i>I</i> did bloody tell you.

914
01:10:37,568 --> 01:10:40,571
I suppose they're gonna
lock me up as well...

915
01:10:41,363 --> 01:10:42,614
as your accomplice.

916
01:10:42,781 --> 01:10:47,536
Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them
the whole thing was your idea.

917
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:55,335
Ladies and gentlemen, I've called
this press conference for two reasons.

918
01:10:55,502 --> 01:10:57,546
Firstly, to assure the citizens
of Gotham...

919
01:10:57,713 --> 01:11:01,383
that everything that can be done
over the Joker killings is being done.

920
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,846
Secondly, because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in.

921
01:11:06,013 --> 01:11:07,723
<i>But let's consider the situation.</i>

922
01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:10,726
Should we give in
to this terrorist's demands?

923
01:11:10,893 --> 01:11:12,352
Do we really think he's gonna...?

924
01:11:12,519 --> 01:11:15,898
You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante
than the lives of citizens?

925
01:11:16,064 --> 01:11:18,442
The Batman is an outlaw.

926
01:11:19,318 --> 01:11:23,071
That's not why we demand he turn himself
in, we're doing it because we're scared.

927
01:11:23,238 --> 01:11:26,033
We've been happy to let Batman
clean up our streets till now.

928
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:29,161
Things are worse than ever!
Amen.

929
01:11:30,496 --> 01:11:32,414
Yes, they are.

930
01:11:34,917 --> 01:11:37,920
But the night is darkest
just before the dawn.

931
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:42,466
And I promise you...

932
01:11:43,258 --> 01:11:44,676
the dawn is coming.

933
01:11:44,843 --> 01:11:49,389
One day, the Batman will have to answer
for the laws he's broken. But to us...

934
01:11:49,556 --> 01:11:51,308
not to this madman.

935
01:11:51,475 --> 01:11:53,811
No more dead cops!
Yeah!

936
01:11:57,105 --> 01:11:58,690
He should turn himself in!

937
01:11:58,857 --> 01:12:01,568
Give us the Batman! Come on!
Where is he?

938
01:12:04,446 --> 01:12:06,615
So be it. Take the Batman into custody.

939
01:12:07,074 --> 01:12:09,034
What?
Is he here?

940
01:12:09,785 --> 01:12:10,786
I am the Batman.

941
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:14,122
What?
Come on.

942
01:12:22,506 --> 01:12:24,424
Alfred.

943
01:12:25,759 --> 01:12:27,553
Why is he letting Harvey do this?

944
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:30,722
He went down to the press conference.
I know. He just stood by.

945
01:12:30,889 --> 01:12:32,975
Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent...

946
01:12:33,141 --> 01:12:36,144
believe that Batman stands for
something more important...

947
01:12:36,311 --> 01:12:38,647
than the whims of a terrorist,
Miss Dawes...

948
01:12:38,814 --> 01:12:40,816
even if everyone hates him for it.

949
01:12:40,983 --> 01:12:43,110
That's the sacrifice he's making.

950
01:12:43,277 --> 01:12:46,905
He's not being a hero.
He's being something more.

951
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:49,074
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

952
01:12:49,241 --> 01:12:52,327
Letting Harvey take the fall for this
is not heroic at all.

953
01:12:54,997 --> 01:12:56,623
You know him better than anyone.

954
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,083
I do.

955
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:04,506
Will you give this to him for me?
When the time is right?

956
01:13:05,966 --> 01:13:07,175
How will I know?

957
01:13:07,342 --> 01:13:08,844
It's not sealed.

958
01:13:10,262 --> 01:13:11,805
Goodbye, Alfred.

959
01:13:15,976 --> 01:13:17,728
Bye, Rachel.

960
01:13:25,611 --> 01:13:27,487
I didn't have time to talk this through.

961
01:13:27,654 --> 01:13:28,711
What are you doing?

962
01:13:28,723 --> 01:13:31,116
They're transferring
me to Central Holding.

963
01:13:31,408 --> 01:13:35,078
This is the Joker's chance, and when he
attacks, the Batman will take him down.

964
01:13:35,245 --> 01:13:36,788
Listen. This is too dangerous.

965
01:13:36,955 --> 01:13:40,667
We get this guy to County, he's their
problem. The streets will be cleared...

966
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:44,546
so let's go.
The convoys stop for no reason.

967
01:13:44,713 --> 01:13:46,173
I hope you got some moves, pal.

968
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:50,510
He's using you as bait. He doesn't know if
he can get the Joker. He's failed so far.

969
01:13:50,844 --> 01:13:52,620
How do you know
what he's thinking?

970
01:13:52,632 --> 01:13:54,890
I just do. Anyway, this
isn't just about you.

971
01:13:55,057 --> 01:13:57,434
What about the people
depending on you to

972
01:13:57,446 --> 01:14:00,062
clean the city up and
do it honorably and...?

973
01:14:05,734 --> 01:14:08,362
Harvey. Tell everyone the truth.

974
01:14:08,737 --> 01:14:10,614
Heads, I go through with it.

975
01:14:10,822 --> 01:14:14,743
This is your life. You can't
leave something like that to chance.

976
01:14:15,118 --> 01:14:16,244
I'm not.

977
01:14:19,623 --> 01:14:22,042
You make your own luck.

978
01:14:43,855 --> 01:14:45,857
Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal.

979
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:55,826
What the hell is that?

980
01:14:55,993 --> 01:14:58,203
Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!

981
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:01,581
Damn it! All units divert down
onto Lower Fifth. I repeat, exit down.

982
01:15:01,999 --> 01:15:03,125
<i>Exit down!</i>

983
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:05,627
Lower Fifth? We'll be
like turkeys on Thanksgiving.

984
01:15:38,326 --> 01:15:40,662
Jesus. Come on, get us out of here.
Let's go.

985
01:15:42,831 --> 01:15:45,208
Listen, we need backup.
We've got company.

986
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:46,918
We got trouble, guys.

987
01:15:49,838 --> 01:15:50,922
Lock and load!

988
01:16:02,142 --> 01:16:03,518
The hell was that?

989
01:16:25,373 --> 01:16:28,043
These are built for that, right?
He'll need something...

990
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:30,003
a lot bigger to get through this.

991
01:16:31,046 --> 01:16:32,506
What is that?

992
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,175
What is that, a bazooka?

993
01:16:43,809 --> 01:16:45,519
I didn't sign up for this!

994
01:17:01,868 --> 01:17:03,203
Look out.

995
01:17:03,995 --> 01:17:05,163
Look out!

996
01:17:13,463 --> 01:17:14,506
Hmm.

997
01:17:27,435 --> 01:17:28,562
Come on, let's go!

998
01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:17,360
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent.

999
01:18:17,527 --> 01:18:20,363
Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive.

1000
01:18:25,285 --> 01:18:28,872
<i>Scanning all systems.
Scanning all systems.</i>

1001
01:18:36,338 --> 01:18:38,465
We gotta get topside.
We need air support, now!

1002
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:45,847
I like this job. I like it.

1003
01:18:48,099 --> 01:18:50,727
<i>Damage catastrophic.
Eject sequence initiated.</i>

1004
01:19:04,699 --> 01:19:06,201
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1005
01:19:15,293 --> 01:19:18,505
We're on point, ready to give them
some of their own medicine.

1006
01:19:24,886 --> 01:19:27,347
That's what I'm talking about. Air cav.

1007
01:19:40,902 --> 01:19:42,612
Okay, rack them up.

1008
01:19:42,779 --> 01:19:45,156
<i>Rack them up, rack them up,
rack them up.</i>

1009
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:12,058
That's not good.

1010
01:20:15,562 --> 01:20:16,771
Okay, that's not good!

1011
01:20:59,898 --> 01:21:01,983
Now, there's a Batman.

1012
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:07,489
Ooh, you wanna play. Come on.

1013
01:21:10,408 --> 01:21:11,534
Come on.

1014
01:21:20,668 --> 01:21:21,920
He missed!

1015
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:38,269
You can't stop here.
We're like sitting ducks!

1016
01:21:55,286 --> 01:21:56,371
Come on, come on.

1017
01:21:59,499 --> 01:22:02,877
Come on. Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on!

1018
01:22:05,422 --> 01:22:06,881
Come on.

1019
01:22:07,549 --> 01:22:10,885
Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on, hit me.

1020
01:22:11,052 --> 01:22:12,679
Come on, hit me. Come on, hit me!

1021
01:22:14,806 --> 01:22:15,849
Hit me!

1022
01:22:40,832 --> 01:22:44,085
Come on, come on. Aah!

1023
01:22:44,252 --> 01:22:46,504
Could you please just give me a minute?

1024
01:22:48,590 --> 01:22:50,425
We got you, you son of a bitch.

1025
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:57,640
Gor... You do like to play things
pretty close to the chest.

1026
01:22:58,099 --> 01:22:59,809
We got him, Harvey.

1027
01:22:59,976 --> 01:23:03,438
Mr. Dent! How does it feel
to be the biggest hero in Gotham?

1028
01:23:03,605 --> 01:23:06,900
No, I'm no hero.
Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.

1029
01:23:07,066 --> 01:23:10,236
But you and your office have
been working with the Batman all along.

1030
01:23:10,403 --> 01:23:12,518
No, but I trusted him
to do the right thing.

1031
01:23:12,530 --> 01:23:13,239
Which was?

1032
01:23:13,406 --> 01:23:14,449
Saving my ass.

1033
01:23:14,616 --> 01:23:17,535
All right, people, that's enough.
Let him be. Let him be.

1034
01:23:17,702 --> 01:23:19,621
Thank you, detective.

1035
01:23:19,829 --> 01:23:21,956
I've got a date
with a pretty upset girlfriend.

1036
01:23:22,123 --> 01:23:24,501
I figured, counselor.
Mr. Dent, sir...

1037
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:28,796
how about one for the front page, sir?
Mr. Dent.

1038
01:23:40,141 --> 01:23:43,311
Stand away! All of you!

1039
01:23:43,478 --> 01:23:46,981
I don't want anything for his Mob lawyer
to use, you understand?

1040
01:23:49,234 --> 01:23:51,110
Back from the dead.

1041
01:23:51,778 --> 01:23:53,321
I, uh...

1042
01:23:53,488 --> 01:23:55,406
couldn't risk my family's safety.

1043
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:58,535
What do we got?

1044
01:24:00,203 --> 01:24:04,165
Nothing. No matches on prints,
DNA, dental.

1045
01:24:04,332 --> 01:24:07,085
Clothing is custom, no labels.

1046
01:24:07,293 --> 01:24:09,420
Nothing in his pockets
but knives and lint.

1047
01:24:09,587 --> 01:24:11,506
No name.

1048
01:24:11,839 --> 01:24:13,800
No other alias.
Go home, Gordon.

1049
01:24:13,967 --> 01:24:17,053
The clown'll keep till morning.
Go get some rest.

1050
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:19,055
You're gonna need it.

1051
01:24:19,305 --> 01:24:21,891
Tomorrow you take the big job.

1052
01:24:22,559 --> 01:24:25,728
You don't have any say in the matter.
Commissioner Gordon.

1053
01:24:41,578 --> 01:24:43,705
I'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety.

1054
01:24:50,211 --> 01:24:51,629
Look at these ugly bastards.

1055
01:24:51,796 --> 01:24:53,716
I don't feel good.
You're a cop killer.

1056
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:56,175
You're lucky to be feeling anything
below the neck.

1057
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:57,927
Please!
Step away from the bars!

1058
01:24:58,094 --> 01:25:00,263
My insides hurt.

1059
01:25:14,444 --> 01:25:16,237
Did Batman save you, Daddy?

1060
01:25:18,406 --> 01:25:20,700
Actually, this time...

1061
01:25:20,867 --> 01:25:23,036
I saved him.

1062
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:36,007
Has he said anything yet?

1063
01:25:43,598 --> 01:25:47,810
Evening, commissioner.

1064
01:25:55,443 --> 01:25:57,654
Harvey Dent never made it home.

1065
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:59,947
Of course not.
What have you done with him?

1066
01:26:00,865 --> 01:26:02,617
Me?

1067
01:26:04,243 --> 01:26:06,371
I was right here.

1068
01:26:07,789 --> 01:26:09,624
Who did you leave him with?

1069
01:26:09,791 --> 01:26:12,627
Hm? Your people?

1070
01:26:13,753 --> 01:26:17,090
Assuming, of course,
that they are still your people...

1071
01:26:17,256 --> 01:26:19,967
and not Maroni's.

1072
01:26:22,178 --> 01:26:24,555
Does it depress you, commissioner...

1073
01:26:24,972 --> 01:26:29,936
to know just how alone you really are?

1074
01:26:31,938 --> 01:26:36,818
Does it make you feel responsible
for Harvey Dent's current predicament?

1075
01:26:36,984 --> 01:26:39,654
Where is he?
What's the time?

1076
01:26:40,154 --> 01:26:41,656
What difference does that make?

1077
01:26:41,906 --> 01:26:47,370
Well, depending on the time,
he may be in one spot or several.

1078
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:56,713
If we're gonna play games...
Mm-hm?

1079
01:26:59,882 --> 01:27:01,843
I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.

1080
01:27:02,009 --> 01:27:06,097
Ah, the "good cop, bad cop" routine?

1081
01:27:06,764 --> 01:27:07,807
Not exactly.

1082
01:27:18,317 --> 01:27:22,363
Never start with the head. The victim
gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next...

1083
01:27:25,533 --> 01:27:26,659
See?

1084
01:27:26,826 --> 01:27:29,162
You wanted me. Here I am.

1085
01:27:30,204 --> 01:27:32,331
<i>I wanted</i> to see what you'd do.

1086
01:27:32,874 --> 01:27:35,460
And you didn't disappoint.

1087
01:27:35,626 --> 01:27:38,463
You let five people die.

1088
01:27:39,422 --> 01:27:43,092
Then you let Dent take your place.

1089
01:27:43,259 --> 01:27:45,887
Even to a guy like me, that's cold.
Where's Dent?

1090
01:27:46,053 --> 01:27:50,850
Those Mob fools want you gone so
they can get back to the way things were.

1091
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:56,105
But I know the truth. There's no
going back. You've changed things.

1092
01:27:56,272 --> 01:27:58,691
Forever.
Then why do you wanna kill me?

1093
01:28:01,652 --> 01:28:03,070
I don't wanna kill you.

1094
01:28:03,571 --> 01:28:08,117
What would I do without you?
Go back to ripping off Mob dealers? No, no.

1095
01:28:08,284 --> 01:28:10,661
No. No, you...

1096
01:28:10,828 --> 01:28:13,247
You complete me.

1097
01:28:13,414 --> 01:28:17,752
You're garbage who kills for money.
Don't talk like one of them. You're not.

1098
01:28:17,919 --> 01:28:20,338
Even if you'd like to be.

1099
01:28:21,589 --> 01:28:23,424
To them, you're just a freak...

1100
01:28:24,342 --> 01:28:25,676
like me.

1101
01:28:25,843 --> 01:28:28,137
They need you right now...

1102
01:28:28,721 --> 01:28:30,765
but when they don't...

1103
01:28:31,307 --> 01:28:34,352
they'll cast you out like a leper.

1104
01:28:34,519 --> 01:28:38,439
You see, their morals, their code...

1105
01:28:38,689 --> 01:28:40,858
it's a bad joke.

1106
01:28:41,108 --> 01:28:44,445
Dropped at the first sign of trouble.

1107
01:28:45,112 --> 01:28:49,116
They're only as good as the world
allows them to be. I'll show you.

1108
01:28:49,283 --> 01:28:52,453
When the chips are down, these...

1109
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:54,872
These civilized people...

1110
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:57,124
they'll eat each other.

1111
01:28:57,834 --> 01:29:00,211
See, I'm not a monster.

1112
01:29:01,587 --> 01:29:02,880
I'm just ahead of the curve.

1113
01:29:05,132 --> 01:29:06,217
Where's Dent?

1114
01:29:06,384 --> 01:29:09,303
You have all these rules,
and you think they'll save you.

1115
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:14,809
He's in control.
I have one rule.

1116
01:29:14,976 --> 01:29:18,062
Oh. Then that's the rule you'll
have to break to know the truth.

1117
01:29:18,229 --> 01:29:19,397
Which is?

1118
01:29:19,564 --> 01:29:21,983
The only sensible way to live
is without rules.

1119
01:29:22,149 --> 01:29:24,819
And tonight you're gonna break
your one rule.

1120
01:29:24,986 --> 01:29:26,028
I'm considering it.

1121
01:29:26,195 --> 01:29:28,823
There's only minutes left,
so you'll have to play my game...

1122
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:31,576
if you wanna save one of them.

1123
01:29:32,076 --> 01:29:33,119
"Them"?

1124
01:29:33,286 --> 01:29:37,331
You know, for a while there,
I thought you really were Dent.

1125
01:29:37,498 --> 01:29:40,126
The way you threw yourself after her.

1126
01:29:46,424 --> 01:29:47,508
Look at you go.

1127
01:29:53,139 --> 01:29:56,726
Does Harvey know
about you and his little bunny?

1128
01:29:57,643 --> 01:29:59,020
Where are they?!

1129
01:29:59,186 --> 01:30:01,188
Killing is making a choice.

1130
01:30:01,355 --> 01:30:04,442
Where are they?!
Choose between one life or the other.

1131
01:30:05,192 --> 01:30:09,447
Your friend the district attorney,
or his blushing bride-to-be.

1132
01:30:14,619 --> 01:30:18,706
You have nothing,
nothing to threaten me with.

1133
01:30:19,123 --> 01:30:22,627
Nothing to do with all your strength.

1134
01:30:22,835 --> 01:30:26,255
Don't worry, I'm gonna tell you
where they are, both of them.

1135
01:30:26,422 --> 01:30:29,467
And that's the point.
You'll have to choose.

1136
01:30:30,217 --> 01:30:33,054
He's at 25052nd Street...

1137
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:36,557
and she's on Avenue X at Cicero.

1138
01:30:38,643 --> 01:30:40,394
Which one you going after?
Rachel.

1139
01:30:41,812 --> 01:30:43,230
We're getting Dent!

1140
01:30:45,483 --> 01:30:48,361
25052nd Street!

1141
01:30:51,238 --> 01:30:53,074
<i>Hello?</i>

1142
01:30:54,033 --> 01:30:56,410
<i>Can anybody hear me?</i>

1143
01:30:58,829 --> 01:31:01,457
<i>Hello!</i>

1144
01:31:05,461 --> 01:31:07,713
Rachel?
Harvey.

1145
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:10,091
Oh, Harvey, thank God. Are you okay?

1146
01:31:10,257 --> 01:31:11,842
I'm all right. I'm in a...

1147
01:31:12,009 --> 01:31:15,596
I'm in a warehouse.
They got me wired to these oil drums.

1148
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:17,848
I am too.

1149
01:31:18,391 --> 01:31:20,101
<i>Harvey.</i>

1150
01:31:27,358 --> 01:31:29,819
I want my phone call.

1151
01:31:29,986 --> 01:31:32,780
I want it. I want it. I want my phone call.

1152
01:31:33,447 --> 01:31:35,282
That's nice.

1153
01:31:36,784 --> 01:31:41,622
How many of your friends have I killed?

1154
01:31:45,376 --> 01:31:46,460
I'm a 20-year man...

1155
01:31:46,627 --> 01:31:50,089
and I know the difference between
punks who need a lesson in manners...

1156
01:31:50,256 --> 01:31:53,134
and the freaks like you
who would just enjoy it.

1157
01:31:54,010 --> 01:31:56,470
And you killed six of my friends.

1158
01:31:56,637 --> 01:31:57,638
<i>Six?</i>

1159
01:31:57,805 --> 01:32:00,307
Please. My insides hurt.

1160
01:32:00,474 --> 01:32:02,226
I don't really care. Back away.

1161
01:32:02,393 --> 01:32:05,563
The boss said he'd make the voices
go away.

1162
01:32:05,730 --> 01:32:09,275
He said he'd go inside
and replace them with bright lights...

1163
01:32:09,442 --> 01:32:10,568
like Christmas.

1164
01:32:10,735 --> 01:32:13,279
You're out of your mind, pal. Back off.

1165
01:32:13,446 --> 01:32:16,282
Medic to the holding tank.
Come on. Get the door open.

1166
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:17,658
You guys, back off!

1167
01:32:17,825 --> 01:32:19,994
Listen, we don't have a lot of time.

1168
01:32:20,161 --> 01:32:24,165
They told me that only one of us
was gonna make it...

1169
01:32:24,331 --> 01:32:27,668
and that they were gonna
let our friends choose.

1170
01:32:30,379 --> 01:32:32,506
Okay, Rachel.

1171
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:36,218
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be
all right. They're coming for you.

1172
01:32:36,385 --> 01:32:40,681
Listen to me. I'll help you. Just talk me
through what's going on with you.

1173
01:32:40,848 --> 01:32:44,351
<i>Can you find something, anything, sharp?
I'm trying.</i>

1174
01:32:44,518 --> 01:32:46,687
What's...?
Shit.

1175
01:32:46,854 --> 01:32:48,355
Harvey?

1176
01:32:52,109 --> 01:32:53,778
Harvey, what's happening?

1177
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:06,957
All available units,
converge at 25052nd Street.

1178
01:33:07,291 --> 01:33:11,378
Do you wanna know why I use a knife?

1179
01:33:13,672 --> 01:33:15,007
Guns are too quick.

1180
01:33:15,174 --> 01:33:18,552
You can't savor all the...

1181
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:22,056
little emotions.

1182
01:33:23,974 --> 01:33:28,854
You see, in their last moments...

1183
01:33:29,021 --> 01:33:31,315
people show you who they really are.

1184
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:38,072
So in a way, I knew your friends
better than you ever did.

1185
01:33:41,826 --> 01:33:45,246
Would you like to know
which of them were cowards?

1186
01:33:51,752 --> 01:33:53,420
What's that?
Jeez.

1187
01:33:53,629 --> 01:33:55,673
He's got some kind of a...

1188
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:59,051
contusion.
I know you're gonna enjoy this.

1189
01:34:00,427 --> 01:34:04,181
I'm gonna have to try and enjoy it
even more.

1190
01:34:09,395 --> 01:34:10,688
Whoa, whoa!

1191
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:12,811
Just put it down.

1192
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:15,734
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Drop the weapon now!

1193
01:34:15,901 --> 01:34:19,864
It's my own damn fault, just shoot him!
Let him go now! Drop it!

1194
01:34:20,156 --> 01:34:23,159
What? Sorry?
What do you want?

1195
01:34:24,201 --> 01:34:26,120
I just want my phone call.

1196
01:34:29,123 --> 01:34:31,792
<i>What...? What...? What's happening?</i>

1197
01:34:31,959 --> 01:34:34,795
<i>Just talk to me, just for one second.</i>

1198
01:34:37,131 --> 01:34:39,800
All right?
Right.

1199
01:34:41,719 --> 01:34:43,137
Ow.

1200
01:34:44,054 --> 01:34:45,639
Ow.
Shh, shh, shh.

1201
01:34:51,604 --> 01:34:53,647
Is that a phone?

1202
01:35:03,324 --> 01:35:04,658
Mount the curb!

1203
01:35:12,666 --> 01:35:16,670
Harvey, just in case,
I wanna tell you something, okay?

1204
01:35:16,837 --> 01:35:18,631
<i>Don't think like that. They're coming.</i>

1205
01:35:18,797 --> 01:35:21,091
I know they are,
but I don't want them to.

1206
01:35:25,512 --> 01:35:29,600
I don't wanna live without you,
and I do have an answer for you.

1207
01:35:30,017 --> 01:35:31,769
My answer is yes.

1208
01:35:34,521 --> 01:35:37,274
No! No! No!

1209
01:35:37,441 --> 01:35:40,069
<i>Not me! Why are you coming for me?</i>

1210
01:35:40,236 --> 01:35:41,278
<i>No!</i>

1211
01:35:42,947 --> 01:35:44,531
Rachel! Rachel!

1212
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:47,076
<i>Harvey.
No! No! Rachel!</i>

1213
01:35:47,243 --> 01:35:48,285
Okay.

1214
01:35:48,452 --> 01:35:49,536
Rachel!

1215
01:35:49,954 --> 01:35:51,497
<i>No! No!</i>

1216
01:35:51,664 --> 01:35:55,793
Harvey, it's okay. It's all right. Listen.

1217
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:57,294
Somewh...

1218
01:36:03,175 --> 01:36:04,385
No, commissioner!

1219
01:36:04,551 --> 01:36:07,221
Rachel! No!

1220
01:36:21,568 --> 01:36:22,695
Hello there.

1221
01:36:28,575 --> 01:36:32,079
Back at the MCU, the Joker's gone.

1222
01:36:32,997 --> 01:36:34,707
With Lau?

1223
01:36:37,501 --> 01:36:40,087
The Joker planned to be caught.

1224
01:36:40,421 --> 01:36:42,589
He wanted me to lock him up
in the MCU.

1225
01:37:06,030 --> 01:37:08,574
<i>I need to be honest and clear.</i>

1226
01:37:10,617 --> 01:37:13,162
<i>I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.</i>

1227
01:37:13,329 --> 01:37:17,249
<i>I love him, and I wanna spend
the rest of my life with him.</i>

1228
01:37:17,791 --> 01:37:22,212
<i>When I told you that if Gotham no longer
needed Batman, we could be together...</i>

1229
01:37:22,379 --> 01:37:24,590
<i>I meant it.</i>

1230
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:29,595
<i>But now I'm sure the day won't come
when you no longer need Batman.</i>

1231
01:37:30,637 --> 01:37:32,556
<i>I hope it does.</i>

1232
01:37:32,723 --> 01:37:35,476
<i>And if it does, I will be there...</i>

1233
01:37:36,018 --> 01:37:37,436
<i>but as your friend.</i>

1234
01:37:38,145 --> 01:37:40,397
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1235
01:37:40,564 --> 01:37:42,941
<i>I'm sorry to let you down.</i>

1236
01:37:43,108 --> 01:37:48,113
<i>If you lose your faith in me,
please keep your faith in people.</i>

1237
01:37:48,697 --> 01:37:53,118
<i>Love, now and always, Rachel.</i>

1238
01:38:01,085 --> 01:38:03,420
Prepared a little breakfast.

1239
01:38:07,549 --> 01:38:09,468
Very well, then.
Alfred.

1240
01:38:09,635 --> 01:38:10,803
Yes, Master Wayne?

1241
01:38:12,179 --> 01:38:14,431
Did I bring this on her?

1242
01:38:15,474 --> 01:38:17,684
I was meant to inspire good...

1243
01:38:17,851 --> 01:38:20,229
not madness, not death.

1244
01:38:20,396 --> 01:38:25,025
You have inspired good. But you spat
in the faces of Gotham's criminals.

1245
01:38:25,192 --> 01:38:27,277
Didn't you think
there might be casualties?

1246
01:38:27,444 --> 01:38:29,863
Things always get worse
before they get better.

1247
01:38:30,197 --> 01:38:31,657
But Rachel, Alfred.

1248
01:38:31,824 --> 01:38:35,619
Rachel believed in what you stood for...

1249
01:38:35,786 --> 01:38:37,704
what we stand for.

1250
01:38:37,871 --> 01:38:39,331
Gotham needs you.

1251
01:38:39,873 --> 01:38:42,835
No, Gotham needs its true hero...

1252
01:38:43,335 --> 01:38:47,464
and I let that murdering psychopath
blow him half to hell.

1253
01:38:47,631 --> 01:38:49,967
Which is why, for now...

1254
01:38:50,759 --> 01:38:52,678
they're gonna have to
make do with you.

1255
01:38:54,888 --> 01:38:56,723
She was gonna wait for me, Alfred.

1256
01:38:58,725 --> 01:39:00,769
Dent doesn't know.

1257
01:39:00,936 --> 01:39:02,229
He can never know.

1258
01:39:04,648 --> 01:39:06,275
What's that?

1259
01:39:06,442 --> 01:39:09,403
It can wait.
That bandit...

1260
01:39:09,862 --> 01:39:11,989
in the forest in Burma.

1261
01:39:12,156 --> 01:39:14,199
Did you catch him?
Yes.

1262
01:39:14,366 --> 01:39:15,701
How?

1263
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:18,745
We burned the forest down.

1264
01:39:57,951 --> 01:40:00,621
<i>He's credible, an M & A lawyer
from a leading consultancy.</i>

1265
01:40:00,787 --> 01:40:04,166
<i>He says he's waited as long as he can
for Batman to do the right thing.</i>

1266
01:40:04,333 --> 01:40:06,418
<i>Now he's taking matters
into his own hands.</i>

1267
01:40:06,585 --> 01:40:09,546
<i>We'll be live at 5 with
the true identity of the Batman.</i>

1268
01:40:25,979 --> 01:40:27,606
I'm sorry about Rachel.

1269
01:40:30,317 --> 01:40:35,155
The doctor says you're in agonizing pain,
but that you won't accept medication.

1270
01:40:36,198 --> 01:40:38,158
That you're refusing to...

1271
01:40:38,325 --> 01:40:40,077
accept skin grafts.

1272
01:40:40,410 --> 01:40:42,663
Remember that name...

1273
01:40:43,247 --> 01:40:45,582
you all had for me...

1274
01:40:46,041 --> 01:40:48,877
when I was at Internal Affairs?

1275
01:40:51,338 --> 01:40:52,631
What was it, Gordon?

1276
01:40:53,298 --> 01:40:54,675
Harvey, I...

1277
01:40:54,841 --> 01:40:56,343
Say it.

1278
01:40:57,761 --> 01:40:59,680
Say it!

1279
01:41:07,354 --> 01:41:10,440
Two-Face. Harvey Two-Face.

1280
01:41:12,025 --> 01:41:16,321
Why should I hide who I am?

1281
01:41:17,531 --> 01:41:18,865
I know you tried to warn me.

1282
01:41:19,741 --> 01:41:20,951
I'm sorry.

1283
01:41:21,577 --> 01:41:24,204
Wuertz picked you up.
Was he working for them?

1284
01:41:26,498 --> 01:41:28,875
Do you know who picked up Rachel?

1285
01:41:29,710 --> 01:41:32,713
Harvey, I need to know
which of my men I can trust.

1286
01:41:33,088 --> 01:41:35,215
Why would you listen to me now?

1287
01:41:36,341 --> 01:41:38,010
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1288
01:41:40,554 --> 01:41:42,347
No.

1289
01:41:42,806 --> 01:41:44,933
No, you're not.

1290
01:41:45,976 --> 01:41:47,227
Not yet.

1291
01:41:52,482 --> 01:41:55,193
This craziness, it's too much.

1292
01:41:55,402 --> 01:41:58,655
Should've thought about that
before you let the clown out of the box.

1293
01:41:58,822 --> 01:42:00,574
You want him?

1294
01:42:03,035 --> 01:42:05,412
I can tell you
where he'll be this afternoon.

1295
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:15,714
Not so crazy as you look.

1296
01:42:15,881 --> 01:42:19,635
I told you, I'm a man of my word.

1297
01:42:22,846 --> 01:42:24,097
Where is the Italian?

1298
01:42:24,264 --> 01:42:27,392
All tactical units will converge
on the location in 20 minutes.

1299
01:42:27,559 --> 01:42:31,021
I want auxiliary units to cover
all possible getaway routes.

1300
01:42:31,605 --> 01:42:32,773
Please.

1301
01:42:32,939 --> 01:42:36,276
Joker-man, what you do
with all your money?

1302
01:42:36,943 --> 01:42:39,613
You see, I'm a guy of simple taste.

1303
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:41,448
I enjoy...

1304
01:42:41,615 --> 01:42:42,991
dynamite...

1305
01:42:43,158 --> 01:42:44,701
and gunpowder...

1306
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:47,579
and gasoline.

1307
01:42:49,039 --> 01:42:51,291
What the...?
Ah, ah, ah.

1308
01:42:53,126 --> 01:42:55,962
And you know the thing
that they have in common?

1309
01:42:56,463 --> 01:42:57,756
They're cheap.

1310
01:42:57,923 --> 01:43:00,604
<i>How much are they
paying you to say who Batman is?</i>

1311
01:43:00,759 --> 01:43:04,721
This is our chance. I want Lau alive.
The Joker, either way.

1312
01:43:04,888 --> 01:43:06,306
Hey, Jim. Get a load of this.

1313
01:43:06,473 --> 01:43:07,873
<i>Let's take the next caller.</i>

1314
01:43:07,974 --> 01:43:10,255
<i>Harvey Dent didn't wanna
give in to this maniac.</i>

1315
01:43:10,310 --> 01:43:11,603
<i>You think you know better?</i>

1316
01:43:11,770 --> 01:43:15,148
<i>I think that if we could talk to
Dent today, he may feel differently.</i>

1317
01:43:15,315 --> 01:43:19,403
<i>And we wish him a speedy recovery.
Because God knows, we need him now.</i>

1318
01:43:19,569 --> 01:43:21,780
You said you were a man of your word.

1319
01:43:22,072 --> 01:43:24,116
Oh, I am.

1320
01:43:25,826 --> 01:43:28,495
I'm only burning my half.

1321
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:31,957
All you care about is money.

1322
01:43:32,124 --> 01:43:35,585
This town deserves
a better class of criminal...

1323
01:43:35,752 --> 01:43:38,004
and I'm gonna give it to them.

1324
01:43:38,797 --> 01:43:41,299
Tell your men they work for me now.

1325
01:43:41,466 --> 01:43:43,844
This is my city.

1326
01:43:44,511 --> 01:43:47,055
They won't work for a freak.

1327
01:43:47,222 --> 01:43:48,932
"Freak."

1328
01:43:49,099 --> 01:43:51,579
Why don't we
cut you up into little pieces...

1329
01:43:51,727 --> 01:43:53,186
and feed you to your pooches? Hm?

1330
01:43:53,353 --> 01:43:56,231
And then we'll see how loyal
a hungry dog really is.

1331
01:43:58,233 --> 01:44:00,569
It's not about money...

1332
01:44:00,736 --> 01:44:03,947
it's about sending a message.

1333
01:44:04,740 --> 01:44:07,200
Everything burns.

1334
01:44:09,703 --> 01:44:11,872
<i>Who is this? I had a vision...</i>

1335
01:44:12,038 --> 01:44:14,791
<i>of a world without Batman.</i>

1336
01:44:14,958 --> 01:44:17,210
<i>The Mob ground out a little profit...</i>

1337
01:44:17,377 --> 01:44:21,298
<i>and the police tried to shut them down
one block at a time.</i>

1338
01:44:21,465 --> 01:44:24,760
<i>And it was so boring.</i>

1339
01:44:24,926 --> 01:44:26,887
<i>I've had a change of heart.</i>

1340
01:44:27,053 --> 01:44:29,681
<i>I don't want Mr. Reese
spoiling everything...</i>

1341
01:44:29,848 --> 01:44:34,561
<i>but why should I have all the fun?
Let's give someone else a chance.</i>

1342
01:44:34,728 --> 01:44:39,566
<i>If Coleman Reese
isn't dead in 60 minutes...</i>

1343
01:44:39,733 --> 01:44:41,818
<i>then I blow up a hospital.</i>

1344
01:44:41,985 --> 01:44:43,570
Call in every officer.

1345
01:44:43,737 --> 01:44:47,073
Tell them to head to their nearest hospital
and start evac and search.

1346
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:51,161
Call the transit authority, school board,
prisons. Get every bus down to a hospital.

1347
01:44:51,328 --> 01:44:55,916
The priority is Gotham General. Wheel
everybody out of that place right now.

1348
01:44:56,082 --> 01:44:57,751
You, you and you, you come with me.

1349
01:44:57,918 --> 01:44:59,836
Where are we going, sir?
To get Reese.

1350
01:45:00,086 --> 01:45:03,215
I need you plugged in,
checking Gordon's men and their families.

1351
01:45:03,381 --> 01:45:05,592
Looking for?
Hospital admissions.

1352
01:45:05,759 --> 01:45:07,427
Will you be wanting the Batpod?

1353
01:45:07,594 --> 01:45:09,554
In the middle of the day?
Not very subtle.

1354
01:45:09,721 --> 01:45:11,014
The Lamborghini, then.

1355
01:45:11,932 --> 01:45:13,058
Much more subtle.

1356
01:45:26,905 --> 01:45:29,407
Excuse me. Let me through.
Excuse me. Okay.

1357
01:45:29,574 --> 01:45:33,078
Sir, could you help, please?

1358
01:45:33,245 --> 01:45:34,955
I'm gonna find a bus for him.

1359
01:45:36,915 --> 01:45:38,795
Sir? Commissioner, do you really think...

1360
01:45:38,959 --> 01:45:41,127
an ordinary citizen
would try to kill this man?

1361
01:45:45,632 --> 01:45:47,968
Sir. Commissioner.

1362
01:45:50,053 --> 01:45:52,264
Get the cars around the back!

1363
01:45:54,641 --> 01:45:55,976
Go. Keep rolling, Sam.

1364
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:03,900
I see O'Brien and Richards.

1365
01:46:04,484 --> 01:46:07,988
No immediate family member
admitted to a Gotham hospital.

1366
01:46:09,281 --> 01:46:12,826
They're trying to kill me.
Well, maybe Batman can save you.

1367
01:46:25,964 --> 01:46:28,592
Davis, they got space. Bring him out.

1368
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:32,053
Davis.

1369
01:46:37,183 --> 01:46:39,519
I saw Burns and Zachary.

1370
01:46:39,686 --> 01:46:40,896
<i>Nothing on them.</i>

1371
01:46:41,062 --> 01:46:42,522
And a patrolman I don't know.

1372
01:46:43,732 --> 01:46:45,650
Okay, so, what now?

1373
01:46:46,526 --> 01:46:48,778
What do we do now?
Where are we going?

1374
01:46:51,531 --> 01:46:53,199
Send the information to Gordon.

1375
01:47:01,041 --> 01:47:02,626
Get out of here.

1376
01:47:04,669 --> 01:47:06,463
Davis.

1377
01:47:09,633 --> 01:47:12,052
Ma'am, we're gonna have to
move him now.

1378
01:47:23,730 --> 01:47:26,066
It's Berg, isn't it?
Commissioner.

1379
01:47:27,192 --> 01:47:28,652
You okay, son?

1380
01:47:46,670 --> 01:47:48,254
Hi.

1381
01:47:53,093 --> 01:47:54,594
You know...

1382
01:47:55,428 --> 01:47:58,515
I don't want there to be
any hard feelings between us, Harvey.

1383
01:47:58,682 --> 01:48:01,810
When you and...
Rachel!

1384
01:48:01,977 --> 01:48:04,270
Rachel were being abducted...

1385
01:48:04,437 --> 01:48:07,440
I was sitting in Gordon's cage.

1386
01:48:07,774 --> 01:48:09,693
I didn't rig those charges.

1387
01:48:09,901 --> 01:48:12,362
Your men, your plan.

1388
01:48:12,570 --> 01:48:15,031
Do I really look like a guy with a plan?

1389
01:48:15,448 --> 01:48:18,243
You know what I am?
I'm a dog chasing cars.

1390
01:48:18,868 --> 01:48:21,329
I wouldn't know what to do with one
if I caught it.

1391
01:48:21,496 --> 01:48:24,624
You know? I just do things.

1392
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,712
The Mob has plans. The cops have plans.

1393
01:48:28,878 --> 01:48:31,089
Gordon's got plans.

1394
01:48:31,256 --> 01:48:34,217
You know, they're schemers.

1395
01:48:34,384 --> 01:48:38,138
Schemers trying to control
their little worlds.

1396
01:48:38,304 --> 01:48:39,806
I'm not a schemer.

1397
01:48:39,973 --> 01:48:41,599
I try to show the schemers...

1398
01:48:41,766 --> 01:48:47,063
how pathetic their attempts
to control things really are.

1399
01:48:48,023 --> 01:48:51,067
So when I say... Ah. Come here.

1400
01:48:51,568 --> 01:48:55,113
When I say that you and your girlfriend
was nothing personal...

1401
01:48:56,656 --> 01:48:58,867
you'll know that I'm telling the truth.

1402
01:49:01,369 --> 01:49:04,164
I'm gonna need your weapon.
What?

1403
01:49:07,917 --> 01:49:09,753
Why? Because my wife's in the hospital?

1404
01:49:10,462 --> 01:49:12,005
Yeah, that'd be why.

1405
01:49:12,922 --> 01:49:16,134
It's the schemers
that put you where you are.

1406
01:49:16,301 --> 01:49:20,096
You were a schemer, you had plans...

1407
01:49:20,263 --> 01:49:22,432
and look where that got you.

1408
01:49:33,193 --> 01:49:35,593
<i>Police are taking every precaution...</i>

1409
01:49:35,737 --> 01:49:37,864
<i>urging people not to
take matters into their hands.</i>

1410
01:49:38,031 --> 01:49:40,575
I just did what I do best.

1411
01:49:40,742 --> 01:49:44,370
I took your little plan
and I turned it on itself.

1412
01:49:44,537 --> 01:49:49,876
Look what I did to this city with
a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets.

1413
01:49:50,043 --> 01:49:53,338
Hm? You know what I noticed?

1414
01:49:53,505 --> 01:49:57,050
Nobody panics when
things go "according to plan."

1415
01:49:57,217 --> 01:49:58,885
Even if the plan is horrifying.

1416
01:49:59,511 --> 01:50:04,557
If tomorrow I tell the press that, like,
a gangbanger will get shot...

1417
01:50:04,724 --> 01:50:08,186
or a truckload of soldiers
will be blowing up...

1418
01:50:08,478 --> 01:50:09,562
nobody panics.

1419
01:50:10,271 --> 01:50:13,358
Because it's all part of the plan.

1420
01:50:13,525 --> 01:50:18,446
But when I say that
one little old mayor will die...

1421
01:50:18,696 --> 01:50:21,116
well, then, everyone loses their minds.

1422
01:50:24,536 --> 01:50:27,455
Introduce a little anarchy...

1423
01:50:28,623 --> 01:50:30,875
upset the established order...

1424
01:50:31,042 --> 01:50:35,588
and everything becomes chaos.

1425
01:50:37,423 --> 01:50:40,176
I'm an agent of chaos.

1426
01:50:40,552 --> 01:50:42,887
Oh, and you know the thing
about chaos?

1427
01:50:44,931 --> 01:50:46,558
It's fair.

1428
01:50:55,775 --> 01:50:58,945
You live.
Mm-hm.

1429
01:50:59,445 --> 01:51:01,072
You die.

1430
01:51:01,281 --> 01:51:03,283
Mmm. Now we're talking.

1431
01:51:12,625 --> 01:51:14,127
Mr. Reese.

1432
01:51:32,312 --> 01:51:34,480
That's Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

1433
01:51:34,647 --> 01:51:37,650
That was a very brave thing you did.
Trying to catch the light?

1434
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:40,820
You weren't protecting the van?
Why? Who's in it?

1435
01:51:46,284 --> 01:51:48,369
Don't you think
I should go to the hospital?

1436
01:51:48,536 --> 01:51:51,039
Don't watch a whole lot of news,
do you, Mr. Wayne?

1437
01:52:57,188 --> 01:52:59,023
Southeast.

1438
01:52:59,190 --> 01:53:01,401
It's Gotham General.

1439
01:53:02,151 --> 01:53:03,871
Did you clear the building?
Yeah.

1440
01:53:06,823 --> 01:53:10,076
You must know how many were inside.
You have patient lists, roll call.

1441
01:53:10,243 --> 01:53:12,578
Right now we're showing
50 people missing. One bus.

1442
01:53:12,745 --> 01:53:15,915
The other buses were heading off to
hospitals. I guess we missed one.

1443
01:53:16,082 --> 01:53:18,209
What's your guess
about where Harvey Dent is?

1444
01:53:18,376 --> 01:53:22,839
Keep looking. And keep it to yourself.
Anybody asks, we got him out.

1445
01:53:25,425 --> 01:53:27,844
Get me the mayor's office on the line.

1446
01:53:29,012 --> 01:53:30,763
We're gonna need the National Guard.

1447
01:53:30,930 --> 01:53:34,010
<i>People are still
missing, including GCN's own Mike Engel.</i>

1448
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:37,353
<i>I'm now being told that we're cutting to
a video GCN has just received.</i>

1449
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:39,439
<i>I'm Mike Engel for Gotham Tonight.</i>

1450
01:53:39,939 --> 01:53:43,276
<i>"What does it take
to make you people wanna join in?"</i>

1451
01:53:43,443 --> 01:53:46,043
<i>You failed to kill the lawyer.
I've gotta get you off the bench...</i>

1452
01:53:46,195 --> 01:53:47,955
<i>and into the game. Bench. Game.</i>

1453
01:53:50,116 --> 01:53:52,243
<i>Come nightfall, this city is mine.
Mine.</i>

1454
01:53:52,410 --> 01:53:55,163
<i>And anyone left here plays by my rules.
Rules.</i>

1455
01:53:55,455 --> 01:53:58,791
Mr. Fox? Security is showing
a break-in at the R <i>&</i> D Department.

1456
01:53:58,958 --> 01:54:01,085
<i>If you don't wanna be in the game...</i>

1457
01:54:01,252 --> 01:54:02,628
<i>get out now.
Get out now.</i>

1458
01:54:04,797 --> 01:54:07,759
<i>But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd
are sure in for a surprise.</i>

1459
01:54:08,134 --> 01:54:09,844
<i>Ha-ha, ha-ha.</i>

1460
01:54:43,503 --> 01:54:45,755
Gotham P.D. has shut down...
Sweet Jesus.

1461
01:54:45,922 --> 01:54:47,423
<i>The area's bridges and tunnels.</i>

1462
01:54:47,590 --> 01:54:51,010
Shouldn't you be out there,
you know, doing something?

1463
01:54:51,177 --> 01:54:53,137
It's my day off.

1464
01:54:53,763 --> 01:54:55,348
I gotta take a leak.

1465
01:54:55,515 --> 01:54:57,850
Keep an eye out for me, will you?

1466
01:55:03,439 --> 01:55:05,400
Now what?
Need someone to shake it for you?

1467
01:55:05,566 --> 01:55:07,151
Hello.

1468
01:55:07,860 --> 01:55:09,362
Dent.

1469
01:55:09,529 --> 01:55:11,739
Jesus. I thought you was dead.

1470
01:55:11,906 --> 01:55:13,574
Half.

1471
01:55:19,622 --> 01:55:21,207
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?

1472
01:55:21,374 --> 01:55:23,376
It must've been Maroni's men.
Shut up!

1473
01:55:25,128 --> 01:55:29,173
Are you telling me that you're gonna
protect the other traitor in Gordon's unit?

1474
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:30,800
I don't know, he never told me.

1475
01:55:30,967 --> 01:55:34,595
Listen, Dent, I swear to God, I didn't know
what they were gonna do to you.

1476
01:55:36,139 --> 01:55:37,306
That's funny...

1477
01:55:39,058 --> 01:55:41,811
because I don't know
what's gonna happen to you either.

1478
01:55:45,898 --> 01:55:47,859
Beautiful, isn't it?

1479
01:55:48,234 --> 01:55:49,902
Beautiful.

1480
01:55:50,445 --> 01:55:51,571
Unethical.

1481
01:55:52,738 --> 01:55:54,282
Dangerous.

1482
01:55:54,490 --> 01:55:57,994
You've turned every cell phone in Gotham
into a microphone.

1483
01:55:58,161 --> 01:56:00,580
And a high-frequency generator-receiver.

1484
01:56:00,746 --> 01:56:05,835
You took my sonar concept
and applied it to every phone in the city.

1485
01:56:06,002 --> 01:56:10,590
With half the city feeding you sonar,
you can image all of Gotham.

1486
01:56:12,508 --> 01:56:13,885
This is wrong.

1487
01:56:14,051 --> 01:56:16,095
I've gotta find this man, Lucius.

1488
01:56:18,097 --> 01:56:19,390
At what cost?

1489
01:56:19,557 --> 01:56:22,351
The database is null-key encrypted.

1490
01:56:22,518 --> 01:56:24,729
It can only be accessed by one person.

1491
01:56:26,063 --> 01:56:28,232
This is too much power for one person.

1492
01:56:28,399 --> 01:56:30,568
That's why I gave it to you.

1493
01:56:31,027 --> 01:56:32,236
Only you can use it.

1494
01:56:32,403 --> 01:56:36,199
Spying on 30 million people
isn't part of my job description.

1495
01:56:38,409 --> 01:56:42,121
This is an audio sample. If he talks
within range of any phone in the city...

1496
01:56:42,288 --> 01:56:44,499
you can triangulate his position.

1497
01:56:44,957 --> 01:56:47,460
I'll help you this one time.

1498
01:56:47,919 --> 01:56:49,712
But consider this my resignation.

1499
01:56:49,879 --> 01:56:54,467
As long as this machine is
at Wayne Enterprises, I won't be.

1500
01:56:55,218 --> 01:56:57,136
When you're finished...

1501
01:56:57,803 --> 01:56:58,930
type in your name.

1502
01:57:07,522 --> 01:57:10,608
My officers are going over
every inch of the tunnels and bridges...

1503
01:57:10,775 --> 01:57:13,986
but with the Joker's threat,
they're not an option.

1504
01:57:14,153 --> 01:57:16,989
And land routes east?
Backed up for hours.

1505
01:57:17,156 --> 01:57:20,785
Which leaves the ferries
with 30,000 ready to board.

1506
01:57:20,952 --> 01:57:23,996
I wanna use the ferries so I can
get those prisoners off the island.

1507
01:57:24,330 --> 01:57:27,124
The men you put away?
Those aren't people I'm worried about.

1508
01:57:27,291 --> 01:57:29,418
You should be.
Whatever the Joker's planning...

1509
01:57:29,585 --> 01:57:34,090
it's a good bet Harvey's prisoners are
involved. I wanna get them out of here.

1510
01:57:35,550 --> 01:57:36,759
So where is Harvey?

1511
01:57:37,343 --> 01:57:40,513
We haven't found him.
Oh, Jesus.

1512
01:57:44,350 --> 01:57:46,435
How long can you keep this quiet?

1513
01:58:00,533 --> 01:58:03,202
Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.

1514
01:58:04,036 --> 01:58:06,205
Going to join your wife?

1515
01:58:09,709 --> 01:58:12,211
You love her?
Yes.

1516
01:58:13,087 --> 01:58:16,048
You ever imagine what it would be like
to listen to her die?

1517
01:58:16,215 --> 01:58:17,717
Look, take it up with the Joker.

1518
01:58:17,883 --> 01:58:21,137
He killed your woman. He made you...

1519
01:58:21,304 --> 01:58:22,346
like this.

1520
01:58:22,722 --> 01:58:25,725
The Joker's just a mad dog.

1521
01:58:25,891 --> 01:58:28,519
I want whoever let him off the leash.

1522
01:58:29,228 --> 01:58:32,565
I took care of Wuertz, but who was
your other man inside Gordon's unit?

1523
01:58:32,732 --> 01:58:35,359
Who picked up Rachel?
Must have been someone she trusted.

1524
01:58:36,569 --> 01:58:38,696
Look, if I tell you...

1525
01:58:38,863 --> 01:58:39,905
will you let me go?

1526
01:58:40,656 --> 01:58:41,991
Can't hurt your chances.

1527
01:58:44,744 --> 01:58:46,412
It was Ramirez.

1528
01:58:51,834 --> 01:58:55,087
But you said...
I said it couldn't hurt your chances.

1529
01:58:58,674 --> 01:59:00,801
You're a lucky man.

1530
01:59:04,263 --> 01:59:06,015
But he's not.
Who?

1531
01:59:08,934 --> 01:59:10,353
Your driver.

1532
01:59:23,616 --> 01:59:24,617
Stand back.

1533
01:59:24,784 --> 01:59:27,119
Hey, that ain't right.
We should be on that boat.

1534
01:59:27,286 --> 01:59:29,872
You wanna ride across
with them? Be my guest.

1535
01:59:53,104 --> 01:59:54,945
Sir, they've stopped their engines.

1536
01:59:54,980 --> 01:59:55,981
Right, get on the radio.

1537
01:59:56,148 --> 01:59:59,819
Tell them we'll come back and pick them up
once we dump the scumbags.

1538
01:59:59,985 --> 02:00:02,363
<i>Liberty, this</i> is <i>Spirit. Come in.</i>

1539
02:00:04,407 --> 02:00:05,647
What the heck was that?

1540
02:00:07,535 --> 02:00:08,994
What the...?

1541
02:00:09,537 --> 02:00:12,832
Liberty, come in,
please. This <i>is</i> Spirit. Come in.

1542
02:00:14,417 --> 02:00:16,335
<i>Liberty, we have the same thing.
We've lost both engines.</i>

1543
02:00:16,502 --> 02:00:18,003
Liberty, <i>come</i> in.
Fox.

1544
02:00:18,170 --> 02:00:20,673
<i>There's something going on
on the ferries.</i>

1545
02:00:21,424 --> 02:00:23,718
Get down to the engine room now.

1546
02:00:24,343 --> 02:00:26,554
Hey, buddy, what's happening?

1547
02:00:35,146 --> 02:00:38,607
Captain, we got a hundred barrels
down there rigged to blow. And this.

1548
02:00:51,704 --> 02:00:52,788
Oh, my God.

1549
02:00:52,955 --> 02:00:54,790
Looks like some kind of detonator.

1550
02:00:54,957 --> 02:00:57,835
Why would they give us
the detonator to our own bomb?

1551
02:01:00,755 --> 02:01:04,049
Tonight, you're all
gonna be</i> a <i>part of</i> a <i>social experiment.</i>

1552
02:01:07,887 --> 02:01:11,724
<i>Through the magic of diesel fuel
and ammonium nitrate...</i>

1553
02:01:11,891 --> 02:01:15,978
<i>I'm ready right now
to blow you all sky-high.</i>

1554
02:01:16,145 --> 02:01:18,230
<i>Liberty, come 'm, over.</i>

1555
02:01:19,690 --> 02:01:20,733
It's dead.

1556
02:01:21,066 --> 02:01:25,571
<i>If anyone attempts
to get off their boat, you all die.</i>

1557
02:01:25,905 --> 02:01:27,198
<i>I'm zeroing in.</i>

1558
02:01:27,364 --> 02:01:31,911
<i>Each of you has</i> a <i>remote
to blow up the other boat.</i>

1559
02:01:32,077 --> 02:01:34,538
His voice is on the ferry...

1560
02:01:34,705 --> 02:01:36,749
but it's not the source.

1561
02:01:39,001 --> 02:01:40,127
West.

1562
02:01:47,384 --> 02:01:49,678
<i>I have the Joker's location.</i>

1563
02:01:49,845 --> 02:01:50,930
<i>Prewitt Building.</i>

1564
02:01:51,096 --> 02:01:53,557
<i>Assemble on the building opposite.</i>

1565
02:01:54,934 --> 02:01:57,728
At midnight, I blow you all up.

1566
02:01:57,895 --> 02:02:03,067
<i>If, however, one of you presses the button,
I'll let that boat live.</i>

1567
02:02:03,234 --> 02:02:05,361
<i>So who's it gonna be?</i>

1568
02:02:05,528 --> 02:02:08,072
<i>Harvey Dent's most-wanted
scumbag collection...</i>

1569
02:02:08,239 --> 02:02:11,575
<i>or the sweet and innocent civilians?</i>

1570
02:02:11,742 --> 02:02:14,286
<i>You choose.</i>

1571
02:02:14,453 --> 02:02:16,372
<i>Oh, and you might wanna
decide quickly...</i>

1572
02:02:16,539 --> 02:02:20,876
<i>because the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble.</i>

1573
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:29,301
Stay back.

1574
02:02:29,468 --> 02:02:33,264
Well, now, who are you to decide?
We ought to talk this over, at least.

1575
02:02:33,639 --> 02:02:37,226
We don't all have to die.
Those men had their chance.

1576
02:02:37,852 --> 02:02:41,647
We are not going to talk about this.
Why aren't we talking about it?

1577
02:02:41,814 --> 02:02:44,400
They're talking over the same thing
on the other boat.

1578
02:02:44,567 --> 02:02:46,861
Let's put it to a vote.
Yes!

1579
02:02:52,157 --> 02:02:54,743
Hello?
Barbara, <i>it's</i> Anna Ramirez.

1580
02:02:54,910 --> 02:02:57,955
Jim needs you to pack up
and put the kids in the car right away.

1581
02:02:58,122 --> 02:02:59,832
But the units outside...

1582
02:02:59,999 --> 02:03:01,584
<i>Those cops can't be trusted.</i>

1583
02:03:01,750 --> 02:03:04,712
Jim needs you away from them
as soon as possible.

1584
02:03:04,879 --> 02:03:07,840
I'll call them off for 10 minutes,
and you'll have to move fast.

1585
02:03:08,007 --> 02:03:11,844
<i>But where am I supposed to take them?
125052nd Sweet.</i>

1586
02:03:12,011 --> 02:03:13,813
<i>Leave as soon as the
patrol car pulls out.</i>

1587
02:03:13,825 --> 02:03:14,430
Okay.

1588
02:03:15,806 --> 02:03:17,600
She believe you?

1589
02:03:17,808 --> 02:03:19,852
It's because she trusts you...

1590
02:03:20,185 --> 02:03:21,270
just like Rachel did.

1591
02:03:21,437 --> 02:03:23,522
I didn't know...
Didn't know what they'd do?

1592
02:03:23,689 --> 02:03:26,442
You're the second cop to say that to me.

1593
02:03:26,692 --> 02:03:28,819
What exactly did you think
they were gonna do?

1594
02:03:28,986 --> 02:03:31,238
They got me early on.
My mother's hospital bills...

1595
02:03:31,405 --> 02:03:34,450
Don't!
I'm sorry.

1596
02:03:34,992 --> 02:03:37,453
You live to fight another day, officer.

1597
02:03:41,248 --> 02:03:43,089
We found the missing hospital bus.

1598
02:03:43,250 --> 02:03:44,960
Then we have a hostage situation.

1599
02:03:47,046 --> 02:03:49,048
It's a shooting gallery.

1600
02:03:49,423 --> 02:03:51,717
Why would he choose a spot
with such big windows?

1601
02:03:51,884 --> 02:03:53,764
We have clear shots on five clowns.

1602
02:03:53,886 --> 02:03:56,639
<i>Snipers take them out,
smash the windows, a team rappels in.</i>

1603
02:03:57,056 --> 02:03:58,557
<i>Team moves in by the stairwells.</i>

1604
02:03:58,724 --> 02:04:00,851
<i>Two, three casualties max.</i>

1605
02:04:01,018 --> 02:04:02,895
Let's do it.
It's not that simple.

1606
02:04:03,062 --> 02:04:05,397
With the Joker, it never is.
What's simple is...

1607
02:04:05,564 --> 02:04:08,734
every second, those people on the
ferries get closer to blowing...

1608
02:04:08,901 --> 02:04:11,445
That won't happen.
Then he'll blow both of them up!

1609
02:04:11,612 --> 02:04:15,366
We don't have time for paper ballots.
I want everybody to put their votes...

1610
02:04:15,532 --> 02:04:17,534
on this piece of paper.

1611
02:04:18,577 --> 02:04:21,413
If anyone's got pens, pass it along.

1612
02:04:21,747 --> 02:04:25,542
Thank you. Anybody else?
Coming through. Anybody else? Thank you.

1613
02:04:25,709 --> 02:04:28,587
We need to get these votes in quickly.

1614
02:04:28,754 --> 02:04:30,297
Come on.

1615
02:04:32,299 --> 02:04:34,426
What are you waiting for?
Push the button!

1616
02:04:34,593 --> 02:04:36,553
We're running out of time!

1617
02:04:37,846 --> 02:04:39,682
I need five minutes alone.

1618
02:04:39,848 --> 02:04:41,684
No! There's no time!

1619
02:04:41,850 --> 02:04:43,268
We have clear shots!

1620
02:04:43,435 --> 02:04:46,355
Dent is in there with them.
We have to save Dent!

1621
02:04:46,522 --> 02:04:48,482
I have to save Dent.

1622
02:04:48,649 --> 02:04:49,775
Get ready.

1623
02:04:52,611 --> 02:04:55,280
Two minutes, then we breach.

1624
02:05:00,869 --> 02:05:02,371
Fox, I need picture.

1625
02:05:05,416 --> 02:05:07,876
Hello?
Jim, <i>we're</i> in trouble.

1626
02:05:09,128 --> 02:05:11,422
Okay, you got POV on alpha...

1627
02:05:12,464 --> 02:05:14,425
<i>omni on beta.</i>

1628
02:05:15,884 --> 02:05:19,263
<i>Looks like clowns and hostages
on two floors.</i>

1629
02:05:19,430 --> 02:05:21,849
<i>There's a SWAT team on the stairwell.</i>

1630
02:05:25,144 --> 02:05:27,771
<i>Another SWAT team on the roof.</i>

1631
02:05:29,314 --> 02:05:30,524
Line's clear.

1632
02:05:32,276 --> 02:05:34,987
Barbara, calm down.
He has the <i>kids!</i>

1633
02:05:35,154 --> 02:05:38,407
Hello, Jim.
Harvey?

1634
02:05:39,199 --> 02:05:42,411
<i>Where's</i> my <i>family?
Where my family died.</i>

1635
02:05:45,497 --> 02:05:47,177
<i>Blue team, acquire the target.</i>

1636
02:05:48,834 --> 02:05:51,420
<i>Entry team, set your charge.</i>

1637
02:06:07,352 --> 02:06:10,856
<i>Fox, the SWATs are targeting the
wrong people. The clowns are the hostages.</i>

1638
02:06:11,565 --> 02:06:13,358
Red team, go! Red team, go!

1639
02:06:17,112 --> 02:06:18,530
<i>Entry team, blow and go!</i>

1640
02:06:22,618 --> 02:06:24,036
Don't move.

1641
02:06:25,204 --> 02:06:26,580
<i>Take the shot.</i>

1642
02:06:32,211 --> 02:06:33,879
<i>Those SWATs are coming in hot.</i>

1643
02:06:34,046 --> 02:06:35,881
Clowns, put down your guns.

1644
02:06:36,381 --> 02:06:39,009
Drop your weapons!
On the ground, now!

1645
02:06:39,218 --> 02:06:42,387
Doctors, get down!
Clear the line of fire. Drop your weap...

1646
02:07:06,995 --> 02:07:08,163
Freeze!

1647
02:07:08,330 --> 02:07:10,707
Stand down or you will be...

1648
02:07:14,253 --> 02:07:15,712
Look up.

1649
02:07:16,296 --> 02:07:18,882
<i>See those bad guys on the floor above?</i>

1650
02:07:19,049 --> 02:07:22,052
<i>They're waiting to ambush the SWAT team
coming up the elevator.</i>

1651
02:07:22,511 --> 02:07:23,554
<i>Sixty seconds.</i>

1652
02:07:31,854 --> 02:07:36,441
The tally is 140 against, 396 for.

1653
02:07:44,575 --> 02:07:47,119
So go ahead. Do it.

1654
02:07:47,286 --> 02:07:49,288
We're still here.

1655
02:07:50,455 --> 02:07:53,417
And that means they haven't
killed us yet either.

1656
02:07:54,877 --> 02:07:56,628
Go, go, go!

1657
02:07:56,795 --> 02:07:58,589
Blue team, cover!

1658
02:08:01,550 --> 02:08:02,593
Uh-oh.

1659
02:08:04,094 --> 02:08:05,762
<i>Trouble on the floor above.</i>

1660
02:08:15,105 --> 02:08:16,481
Get down on the ground now!

1661
02:08:24,907 --> 02:08:27,326
Freeze! Stop or we will shoot.

1662
02:08:27,492 --> 02:08:29,494
We will shoot you. Drop the officer.

1663
02:08:29,661 --> 02:08:33,332
Release the officer right now.
Let him go now! On your knees!

1664
02:08:33,916 --> 02:08:36,001
We got him. He's out of the game.

1665
02:08:36,168 --> 02:08:38,849
Keep your hands in the air!
Step away from the edge!

1666
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:48,347
Halt!

1667
02:09:01,652 --> 02:09:03,028
Stay down!
Don't move!

1668
02:09:03,195 --> 02:09:07,491
<i>Be advised.
Clowns are hostages, doctors are targets.</i>

1669
02:09:13,789 --> 02:09:15,958
Ah, you made it. I'm so thrilled.

1670
02:09:16,124 --> 02:09:19,294
Where's the detonator?
Go get him.

1671
02:09:32,683 --> 02:09:35,769
Put down your weapon!
Don't move!

1672
02:10:07,175 --> 02:10:09,052
You don't wanna die...

1673
02:10:09,219 --> 02:10:12,264
but you don't know how to take a life.

1674
02:10:12,431 --> 02:10:14,099
Give it to me.

1675
02:10:14,391 --> 02:10:18,729
These men will kill you
and take it anyway.

1676
02:10:22,149 --> 02:10:24,651
No one wants to get their hands dirty.

1677
02:10:24,818 --> 02:10:27,779
Fine. I'll do it.

1678
02:10:29,448 --> 02:10:32,159
Those men on that boat?
They made their choices.

1679
02:10:32,326 --> 02:10:34,619
They chose to murder and steal.

1680
02:10:34,786 --> 02:10:37,998
It doesn't make any sense
for us to have to die too.

1681
02:10:47,466 --> 02:10:49,926
All the old familiar places.

1682
02:10:56,224 --> 02:10:57,309
Stand by.

1683
02:11:07,652 --> 02:11:11,239
Red team, floor secure.
Hostages are safe.

1684
02:11:11,448 --> 02:11:13,533
Give it to me.

1685
02:11:14,951 --> 02:11:18,705
You can tell them I took it by force.

1686
02:11:19,206 --> 02:11:24,127
Give it to me, and I'll do what
you should've did 10 minutes ago.

1687
02:11:46,191 --> 02:11:49,528
We really should stop this fighting,
otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.

1688
02:11:49,694 --> 02:11:51,530
There won't be any fireworks.

1689
02:11:51,947 --> 02:11:55,158
And here we go.

1690
02:12:34,489 --> 02:12:36,408
What were you trying to prove?

1691
02:12:36,575 --> 02:12:39,536
That deep down,
everyone's as ugly as you?

1692
02:12:40,662 --> 02:12:41,705
You're alone.

1693
02:12:48,295 --> 02:12:53,800
Can't rely on anyone these days.
You gotta do everything yourself. Don't we?

1694
02:12:54,009 --> 02:12:56,845
That's okay. I came prepared.

1695
02:12:57,053 --> 02:13:01,516
It's a funny world we live in. Speaking of
which, you know how I got these scars?

1696
02:13:01,683 --> 02:13:04,519
No, but I know how you got these.

1697
02:13:22,329 --> 02:13:25,081
Oh, you.

1698
02:13:25,248 --> 02:13:28,293
You just couldn't let me go, could you?

1699
02:13:29,419 --> 02:13:33,340
This is what happens
when an unstoppable force...

1700
02:13:33,507 --> 02:13:37,969
meets an immovable object.

1701
02:13:38,553 --> 02:13:43,975
You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?

1702
02:13:44,142 --> 02:13:46,853
Huh? You won't kill me...

1703
02:13:47,020 --> 02:13:53,276
out of some misplaced sense
of self-righteousness.

1704
02:13:53,443 --> 02:13:56,655
And I won't kill you...

1705
02:13:56,821 --> 02:14:00,617
because you're just too much fun.

1706
02:14:01,660 --> 02:14:05,830
I think you and I are destined
to do this forever.

1707
02:14:05,997 --> 02:14:07,999
You'll be in a padded cell forever.

1708
02:14:08,166 --> 02:14:10,001
Maybe we could share one.

1709
02:14:10,168 --> 02:14:12,356
You know, they'll be
doubling up, the rate this

1710
02:14:12,368 --> 02:14:14,339
city's inhabitants are
losing their minds.

1711
02:14:14,506 --> 02:14:17,634
This city just showed you...

1712
02:14:17,801 --> 02:14:21,846
that it's full of people
ready to believe in good.

1713
02:14:22,013 --> 02:14:25,183
Until their spirit breaks completely.

1714
02:14:26,059 --> 02:14:30,897
Until they get a good look
at the real Harvey Dent...

1715
02:14:31,064 --> 02:14:33,858
and all the heroic things he's done.

1716
02:14:35,527 --> 02:14:40,574
You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle
for Gotham's soul...

1717
02:14:40,740 --> 02:14:43,660
in a fistfight with you?

1718
02:14:44,202 --> 02:14:45,745
No.

1719
02:14:45,912 --> 02:14:49,332
You need an ace in the hole.

1720
02:14:49,499 --> 02:14:51,126
Mine's Harvey.

1721
02:14:51,501 --> 02:14:53,211
What did you do?

1722
02:14:53,378 --> 02:14:56,381
I took Gotham's white knight...

1723
02:14:56,548 --> 02:15:00,176
and I brought him down to our level.

1724
02:15:00,594 --> 02:15:03,555
It wasn't hard.
See, madness, as you know...

1725
02:15:03,722 --> 02:15:06,766
is like gravity.

1726
02:15:06,933 --> 02:15:09,269
All it takes is a little push.

1727
02:15:26,202 --> 02:15:27,954
Dent!

1728
02:15:48,933 --> 02:15:53,271
This is where they brought her,
Gordon, after your men handed her over.

1729
02:15:54,022 --> 02:15:55,607
This is where she died.

1730
02:15:55,774 --> 02:15:58,109
I know, I was here...

1731
02:15:59,152 --> 02:16:01,905
trying to save her.
But you didn't.

1732
02:16:02,197 --> 02:16:03,040
I couldn't.

1733
02:16:03,052 --> 02:16:05,617
Yes, you could've. If
you'd listened to me.

1734
02:16:05,784 --> 02:16:08,411
If you stood up against corruption...

1735
02:16:08,578 --> 02:16:10,789
instead of doing your deal
with the devil.

1736
02:16:10,955 --> 02:16:12,582
I was trying to fight the Mob!

1737
02:16:13,083 --> 02:16:17,921
You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself
if you knew what I'd lost.

1738
02:16:19,214 --> 02:16:22,342
Have you ever had to talk to the person
you loved most...

1739
02:16:22,509 --> 02:16:26,388
tell them it's gonna be all right,
when you know it's not'?

1740
02:16:28,056 --> 02:16:31,935
Well, you're about to know
what that feels like, Gordon.

1741
02:16:32,686 --> 02:16:36,564
Then you can look me in the eye
and tell me you're sorry.

1742
02:16:38,316 --> 02:16:41,903
You're not going to hurt my family.
No.

1743
02:16:42,070 --> 02:16:44,781
Just the person you love most.

1744
02:16:52,789 --> 02:16:55,834
So is it your wife?

1745
02:16:56,918 --> 02:16:58,586
Put the gun down, Harvey.

1746
02:16:58,962 --> 02:17:00,630
Harvey, put down the gun.

1747
02:17:00,797 --> 02:17:04,342
Please. Please, Harvey. Please.

1748
02:17:05,719 --> 02:17:07,011
Oh, goddamn it.

1749
02:17:07,178 --> 02:17:09,347
Will you stop pointing that gun
at my family?

1750
02:17:09,848 --> 02:17:11,516
No!
We have a winner.

1751
02:17:11,683 --> 02:17:13,184
No, Jim, stop him!

1752
02:17:13,685 --> 02:17:15,520
Harvey.
Don't let him...

1753
02:17:15,687 --> 02:17:16,813
Harvey!

1754
02:17:18,189 --> 02:17:20,066
I'm sorry!

1755
02:17:21,860 --> 02:17:22,944
For everything.

1756
02:17:25,530 --> 02:17:27,741
Please don't hurt my son.

1757
02:17:37,876 --> 02:17:39,461
You brought your cops?

1758
02:17:39,627 --> 02:17:42,505
All they know is there's a situation.

1759
02:17:42,672 --> 02:17:45,675
They don't know who or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.

1760
02:17:45,842 --> 02:17:48,511
You think I wanna escape from this?

1761
02:17:48,678 --> 02:17:51,431
There is no escape from this.

1762
02:17:51,598 --> 02:17:53,725
You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey.

1763
02:17:56,019 --> 02:17:59,230
It's not about what I want,
it's about what's fair!

1764
02:17:59,981 --> 02:18:04,194
You thought we could be decent men
in an indecent time.

1765
02:18:06,988 --> 02:18:08,072
But you were wrong.

1766
02:18:08,782 --> 02:18:12,577
The world is cruel. And the only morality
in a cruel world...

1767
02:18:13,328 --> 02:18:15,246
is chance.

1768
02:18:15,413 --> 02:18:17,123
Unbiased.

1769
02:18:17,332 --> 02:18:18,583
Unprejudiced.

1770
02:18:19,959 --> 02:18:21,085
Fair.

1771
02:18:21,252 --> 02:18:23,505
His son's got the same chance she had.

1772
02:18:24,255 --> 02:18:25,548
Fifty-fifty.

1773
02:18:25,715 --> 02:18:29,177
What happened to Rachel wasn't chance.
We decided to act.

1774
02:18:29,511 --> 02:18:30,845
We three.

1775
02:18:31,012 --> 02:18:34,432
Then why was it me who was
the only one who lost everything?

1776
02:18:36,935 --> 02:18:39,562
It wasn't.
The Joker chose me.

1777
02:18:39,729 --> 02:18:42,023
Because you were the best of us.

1778
02:18:42,190 --> 02:18:47,195
He wanted to prove that
even someone as good as you...

1779
02:18:47,362 --> 02:18:49,113
could fall.

1780
02:18:49,447 --> 02:18:50,740
And he was right.

1781
02:18:50,907 --> 02:18:53,159
You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.

1782
02:18:53,326 --> 02:18:56,371
So point it at the people responsible.

1783
02:18:57,330 --> 02:18:59,165
Fair enough.

1784
02:19:02,502 --> 02:19:04,379
You first.

1785
02:19:16,891 --> 02:19:18,560
My turn.

1786
02:19:25,483 --> 02:19:27,485
Harvey, you're right.

1787
02:19:28,528 --> 02:19:31,155
Rachel's death was my fault.

1788
02:19:34,242 --> 02:19:36,703
Please don't punish the boy.

1789
02:19:37,787 --> 02:19:40,999
Please, punish me.
I'm about to.

1790
02:19:42,959 --> 02:19:44,919
Tell your boy
he's gonna be all right, Gordon.

1791
02:19:45,378 --> 02:19:47,005
Lie...

1792
02:19:47,505 --> 02:19:48,631
like I lied.

1793
02:19:52,385 --> 02:19:53,970
It's going to be all right, son.

1794
02:20:32,383 --> 02:20:35,219
Dad? Daddy, is he okay?

1795
02:20:51,736 --> 02:20:53,905
Thank you.
You don't have to thank me.

1796
02:20:54,530 --> 02:20:56,324
Yes, I do.

1797
02:21:00,578 --> 02:21:01,913
The Joker won.

1798
02:21:04,332 --> 02:21:07,210
Harvey's prosecution,
everything he fought for...

1799
02:21:07,752 --> 02:21:09,504
undone.

1800
02:21:10,004 --> 02:21:14,926
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with Harvey's reputation.

1801
02:21:15,093 --> 02:21:16,260
We bet it all on him.

1802
02:21:17,595 --> 02:21:20,473
The Joker took the best of us
and tore him down.

1803
02:21:21,057 --> 02:21:22,475
People will lose hope.

1804
02:21:22,642 --> 02:21:24,394
They won't.

1805
02:21:26,896 --> 02:21:28,773
They must never know what he did.

1806
02:21:28,940 --> 02:21:30,775
Five dead.

1807
02:21:31,067 --> 02:21:34,988
Two of them cops. You can't sweep that...
No.

1808
02:21:39,784 --> 02:21:42,620
But the Joker cannot win.

1809
02:21:47,875 --> 02:21:51,087
Gotham needs its true hero.

1810
02:21:57,468 --> 02:22:00,513
No.
You either die a hero...

1811
02:22:00,680 --> 02:22:05,143
or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

1812
02:22:05,309 --> 02:22:07,145
I can do those things...

1813
02:22:07,562 --> 02:22:10,606
because I'm not a hero, not like Dent.

1814
02:22:13,609 --> 02:22:16,487
I killed those people.
That's what I can be.

1815
02:22:16,654 --> 02:22:18,573
No, no, you can't. You're not.

1816
02:22:18,740 --> 02:22:21,325
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.

1817
02:22:22,994 --> 02:22:24,120
Call it in.

1818
02:22:27,415 --> 02:22:29,167
A hero.

1819
02:22:29,333 --> 02:22:32,587
Not the hero we deserved,
but the hero we needed.

1820
02:22:33,171 --> 02:22:35,715
Nothing less than a knight...

1821
02:22:36,257 --> 02:22:37,967
shining.

1822
02:22:38,593 --> 02:22:40,219
<i>They'll hunt you.</i>

1823
02:22:40,386 --> 02:22:42,180
<i>You'll hunt me.</i>

1824
02:22:42,680 --> 02:22:44,640
<i>You'll condemn me.</i>

1825
02:22:45,349 --> 02:22:47,643
<i>Set the dogs on me.</i>

1826
02:22:51,397 --> 02:22:53,691
<i>Because that's what needs to happen.</i>

1827
02:22:54,859 --> 02:22:56,778
<i>Because sometimes...</i>

1828
02:22:56,944 --> 02:22:59,113
<i>the truth isn't good enough.</i>

1829
02:22:59,989 --> 02:23:02,283
<i>Sometimes people deserve more.</i>

1830
02:23:05,745 --> 02:23:09,665
<i>Sometimes people deserve
to have their faith rewarded.</i>

1831
02:23:28,059 --> 02:23:29,727
Batman.

1832
02:23:31,646 --> 02:23:33,397
Batman!

1833
02:23:34,190 --> 02:23:36,150
Why's he running, Dad?

1834
02:23:37,193 --> 02:23:38,528
Because we have to chase him.

1835
02:23:38,694 --> 02:23:41,572
Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!

1836
02:23:47,662 --> 02:23:49,247
He didn't do anything wrong.

1837
02:23:51,999 --> 02:23:57,588
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.

1838
02:23:59,006 --> 02:24:00,049
<i>So we'll hunt him...</i>

1839
02:24:03,177 --> 02:24:05,263
<i>because he can take it.</i>

1840
02:24:07,765 --> 02:24:10,268
<i>Because he's not a hero.</i>

1841
02:24:17,817 --> 02:24:19,026
<i>He's a silent guardian...</i>

1842
02:24:20,194 --> 02:24:22,071
a watchful protector.

1843
02:24:24,574 --> 02:24:25,867
<i>A dark knight.</i>

1844
02:24:34,574 --> 02:24:40,574
<i>Thank you for using the subs</i>
<i>       regards, shock...</i>
