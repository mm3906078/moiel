- It was a dog.

- Huh?
- It was a big dog.

There were more copycats last night,

You know, as our new DA, you might wanna
figure out where your jurisdiction ends.

286
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:22,097
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante.

287
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:25,642
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary citizen
standing up for what's right.

288
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,061
Gotham needs heroes like you,
elected officials...

289
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:31,523
- ...not a man who thinks he's above the law.
- Who appointed the Batman?

290
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,527
We did. All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city.

When their enemies were at the gates...

and appoint one man to protect the city.

294
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,996
It wasn't considered an honor,
it was a public service.

295
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:50,292
Harvey, the last man that they appointed to
protect the republic was named Caesar...

296
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:53,879
- ...and he never gave up his power.
- Okay, fine.

297
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,380
You either die a hero...

298

wanna do this for the rest of his life.

someone to take up his mantle.

is the Caped Crusader? Hm?

- Yeah.
- Now, there is a tradeoff.

424
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:25,496
Separation of the plates makes you

429
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:39,135
I found one in Arizona.

430
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:43,473
A very nice man said he could have it up
and running in a week, and he takes cash.

431
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,476
- What about the flight crew?
- South Korean smugglers.

432
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:48,853
They run flights into Pyongyang,
below radar.

433
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,773
- Did you think of an alibi?
- Oh, yes.

434
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:13,169
I believe this is your plane, sir.

435
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:20,885
You look tired, Alfred.
You'll be all right without me'?

436
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:26,057
If you can tell me the Russian for
"apply your own bloody suntan lotion."

437
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:41,030
Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.

438
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:43,032
<font color="#808080">BODYGUARD :</font>

439
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,926

441

You wanna know how I got these scars?

442
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,983
My father was...

443
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,609
...a drinker...

444
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,028
...and a fiend.

445
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:25,033
And one night,
he goes off crazier than usual.

446
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,244
Mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself.

447
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:29,954
He doesn't like that...

448
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:33,583
...not one bit.

449
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,294
So, me watching...

450
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:41,049
...he takes the knife to her,
laughing while he does it.

451
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:44,302
He turns to me and he says:

452
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:48,139
"Why so serious?"

453
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:49,974
He comes at me with the knife.

454
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,560
"Why so serious?"

455
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:57,690
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

456
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:01,944
"Let's put a smile on that face."

457
00:31:03,154 --> 00:31:05,365
And...

458
00:31:07,742 --> 00:31:09,285
Why so serious?

459
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:15,833
Now...

460
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,252
...our operation is small...

461
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:21,339
...but there is a lot of potential...

462
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:24,050
...for aggressive expansion.

463
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:27,428
So which of you fine gentlemen
would like to join our team?

464
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:32,016
Oh. There's only one spot open right now,
so we're gonna have...

465
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,852

I must apologize for leaving Gotham
in the middle of our negotiations.

- ...I couldn't let it threaten my company.
- Of course.

...with you here now, we can continue.

I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone call
might have sufficed.

486
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:04,817
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think
he was deliberately wasting your time.

487
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,611
Just accidentally wasting it.

That's very good, Mr. Lau.
"Accidentally." Very good.

Hey, sir.

There's a better view from the peak tram.

How's the view from LSI Holdings?

Restricted.

493
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:40,144
Lau is holed up in there good and tight.

494
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:42,230

- I had R & D work it up.

Charge them with what?

In a RICO case, if you can charge
one of them with a felony...

"The guy from those God-awful

- All three.

653

The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.

726
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:19,744
One day they carve her face.

727
00:51:20,245 --> 00:51:24,499
And we have no money for surgeries.
She can't take it.

728
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:28,378
I just wanna see her smile again. Hm'?

729
00:51:28,712 --> 00:51:31,631
I just want her to know
that I don't care about the scars.

A long time ago, I was in Burma...

771
00:54:20,884 --> 00:54:24,304
...and my friends and I were working
for the local government.

772
00:54:24,471 --> 00:54:27,056
They were trying to buy
the loyalty of tribal leaders...

773
00:54:27,223 --> 00:54:30,059
...by bribing them with precious stones...

774
00:54:30,226 --> 00:54:34,814
...but their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.

775
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:38,276
So we went looking for the stones.

776
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:43,782
But in six months, we never
met anyone who traded with him.

One day, I saw a child

00:54:48,578 --> 00:54:51,623
...the size of a tangerine.

779
00:54:51,873 --> 00:54:55,251
The bandit had been
throwing them away.

780
00:54:55,919 --> 00:54:58,630
- So why steal them?
- Because he thought it was good sport.

781
00:54:58,797 --> 00:55:03,760
Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical, like money.

You honestly think that's gonna
keep the Joker from killing people?

Maybe not. But I have enough blood
on my hands.

They'll hate you for it,
but that's the point of Batman.

976

He can be the outcast. He can make
the choice that no one else can make.

977

01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,846
Secondly, because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in.

992
01:11:06,013 --> 01:11:07,723
<i>But let's consider the situation.</i>

993
01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:10,726
Should we give in
to this terrorist's demands?

994
01:11:10,893 --> 01:11:12,352
Do we really think he's gonna...?

995
01:11:12,519 --> 01:11:15,898
You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante
than the lives of citizens?

996
01:11:16,064 --> 01:11:18,442
The Batman is an outlaw.

997
01:11:19,318 --> 01:11:23,071
That's not why we demand he turn himself
in, we're doing it because we're scared.

998
01:11:23,238 --> 01:11:26,033
We've been happy to let Batman
clean up our streets till now.

1004
01:11:44,843 --> 01:11:49,389
One day, the Batman will have to answer
for the laws he's broken. But to us...
