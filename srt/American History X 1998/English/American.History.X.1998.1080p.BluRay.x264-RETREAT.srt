1
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,196
Derek.

2
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:09,823
Derek.

3
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:13,201
- Fucking pervert, Dan.
- Jesus, what the fuck are you thinking?

4
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:16,204
There's a black guy outside.
He's breaking into your car.

5
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:20,000
- How long's he been there?
- I don't know.

6
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:22,544
- What's going on?
- Not right now, honey. How many?

7
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,381
- Danny, how many?
- One, I think.

8
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:28,467
- Is he strapped?
- Huh?

9
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:31,636
- Does he have a fucking gun, Danny?
- Man, I don't fucking know.

10
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,724
Wait a second.
What the fuck is going on, Derek?

11
00:04:35,892 --> 00:04:37,642
- Stay right here and be quiet.
- Jesus.

12
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,562
- Stay right here.
- Wait a second, Derek. Wait.

13
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,189
Derek.

14
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,942
Shh, shh, shh.

15
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,611
They're right here.

16
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:30,839
I don't have a personal problem
with him, okay?

17
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:33,550
Don't insult my intelligence, Murray.

18
00:06:33,718 --> 00:06:36,511
You hate this child
and I think I know why.

19
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:46,229
I went out with his mother a few times.

20
00:06:46,397 --> 00:06:48,523
That was three years ago. It was nothing.

21
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:50,025
Nothing. Really? Hmm.

22
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:53,320
That paper, Bob, it's a travesty.

23
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:56,364
Arguing for Hitler as a civil-rights hero?

24
00:06:56,532 --> 00:06:57,949
You've gotta draw the line.

25
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:00,201
Murray, you actually did this to yourself.

26
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:02,829
You told them they could
do a report on any book...

27
00:07:02,997 --> 00:07:06,207
that related to the struggle
for civil rights. In plain English.

28
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,047
I am not disputing the fact that the child
is confused and harbors some sick ideas...

29
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:14,841
but I am not ready
to give up on him yet.

30
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,636
His brother probably put him up to it.

31
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:21,806
I can guarantee you 100 percent
his brother did not put him up to this.

32
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,309
I find that hard to believe. Whatever.

33
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,562
I know he was a good kid
and it's a shame what he's been through...

34
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,981
- ...but that is dangerous.
- Dangerous in what way?

35
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:32,817
Bob, that goes too far.

36
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:36,613
This racist propaganda,
this Mein Kampf psychobabble?

37
00:07:36,781 --> 00:07:39,699
He learned this nonsense, Murray,
and he can unlearn it too.

38
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:42,535
I will not give up on this child yet.

39
00:08:00,638 --> 00:08:03,223
- I knew it was you.
- Danny, get in here.

40
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:07,435
I said, get in here. Get in here!

41
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:09,229
Five, four, three...

42
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,190
two... Shut the door.

43
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:16,903
What's it gonna be, Danny?

44
00:08:18,072 --> 00:08:19,364
What's what gonna be?

45
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,950
This petty crap you're pulling.

46
00:08:23,911 --> 00:08:24,953
I don't know.

47
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:26,663
Have a seat.

48
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:34,754
How you doing?

49
00:08:36,632 --> 00:08:38,383
Fine.

50
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:40,802
Things at home okay?

51
00:08:41,846 --> 00:08:43,179
Yeah.

52
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,476
Derek got out this morning, did he not?

53
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:52,480
Yeah, he did.

54
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:55,984
He was one of my students.
You knew that, right?

55
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:59,821
Honors English.
He was a brilliant student.

56
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:04,159
Like you. But he hung out
with simple-minded fools.

57
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:06,494
- Heh-heh-heh.
- Also like you.

58
00:09:06,662 --> 00:09:09,122
Look, did you bring me in here
to talk about Derek?

59
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,499
Because what happened to him
has nothing to do with me.

60
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:15,170
Everything you do right now
has something to do with Derek.

61
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:17,922
Look, I followed directions
and I wrote an A paper.

62
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,176
"Mein Kampf"?

63
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:24,679
- I should expel you.
- Go ahead.

64
00:09:24,847 --> 00:09:28,850
- You don't think I could handle it?
- No, I think the street would kill you.

65
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:32,687
Your rhetoric and your propaganda
aren't gonna save you out there.

66
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:36,107
So here's the drill.

67
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:38,818
I'm your history teacher from now on.

68
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:42,530
We will discuss current events.

69
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:45,116
We will call this class...

70
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:49,037
American History X.

71
00:09:49,914 --> 00:09:52,040
We meet once a day.

72
00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:56,878
All right, your first assignment is to
prepare for me a new paper due tomorrow.

73
00:09:57,046 --> 00:10:00,673
Oh, come on. It took me a week
to read Mein Kampf. That isn't fair.

74
00:10:11,185 --> 00:10:13,645
- What do you want me to do it on?
- Your brother.

75
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,065
Oh, God, man.
Please tell me you're joking.

76
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:19,400
No, no, no. I'm not kidding.

77
00:10:20,236 --> 00:10:24,906
I want you to analyze and interpret all the
events surrounding Derek's incarceration.

78
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:28,701
How these events helped shape
your present perspective...

79
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:32,288
concerning life
in contemporary America.

80
00:10:32,456 --> 00:10:34,207
The impact on your life.

81
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,459
Your family's.

82
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,130
Whatever you wanna say, Danny...

83
00:10:44,301 --> 00:10:46,594
I'll be the only one reading it.

84
00:10:48,138 --> 00:10:50,265
But if it's not on my desk...

85
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:52,225
tomorrow morning...

86
00:10:52,977 --> 00:10:56,271
you are a ghost at Venice Beach High.

87
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:59,440
Are you clear?

88
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:02,402
Yeah, I'm clear.

89
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:09,450
Telling teacher I'm fucking cheating?

90
00:11:09,618 --> 00:11:11,744
Is that what's happening?

91
00:11:11,912 --> 00:11:15,039
- I never cheated in my life.
- Beat his motherfucking ass, Henry.

92
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,959
- I didn't say anything.
- Why you tripping on me?

93
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:22,964
Why you all kicking him like that?

94
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:24,799
What's up, man?

95
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,136
What you scared for?
I ain't gonna do nothing.

96
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,186
What's up?

97
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:41,482
Want some too, bitch?
Punk. What's wrong with you?

98
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,443
You wanna die?

99
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,738
Punk-ass white boy.

100
00:11:53,495 --> 00:11:56,497
You lucky I gotta go to class.
He ain't gonna do nothing.

101
00:11:56,665 --> 00:11:59,542
He don't wanna see me and the heater.

102
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:04,339
Lucky the bell rung.
I would have clocked that white boy.

103
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:05,965
Punk-ass motherfucker.

104
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:07,175
We'd smoke that fool.

105
00:12:08,636 --> 00:12:10,678
You gotta fucking stand up for yourself.

106
00:12:26,487 --> 00:12:28,404
We got a whole file on skinheads.

107
00:12:28,572 --> 00:12:31,532
- These all part of the same gang?
- Venice Beach Gang.

108
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,118
- Where's my buddy?
- He's doing a stretch at YA.

109
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,621
- This guy C.C.?
- Mm-hm.

110
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,374
- That him?
- Yeah, that's him right there.

111
00:12:41,377 --> 00:12:44,545
This morning we have a guest coming in,
and there he is.

112
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:46,756
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.

113
00:12:46,924 --> 00:12:48,549
- Good to see you, pal.
- Morning.

114
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:50,843
Gentlemen, this here is Dr. Bob Sweeney.

115
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:53,388
He's principal over at Venice Beach High.

116
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:58,309
He's been doing outreach work with gangs,
both in and out of the can.

117
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,979
Three years ago,
a local kid named Derek Vinyard...

118
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:04,649
was sent up for murdering two Crips
who were trying to jack his car.

119
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:09,237
Bob taught Vinyard back in high school
and he's followed the case closely.

120
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:12,031
He was a skinhead, right?

121
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:16,369
He was more like the skinhead.
The protégé of Cameron Alexander.

122
00:13:16,537 --> 00:13:19,247
- Who?
- Cameron Alexander.

123
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:21,582
Here you go. Have a look-see.

124
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:23,918
Cameron Alexander, well...

125
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:25,670
he's a Venice Beach landmark.

126
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:29,424
He's probably the biggest distributor
of white-power literature and videos...

127
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:30,675
in L.A. County.

128
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,344
He promotes white-power bands.
He writes reviews.

129
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,431
And, uh, in his spare time
this guy even writes hate columns.

130
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:37,890
Does he have a record?

131
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:39,267
He's pretty clean.

132
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:42,061
Been trying to pin something to him,
but it doesn't work.

133
00:13:42,229 --> 00:13:44,939
Trust me. He's behind all of it.

134
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:47,400
He runs everything out of his house
down by the beach.

135
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:49,610
No white gangs in Venice Beach...

136
00:13:49,778 --> 00:13:52,113
before Cameron Alexander
and Derek Vinyard hooked up.

137
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:55,283
Alexander found in Derek
his shining prince.

138
00:13:55,451 --> 00:13:59,454
Essentially, he used Derek
to recruit a slew of insecure...

139
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:01,622
frustrated and impressionable kids.

140
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,460
This kid Vinyard, well,
he's got a lot of baggage...

141
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:09,589
as you'll see in this tape
that we've gotten courtesy of NBC.

142
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,223
L.A. County firefighter Dennis Vinyard...

143
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,894
was shot and killed battling a blaze
at a suspected Compton drug den.

144
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,812
We're at the Vinyard home right now...

145
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,983
and Lieutenant Vinyard's oldest son,
Derek, has agreed to talk with us.

146
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:32,945
Derek, if you could come down here,
please, for just a second.

147
00:14:33,113 --> 00:14:36,991
Look, I know this is tough,
but, um, how do you feel right now?

148
00:14:37,826 --> 00:14:39,660
How do you think I feel?

149
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:44,040
- I think it's typical.
- Typical, how?

150
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:47,919
This country's becoming a haven
for criminals, so, what do you expect?

151
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,338
Decent, hardworking Americans
like my dad...

152
00:14:50,506 --> 00:14:53,591
are getting rubbed out
by social parasites.

153
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,426
Parasites?

154
00:14:55,969 --> 00:14:59,097
Blacks, browns, yellow, whatever.

155
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:00,389
I don't understand.

156
00:15:00,557 --> 00:15:02,683
You're saying your father's murder
was race-related?

157
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:04,685
Yeah, it's race-related.

158
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:08,481
Every problem in this country
is race-related, not just crime.

159
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:12,401
Immigration, AIDS, welfare. Those are
problems of the black community...

160
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:15,530
the Hispanic community,
Asian community. Not white problems.

161
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:17,698
Aren't those issues
that deal more with poverty?

162
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:21,786
No. They're not products of their
environments, either. That's crap.

163
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,163
Minorities don't give two shits
about this country.

164
00:15:24,331 --> 00:15:26,749
They come here to exploit it,
not to embrace it.

165
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:30,169
Millions of white European-Americans
came here and flourished.

166
00:15:30,337 --> 00:15:33,381
Within a generation. What the fuck
is the matter with these people?

167
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:36,134
They have to go around
shooting at firemen.

168
00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:41,430
- What does this have to do with your father?
- My father was murdered doing his job.

169
00:15:41,598 --> 00:15:43,724
Putting out a fire
in a nigger neighborhood...

170
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:45,726
he shouldn't have given
a shit about.

171
00:15:45,894 --> 00:15:49,564
He got shot by a fucking drug dealer
who probably collects a welfare check.

172
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:51,524
- That's enough.
- I'm sorry.

173
00:15:51,692 --> 00:15:54,569
Derek Vinyard was released
from Chino earlier this morning...

174
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:56,946
after serving three and some-odd years.

175
00:15:57,114 --> 00:15:59,657
I think this is something
we gotta keep an eye on.

176
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,617
If something happens to him...

177
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:04,245
things could get very ugly
down by the beach.

178
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:05,663
Just keep it low.

179
00:16:07,207 --> 00:16:10,084
Venice Beach didn't always look like this.

180
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:12,670
It used to be a great neighborhood.

181
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,672
The boardwalk's always been a dump...

182
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,716
but when my dad moved us out here...

183
00:16:16,884 --> 00:16:19,385
Venice was a nice, quiet place
to grow up.

184
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,015
Over the years, though,
it's just gone to hell.

185
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,267
The gangs are like a plague.

186
00:16:26,435 --> 00:16:29,145
They moved west from Inglewood
and South Central...

187
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:30,730
and basically took over.

188
00:16:30,898 --> 00:16:33,191
It ain't fouling you.
What's wrong with you?

189
00:16:36,445 --> 00:16:37,695
Fuck all y'all.

190
00:16:38,822 --> 00:16:41,782
I ain't got time for all the bullshit.

191
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:43,784
Fuck y'all.

192
00:16:43,952 --> 00:16:46,245
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

193
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:50,499
Yo, is that that fool
you was telling me about?

194
00:16:51,418 --> 00:16:53,127
Yeah, that's that motherfucker.

195
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:00,760
Yeah, man, that's him.

196
00:17:10,312 --> 00:17:11,646
Bitch-ass motherfucker.

197
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:13,981
That's why Derek started the D.O.C.

198
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:18,486
He said white kids shouldn't have to walk
around scared in their own neighborhood.

199
00:17:18,654 --> 00:17:22,573
For a while there, he really made it
like it was ours again.

200
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:25,159
- Throw the ball. Throw the ball.
- Come on, Seth. Block.

201
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:29,163
Come on, Curtis. Quit chucking it up.
Pass the ball.

202
00:17:29,331 --> 00:17:31,666
- Pass that thing.
- D up.

203
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,834
- Here we go.
- Come on, let's go. Let's go.

204
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:35,044
Come on.

205
00:17:35,212 --> 00:17:39,340
Look at this fucking jungle bunny. He
does a spin move every time. Every time.

206
00:17:40,676 --> 00:17:44,303
- You ain't getting shit, motherfucker.
- Over here. Over here.

207
00:17:44,471 --> 00:17:45,846
This one's for you, boy!

208
00:17:46,682 --> 00:17:49,016
- Fuck you...?
- Stop that.

209
00:17:49,184 --> 00:17:50,643
Who you calling a boy, motherfucker?

210
00:17:50,811 --> 00:17:54,105
You lucky motherfucker! I'm through
monkeying around with your ass!

211
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,732
You pale, pastrami-eating,
cracker motherfucker...

212
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,859
a hundred bucks say
I make you my bitch.

213
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:05,866
Hear that? He's trying to make ends meet
for his cut in welfare. You're fucking on!

214
00:18:07,828 --> 00:18:11,038
- It's 8-6, Seth.
- When I want your opinion, I'll ask for it.

215
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:13,708
Come on, guys, I can't cover this.
Help me out here.

216
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:17,211
- You have a big fucking mouth, Seth.
- I can take this niglet down.

217
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:19,797
You can't take a shit.
The fuck are you thinking?

218
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,717
- I will beat him. Give me the money.
- Shut up. Shut up.

219
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:25,136
You're gonna fucking embarrass us.
Shut up!

220
00:18:33,228 --> 00:18:34,645
I'll take care of this.

221
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:37,815
Hey.

222
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,235
I got a bet.

223
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:46,991
I come in this game right now. Same score,
but we play black guys against white guys.

224
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,244
Motherfucker.

225
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:52,330
Oh, shit.

226
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:54,373
Name your price, cracker.

227
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,709
No money. No money. For these courts.

228
00:18:56,877 --> 00:18:58,669
And not just today. For good.

229
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:03,049
If you win, we will walk away.
But if we win...

230
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:05,343
no bitching, no fighting...

231
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,430
here in front of everybody, pack your
shit and get your black asses out of here.

232
00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:11,515
Man, fuck that. Take this bet, man.

233
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,059
Eight to six, our ball.

234
00:19:14,102 --> 00:19:16,187
Let's go.

235
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,453
Pick him up. Pick him up.

236
00:19:39,127 --> 00:19:40,753
Seth, get back and play some D!

237
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:42,713
Come on, Seth.

238
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,634
Come on, let's go.

239
00:19:56,144 --> 00:19:57,603
All right. Defense!

240
00:20:04,611 --> 00:20:06,112
All right.

241
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,489
Pass the fucking ball, I was wide open.

242
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,702
Damn!

243
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:16,080
Let's go. Let's go, yo. Let's go.

244
00:20:16,623 --> 00:20:17,915
Pick, pick, Derek!

245
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:25,256
Bullshit! That's offense.

246
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,634
- Get out of here. He moved his feet.
- If you want to go, I'm ready!

247
00:20:28,802 --> 00:20:30,261
- Don't throw elbows!
- Want to go?

248
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,513
Adolf Hitler-wannabe motherfucker?
What?

249
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:36,016
Kill that motherfucker! Dead!

250
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:37,852
Chill out, bro. Chill out.

251
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:41,355
- Wait, it's cool. It's cool.
- Relax.

252
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,444
- You okay?
- Yeah. Just give me some water.

253
00:20:46,611 --> 00:20:50,364
- You gotta call offense on that shit, Der.
- Not on game point, Danny.

254
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:52,658
You can't let niggers
get away with that shit.

255
00:20:52,826 --> 00:20:56,620
- Honey, it's game point.
- Shut them down, Derek. Kick some ass.

256
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,372
Watch this.

257
00:21:28,904 --> 00:21:30,905
Get that ball.

258
00:21:31,072 --> 00:21:33,324
Pass the ball, baby. Pass the ball.

259
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:40,998
Yeah!

260
00:21:51,718 --> 00:21:52,760
Bye-bye.

261
00:21:52,928 --> 00:21:54,762
Get the fuck off my court.

262
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,181
- This is my house.
- Fuck you, bitch.

263
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,229
- What happened?
- I dropped the ball!

264
00:22:03,396 --> 00:22:04,438
Yeah!

265
00:22:09,611 --> 00:22:13,948
Get the fuck out of here!
This is my court! Yes!

266
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,372
Yeah.

267
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:26,085
Derek wouldn't let us visit him in prison.

268
00:22:26,253 --> 00:22:28,295
He said it would make it
too hard for him...

269
00:22:28,463 --> 00:22:31,632
and that if we came,
he wouldn't see us anyhow.

270
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,052
Three years without him,
just wondering...

271
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,974
and then at 7:00 this morning...

272
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:42,726
we picked him up outside the gate.

273
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:47,773
- Come on, Danny.
- Der.

274
00:22:48,817 --> 00:22:51,443
The whole ride back,
he didn't say anything.

275
00:22:51,611 --> 00:22:56,156
I wanted to stay home, but he said,
"No, go to school. I'll see you later."

276
00:23:09,462 --> 00:23:11,964
Oh, come on. Give the guy a break.

277
00:23:12,132 --> 00:23:14,341
What's the matter?
You too big to give me a hug?

278
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:15,551
No, man.

279
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:19,763
I just know you'll need someone to look after
you while you adjust to all this space.

280
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,265
Yeah, right.

281
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:25,019
This place is smaller
than the old living room.

282
00:23:25,186 --> 00:23:27,521
- How you doing? How's school?
- It's good. It's good.

283
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:30,691
You gotta do something about that hair.
That 'do has gotta go.

284
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:33,986
- I don't know. The girls like it, so...
- Well, I don't.

285
00:23:34,154 --> 00:23:36,405
You're keeping it pretty close.
All the way down, huh?

286
00:23:36,573 --> 00:23:38,115
Yeah.

287
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,160
Shit, look, I forgot, man.

288
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:45,372
- It hurt like shit while they put it on.
- When did you get that?

289
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,916
I got it about a month ago.

290
00:23:48,084 --> 00:23:49,501
Cameron made it official.

291
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:52,671
- Cameron?
- Yeah.

292
00:23:54,382 --> 00:23:56,884
- He put this on you?
- Mm-hm. Yeah.

293
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,556
- Hello?
- What?

294
00:24:02,724 --> 00:24:04,224
Hi. Just hang on a second.

295
00:24:04,392 --> 00:24:06,477
Derek, it's for you.

296
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,021
Nothing. Nothing.

297
00:24:09,189 --> 00:24:10,606
- There a phone in the back?
- Mm-hm.

298
00:24:10,774 --> 00:24:12,441
I'll get it in the back.

299
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:21,784
I got it.

300
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,244
Yeah? Oh, hey.

301
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:28,374
What?

302
00:24:30,627 --> 00:24:33,253

You think our friend was behind that?

307
00:24:52,232 --> 00:24:53,774
You know what? I don't even care.

308
00:24:53,942 --> 00:24:55,734
I'm gonna take care of that tonight.

309
00:24:55,902 --> 00:24:57,236
Mwah.

310
00:24:57,445 --> 00:24:59,446
My sweet kid. My baby boy.

00:25:08,665 --> 00:25:11,291
No, he'll do it.
He'll do it. I'll make sure he does it.

313
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:13,794
I'll get it.

314
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:23,137
- Came to see the man.
- Can you fit through the door?

315
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:24,805
Fuck you!

316
00:25:26,307 --> 00:25:28,392
- Seth.
- What's up, Dan?

317
00:25:28,977 --> 00:25:30,519
How you doing? Where's Derek?

318
00:25:30,687 --> 00:25:31,729
He's on the phone.

319
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:35,274
Come out, you free motherfucker!
Vinyard, where the fuck are you?

320
00:25:35,442 --> 00:25:37,109
- Vinyard!
- Hang on.

321
00:25:37,277 --> 00:25:39,319
- Give me a minute.
- Vinyard!

322
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:41,780
No, I'll be out in a minute.

323
00:25:56,796 --> 00:26:01,175
I'm being careful. What am I gonna do? I
won't stay in my room the rest of my life.

324
00:26:02,218 --> 00:26:03,427
Hold on.

325
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:06,764
Hey. Hey. What the fuck
is Seth doing here?

326
00:26:07,182 --> 00:26:09,141
Did you invite him over?

327
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:11,935
No, he always comes over here.

328
00:26:12,645 --> 00:26:14,855
All right. Danny, give me a minute.

329
00:26:15,982 --> 00:26:18,150
Just give me one minute.

330
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,119
Yeah.

331
00:26:37,086 --> 00:26:38,796
God, are you still here, Goodyear?

332
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,966
You calling me a blimp,
you fucking Democrat?

333
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:47,554
When was the last time
you were able to see your feet?

334
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:51,975
Come in here, Danny.

335
00:26:53,603 --> 00:26:55,562
Seth.

336
00:26:56,731 --> 00:26:58,816
Hey, man,
you going to Cam's party tonight?

337
00:26:58,983 --> 00:27:00,901
Is Davina's ass watertight?

338
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:03,362
You're fucking sick, man.

339
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:06,406
All right, relax.
Let me ask you a few questions.

340
00:27:06,574 --> 00:27:09,493
I'm not in the mood.
I got homework to do.

341
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:13,247
Tell me some of the shit you've learned,
fuck-ass, before I pistol-whip you.

342
00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:18,585
Okay. I believe in death, destruction,
chaos, filth and greed.

343
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:22,422
Cut the shit, Dan. Come on.
Tell me what I wanna hear, asshole.

344
00:27:24,133 --> 00:27:28,428
- You mean that shit about your mother?
- You wanna get fucking beaten, Danny?

345
00:27:30,223 --> 00:27:33,433
I'm not fucking talking to you, Davina.
Why don't you shut up?

346
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:36,645
Look, you got to let me do this
my own way, all right?

347
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:39,606
I'll take care of it.

348
00:27:39,774 --> 00:27:41,817
Who do you hate, Danny?

349
00:27:41,985 --> 00:27:44,695
I hate anyone that isn't white Protestant.

350
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,071
Why?

351
00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:48,740
They're a burden to the advancement
of the white race.

352
00:27:48,908 --> 00:27:53,245
- Some of them are all right, I guess.
- None of them are fucking all right, Danny.

353
00:27:53,413 --> 00:27:56,081
They're all fucking freeloaders.
Remember what Cam said?

354
00:27:56,249 --> 00:28:00,085
"We don't know them. We don't wanna
know them. They're the fucking enemy."

355
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,257
What don't you like about them?
And say it with some fucking conviction.

356
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:08,552
I hate the fact that it's cool
to be black these days.

357
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,221
- Good.
- I hate this hip-hop...

358
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,807
fucking influence
on white fucking suburbia.

359
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:16,810
- Good.
- And I hate Tabitha Soren...

360
00:28:16,978 --> 00:28:19,354
and all her Zionist MTV fucking pigs...

361
00:28:19,522 --> 00:28:21,231
telling us we should get along.

362
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:24,109
Save the rhetorical bullshit,
Hillary Rodham Clinton...

363
00:28:24,277 --> 00:28:26,153
because it ain't gonna fucking happen.

364
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:28,989
That's the best shit I've heard
come out of your mouth.

365
00:28:29,157 --> 00:28:31,825
Danny, no. I feel sorry for you, Danny.

366
00:28:31,993 --> 00:28:33,410
I know you don't believe that.

367
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,913
- Shut up, Davina!
- No, you shut the fuck up!

368
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,665
Get out of the house, you piece of shit!
Please go.

369
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,626
Is that any way to talk to a guest?

370
00:28:40,793 --> 00:28:41,877
A friend of the family?

371
00:28:42,045 --> 00:28:45,797
- Derek hates you and you don't realize it.
- Hey, how do you know who I hate?

372
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:47,966
Fucking A. Back from the dead.

373
00:28:48,134 --> 00:28:50,636
God bless Jesus Christ, man.

374
00:28:50,803 --> 00:28:54,431
I think you lost weight, man. I can get
my arms almost all the way around you.

375
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,685
Fifty fucking pounds, man.
Jesus, look at this hair. Holy shit.

376
00:28:58,853 --> 00:29:01,855
- Yeah, I told him it's gotta go.
- It's good to have you back.

377
00:29:02,023 --> 00:29:04,524
Grab your jacket,
let's get the fuck out of here.

378
00:29:04,692 --> 00:29:06,860
All right. I wanna talk to him one second.

379
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:08,195
Look...

380
00:29:08,488 --> 00:29:10,614
Hey, uh, listen...

381
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,866
did you pull some shit
in school today?

382
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:16,370
- No, just the usual.
- I'm telling you, man, this kid is awesome.

383
00:29:17,121 --> 00:29:20,040
- Did you turn in a paper on Mein Kampf?
- Yeah.

384
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:21,416
- Awesome.
- You should've...

385
00:29:21,584 --> 00:29:23,961
- Sweeney probably shit his pants.
- He did, man.

386
00:29:24,128 --> 00:29:26,838
Did Cameron put you up to that?
Did he tell you to do that?

387
00:29:27,006 --> 00:29:30,175
No, man, I thought it would be cool.
How'd you know, though?

388
00:29:30,343 --> 00:29:32,052
- How'd you know?
- Doesn't matter how.

389
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,388
This kid is smart as hell.

390
00:29:35,056 --> 00:29:36,473
Was that Sweeney on the phone?

391
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:38,350
Yeah, Sweeney called.

392
00:29:38,518 --> 00:29:40,352
What are you talking to Sweeney for?

393
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,813
- Relax. Listen.
- He's got to get a fucking life.

394
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,732
- He pisses me off.
- Sweeney's a good teacher, all right?

395
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,527
Sweeney is a nigger on a power trip,
Vinyard.

396
00:29:48,695 --> 00:29:50,779
That's what he was like
when we were there.

397
00:29:50,947 --> 00:29:53,865
- And it'll never change. Fuck that nigger!
- Hey, Seth.

398
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:56,576
- Seth, go away. Go away.
- What? Are you kidding?

399
00:29:56,744 --> 00:30:00,122
Go wait in Danny's room. I wanna
talk to my brother. I'm glad to see you.

400
00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:02,833
- I'll be there in one minute.
- Hurry up. I'm starving.

401
00:30:07,255 --> 00:30:09,006
Come here. Seriously, look...

402
00:30:09,173 --> 00:30:12,759
Forget this yahoo. He kills bugs for a
living. You don't wanna be like that.

403
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:14,928
I'm serious. It's not funny.

404
00:30:15,096 --> 00:30:17,222
Sweeney is a good teacher.
You can learn from him.

405
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,599
So don't fuck it up
with small-fry shit like that.

406
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:21,268
You got to be smarter than that.

407
00:30:21,436 --> 00:30:24,104
You gotta see the bullshit paper
he's making me write.

408
00:30:24,272 --> 00:30:26,732
I know about it. He told me about it.
I don't care.

409
00:30:26,899 --> 00:30:29,443
Do it. You do anything he tells
you to do. I mean it.

410
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:32,487
I don't want you in trouble in school,
trying to impress me...

411
00:30:32,655 --> 00:30:34,906
taking this shit in there, all right?

412
00:30:35,074 --> 00:30:36,742
Do you understand what I'm saying?

413
00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:39,286
I guess, but I was doing it
because I thought you'd be happy.

414
00:30:40,788 --> 00:30:42,581
Well, I'm not.

415
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:46,418
Shit. Listen to that.

416
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:48,962
Yeah, I know. It's been getting worse.

417
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:52,799
All right, don't worry about it.
I'll talk to you about this later.

418
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:54,634
- Okay.
- Later.

419
00:30:56,095 --> 00:30:59,681
She's coughing her lungs out and you're
blowing this shit in her face all day.

420
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:01,349
- Put it out.
- I'm putting it out.

421
00:31:01,517 --> 00:31:02,642
All right. Come on.

422
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:05,896
Hey. Come on, I wanna talk to you.

423
00:31:09,776 --> 00:31:12,903
Mommy, are you okay?

424
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,452
What are you doing? Put that out.

425
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,663
I'm yelling at him for blowing smoke
and you're here sucking on it.

426
00:31:23,831 --> 00:31:25,624
Nice thing to come home to, huh?

427
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:27,375
Yeah.

428
00:31:28,503 --> 00:31:31,963
You all right?

429
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:39,596
Look...

430
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:42,265
you gotta take it easy.
You gotta get some rest.

431
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:45,685
I want you to take Danny's and my room
and we'll hit the couch.

432
00:31:45,853 --> 00:31:49,397
- Couch is fine for now.
- No, it's not fine. It's not. This is terrible.

433
00:31:49,565 --> 00:31:51,525
We can't live like this.

434
00:31:51,901 --> 00:31:53,735
We gotta get out of here.

435
00:31:55,363 --> 00:31:57,447
Can I go with you?

436
00:31:58,199 --> 00:32:00,992
Yeah, we all gotta get out of here.
That's the point.

437
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,536
I could drop out of school.

438
00:32:02,703 --> 00:32:06,540
No. No, absolutely not. You gotta finish.
I'll work something out.

439
00:32:10,336 --> 00:32:14,631
Derek, can we please go eat?
I'm fucking starving here.

440
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,883
I don't give a shit!
Go wait in the living room!

441
00:32:17,051 --> 00:32:19,553
- God.
- I want him out of my house.

442
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,264
I know, I know. Look.

443
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:39,698
He's an idiot. He's always been an idiot.

444
00:32:39,866 --> 00:32:42,576
Whatever, dude. He can't help it.
I gotta do that paper.

445
00:32:42,743 --> 00:32:45,078
Look, I'm gonna catch up with you
later tonight.

446
00:32:45,246 --> 00:32:48,165
Not at Cameron's, all right?
I need you to stay away from there.

447
00:32:48,332 --> 00:32:51,710
- Why? I thought we were gonna hang.
- Trust me. I'll explain it later.

448
00:32:51,878 --> 00:32:54,838
I need you to stay away from the party,
all right?

449
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,506
- Whatever.
- Hey, I'm not kidding.

450
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,758
Promise me you'll stay
away from that party.

451
00:32:58,926 --> 00:33:01,344
I'm not fucking 14 anymore, all right?

452
00:33:02,471 --> 00:33:03,847
Whatever.

453
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:07,309
God!

454
00:33:13,065 --> 00:33:14,608
Come on, let's go.

455
00:33:16,485 --> 00:33:18,945
- Where are you parked?
- Out back.

456
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:30,976
- Yeah, that's the whole bunch.
- Right.

457
00:34:31,143 --> 00:34:33,770
It didn't take long for Derek
to make a name for himself.

458
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,064
And Cameron knew just how to use it.

459
00:34:36,232 --> 00:34:38,191
You sure you don't wanna
stick around?

460
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:40,527
You know I'd love to...

461
00:34:40,695 --> 00:34:42,195
but I gotta be careful.

462
00:34:42,363 --> 00:34:43,530
Yeah, I know.

463
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:47,200
- We'll see you back at the house, then.
- Right.

464
00:34:47,368 --> 00:34:48,868
- All right.
- Good luck.

465
00:34:49,036 --> 00:34:51,121
He sent Derek to the kids...

466
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:52,872
to the frustrated ones.

467
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,210
The ones who were sick of getting their
asses kicked by black & Mexican gangs.

468
00:34:57,378 --> 00:34:58,712
Don't just be some punk...

469
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:00,130
be part of something.

470
00:35:00,673 --> 00:35:02,799
All right, let's go. Pull it together.

471
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:07,595
And everybody ate it up.
They did whatever Derek told them to.

472
00:35:08,222 --> 00:35:10,515
Let's go. Come on,
we're not here to fucking socialize.

473
00:35:12,268 --> 00:35:14,811
- Shut the fuck up.
- Check this shit out, man.

474
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:18,898
You want a little toke? Huh? Go ahead.

475
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:21,526
- Curtis, what is that?
- Aw, come on, Derek.

476
00:35:21,694 --> 00:35:23,903
Weed is for niggers.
Put that away right now.

477
00:35:24,071 --> 00:35:27,073
- Aw, Jesus fucking Christ.
- Have a little self-respect.

478
00:35:29,076 --> 00:35:32,620
All right, listen up.
We need to open our eyes.

479
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:39,252
There's over 2 million illegal immigrants
bedding down in this state tonight.

480
00:35:40,588 --> 00:35:43,965
This state spent $3 billion last year...

481
00:35:44,133 --> 00:35:47,510
on services for people who had
no right to be here in the first place.

482
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,095
Three billion dollars.

483
00:35:49,263 --> 00:35:54,309
400 million dollars just to lock up
a bunch of illegal immigrant criminals...

484
00:35:54,477 --> 00:35:57,354
who only got into this country
because the INS decided...

485
00:35:57,521 --> 00:36:01,232
it's not worth the effort
to screen for convicted felons.

486
00:36:03,778 --> 00:36:06,863
Who gives a shit?
Our government doesn't give a shit.

487
00:36:08,282 --> 00:36:10,116
Our border policy is a joke.

488
00:36:10,659 --> 00:36:14,371
So is anybody surprised that south
of the border they're laughing at us?

489
00:36:14,538 --> 00:36:16,289
- Laughing at our laws.
- Yeah.

490
00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:19,292
Every night these parasites
stream across the border...

491
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,044
like some fucking pinata exploded.

492
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:22,379
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Don't laugh!

493
00:36:23,464 --> 00:36:26,883
There's nothing funny going on here.
This is about your life and mine.

494
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:31,346
It's about decent, hardworking Americans
falling through the cracks...

495
00:36:31,514 --> 00:36:34,057
and getting the shaft.
The government cares about...

496
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:38,728
the constitutional rights of a bunch of
people who aren't citizens of this country!

497
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:42,857
On the Statue of Liberty, it says, "Give
me your tired, your hungry, your poor."

498
00:36:43,025 --> 00:36:45,610
Well, it's Americans who are
tired and hungry and poor.

499
00:36:45,778 --> 00:36:49,322
And I say until you take care of that,
close the fucking book!

500
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,408
Because we're losing.

501
00:36:52,034 --> 00:36:55,328
We're losing our right
to pursue our destiny.

502
00:36:55,496 --> 00:36:57,163
We're losing our freedom...

503
00:36:57,331 --> 00:37:01,167
so that a bunch of fucking foreigners
can come in and exploit our country.

504
00:37:01,794 --> 00:37:04,170
And this isn't something
that's going on far away.

505
00:37:04,338 --> 00:37:07,215
This isn't happening in places
we can't do anything about it.

506
00:37:07,383 --> 00:37:11,845
It's happening right here! Right in our
neighborhood. Right in that building.

507
00:37:12,012 --> 00:37:15,348
Archie Miller ran that grocery store
since we were kids here.

508
00:37:15,516 --> 00:37:18,309
Dave worked there, Mike worked there.

509
00:37:18,477 --> 00:37:22,105
He went under, and now some fucking
Korean owns it, who fired these guys...

510
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:26,568
and is making a killing because
he hired 40 fucking border-jumpers.

511
00:37:26,735 --> 00:37:30,113
I see this shit going on and I don't see
anybody doing anything about it.

512
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,115
And it fucking pisses me off!

513
00:37:34,326 --> 00:37:36,202
So look around you.

514
00:37:37,246 --> 00:37:39,456
This isn't our neighborhood.
It's a battlefield.

515
00:37:39,623 --> 00:37:42,584
We're on a battlefield tonight.
Make a decision.

516
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:45,712
Are we gonna stand on the sidelines...

517
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,673
quietly standing there
while our country gets raped?

518
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:50,258
Fuck that.

519
00:37:50,426 --> 00:37:52,218
Are we gonna ante up
and do something?

520
00:37:52,386 --> 00:37:53,887
- Fuck, yeah!
- Hell, yeah!

521
00:37:54,054 --> 00:37:55,305
You're goddamn right we are.

522
00:38:08,235 --> 00:38:09,277
Come here!

523
00:38:09,445 --> 00:38:13,239
Don't you know it's against the law
to hire border-jumpers, you nip bastard?

524
00:38:15,242 --> 00:38:17,202
Fuck that! Fuck that!

525
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:24,292
Sweetheart. No, you don't need this.
We're not gonna hurt you.

526
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,045
Please! Please, no!

527
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:30,340
You fucking spic!

528
00:38:33,886 --> 00:38:36,054
You know what?
I think this bitch is hungry.

529
00:38:36,222 --> 00:38:38,264
This bitch stinks.
Get me cleaning products.

530
00:38:38,432 --> 00:38:40,350
Smells like fish and chips
and guacamole.

531
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:41,809
Here we go.

532
00:38:41,977 --> 00:38:43,853
Yeah, that's it.

533
00:38:58,744 --> 00:39:00,286
Get the fuck up!

534
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:06,167
Get down!

535
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:15,885
Have some fucking beans,
you goddamn beaner.

536
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:17,220
Yeah!

537
00:39:17,805 --> 00:39:19,889
- Take my job.
- You donkey bitch!

538
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:25,645
Get some of that in there.

539
00:39:25,813 --> 00:39:28,940
- Throw it on, throw it on.
- Hey, that's a great color on you.

540
00:39:29,108 --> 00:39:30,900
You can get a white woman's job,
bitch.

541
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:33,778
- A little better than this one, huh?
- Yeah.

542
00:39:33,946 --> 00:39:36,990
- White.
- You can move up in the world, huh?

543
00:39:38,284 --> 00:39:40,076
Asshole!

544
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,957
Let's go. We're out of here.
Everybody out. Let's go. Now. Now!

545
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,503
All right, let's go! Let's go!

546
00:39:51,463 --> 00:39:53,923
- Let's go.
- Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.

547
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:55,842
Let's go.

548
00:39:58,971 --> 00:40:02,140
No green card, no fucking work,
comprendes?

549
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:06,185
- Come on. Come on!
- Go, go, go.

550
00:40:06,353 --> 00:40:07,687
We're fucking done! Come on!

551
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:37,884
Dad was gone.
But things were almost normal again.

552
00:40:38,052 --> 00:40:41,554
Derek had a good job.
Mom was starting to live a little.

553
00:40:41,722 --> 00:40:45,892
Everyone was feeling so good
that we just didn't see it coming.

554
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,685
Maybe we should have.

555
00:40:47,936 --> 00:40:51,397
The irony is that most of the stores
that were destroyed during the riots...

556
00:40:51,565 --> 00:40:54,150
- ...were owned by black people.
- That's stupid, though.

557
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:55,777
Why trash your own neighborhood?

558
00:40:55,944 --> 00:40:58,738
Well, that's my point.
It's an irrational act.

559
00:40:58,906 --> 00:41:03,201
It's like an expression of rage
by people who feel neglected...

560
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:04,911
and turned away by the system.

561
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:07,872
Exactly.
I mean, it's like we had in Watts...

562
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,458
or the riots in Chicago in '68...

563
00:41:10,626 --> 00:41:12,085
I don't buy that for a minute.

564
00:41:12,252 --> 00:41:15,922
Calling a riot an irrational expression
of rage, that's such a cop-out.

565
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:18,549
It's opportunism at its worst.
A bunch of people...

566
00:41:18,717 --> 00:41:21,844
grabbing any excuse they can find
to go and loot a store.

567
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:24,013
The fact these people ripped off stores...

568
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:26,849
in their own communities
reflects that these people...

569
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:28,810
have no respect for the law.

570
00:41:28,977 --> 00:41:33,356
And certainly no concept of community
or civic responsibility.

571
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:37,110
Wait a minute. White people commit
crimes against white people too.

572
00:41:37,277 --> 00:41:40,613
But they're not offing each other
in record numbers all over America.

573
00:41:40,781 --> 00:41:42,615
Look at the statistics, for chrissakes.

574
00:41:42,783 --> 00:41:47,203
One in every three black males is in
some phase of the correctional system.

575
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:51,374
Is that a coincidence or do these people
have a racial commitment to crime?

576
00:41:52,084 --> 00:41:53,710
Not only that. They're proud of it.

577
00:41:53,877 --> 00:41:56,921
Maybe it says something about prejudice
in the judicial system.

578
00:41:57,089 --> 00:41:58,965
If you wanna talk about
criminal statistics...

579
00:41:59,133 --> 00:42:02,802
you might wanna take a look at
the social inequalities that produce them.

580
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,971
Yap, yap. You know what?
That's exactly what I hate.

581
00:42:05,139 --> 00:42:07,890
You're taking one thing
and calling it something else...

582
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:12,145
and alleviating the responsibility that
these people have for their own actions.

583
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:13,813
It's like saying:

584
00:42:13,981 --> 00:42:17,275
"It's not a riot, it's rage.
It's not crime, it's poverty."

585
00:42:17,443 --> 00:42:21,571
It's just nonsense. It's bullshit. It's
exactly what happened in this trial too.

586
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:25,158
Because the media twisted things around
so people focused on these cops...

587
00:42:25,325 --> 00:42:26,868
whether they'd get convicted...

588
00:42:27,035 --> 00:42:30,163
and whether Rodney King's
civil rights had been violated.

589
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:32,457
Everybody lost sight
of Rodney King himself.

590
00:42:32,624 --> 00:42:35,585
The guy's a multiple felon
by his own admission.

591
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:39,839
He's high as a goddamn kite, driving
120 miles an hour down the highway.

592
00:42:40,007 --> 00:42:43,760
He gets pulled over by a bunch of cops,
and he attacks them.

593
00:42:43,927 --> 00:42:46,512
He attacked police officers.
Bottom line. And he walked.

594
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,516
And there's some yahoo with a video
camera who turned it on halfway through...

595
00:42:50,684 --> 00:42:52,560
so all we see is them hitting him.

596
00:42:52,728 --> 00:42:56,773
Exactly. Powell and Koon winding up
and cracking him with billy clubs...

597
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,484
and Briseno's kicking him
in the back of the skull.

598
00:42:59,651 --> 00:43:01,986
And people are going,
"Oh, this poor guy."

599
00:43:02,154 --> 00:43:03,362
Poor guy who attacked 4 cops.

600
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:06,449
And those cops end up on the stand
defending themselves...

601
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:09,994
for using absolutely standard,
textbook self-defense procedures.

602
00:43:10,162 --> 00:43:12,121
I don't think the tape showed that at all.

603
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:15,208
You didn't think so?
And what, you're an authority, Ma?

604
00:43:16,251 --> 00:43:17,543
Murray, what do you think?

605
00:43:19,171 --> 00:43:23,132
I did think that the police used
their clubs rather excessively.

606
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,636
Who are you to say what's excessive?
I think it was totally appropriate.

607
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:29,722
They're in a better position
to make that judgment call than you are.

608
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:34,060
In fact, we as society, grant cops a certain
amount of authority to make those calls...

609
00:43:34,228 --> 00:43:37,980
because we acknowledge that their job
is difficult and dangerous.

610
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:41,901
You know? Unfortunately, very few people,
like, respect that authority.

611
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:44,904
Look who's talking about respect here,
Mr. Junior-KKK.

612
00:43:45,072 --> 00:43:47,031
- What?
- Davina.

613
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:50,076
You wanna go to college, Davina?
You should learn to listen.

614
00:43:50,244 --> 00:43:53,246
I didn't say I respected laws.
I acknowledge a cop's authority.

615
00:43:53,413 --> 00:43:56,749
I don't respect laws that let monkeys
like Rodney King on the street.

616
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:58,709
Second, I am not, as you well know...

617
00:43:58,877 --> 00:44:03,589
a member of a low-rent, disorganized
bunch of rednecks like the fucking KKK.

618
00:44:04,091 --> 00:44:06,092
Please. So take your head
out of your ass.

619
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:08,803
You've gotten off the point.

620
00:44:10,097 --> 00:44:13,599
- I had a point. That wasn't the point.
- Do you have one? What is your point?

621
00:44:13,767 --> 00:44:15,601
All right, think about this.

622
00:44:15,769 --> 00:44:17,937
If Danny had been
walking across the street...

623
00:44:18,105 --> 00:44:22,483
- ...and Rodney King had plowed into him...
- Can we just drop this Rodney King thing?

624
00:44:22,776 --> 00:44:24,110
Mm-hm.

625
00:44:31,118 --> 00:44:32,910
Who would like some dessert?

626
00:44:34,496 --> 00:44:35,788
We're having a discussion.

627
00:44:35,956 --> 00:44:38,207
We're having a nice discussion, right?

628
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:41,043
If Rodney King had been hopped up
on Chivas Regal and PCP...

629
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,296
and killed Danny,
you'd sing a different tune.

630
00:44:43,463 --> 00:44:46,007
I didn't see him hit anybody
and neither did you.

631
00:44:46,174 --> 00:44:47,925
He didn't happen to kill anybody.

632
00:44:48,093 --> 00:44:51,178
- Thank God.
- Keep it down, okay? Ally's sleeping.

633
00:44:54,141 --> 00:44:57,977
If he had, though? Come on, think about it.
If that monkey had run some kid over...

634
00:44:58,145 --> 00:45:01,063
everybody would have a different
opinion of this matter.

635
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,941
They'd be focused on Rodney King
and not on these officers.

636
00:45:04,109 --> 00:45:06,402
But instead, he just attacked a few cops.

637
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:10,448
Now all the sudden it's Hands Across
America for this total son of a bitch.

638
00:45:10,616 --> 00:45:11,824
I mean, it blows my mind.

639
00:45:11,992 --> 00:45:13,993
We're hung up on this notion
we have some...

640
00:45:14,161 --> 00:45:16,746
obligation to help
the struggling black man.

641
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:20,499
Cut him some slack until he can overcome
these historical injustices.

642
00:45:20,667 --> 00:45:23,085
It's crap. This stuff you guys
are saying perpetuates it.

643
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:24,629
All this liberal nonsense.

644
00:45:24,796 --> 00:45:28,174
Everyone's looking the other way
while our country rots from inside out.

645
00:45:28,342 --> 00:45:32,011
Christ, Lincoln freed the slaves,
what, like, 130 years ago?

646
00:45:32,179 --> 00:45:34,764
How long does it take
to get your act together?

647
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:37,850
Well, Jews have been persecuted
for over 5000 years.

648
00:45:38,018 --> 00:45:41,771
Are you saying that it's wrong
to feel sensitive about anti-Semitism?

649
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:46,192
Forget that. I'm with you.
I am with you all the way, baby.

650
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:50,196
- I'm sick of these liberal hypocrites.
- Here we go again. I love this part.

651
00:45:50,364 --> 00:45:53,282
Well, look at the way that they
scapegoated Chief Gates.

652
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,952
They'd come down that hard
on black Willie Williams?

653
00:45:56,119 --> 00:45:59,497
- No way. The video was a setup.
- Jesus Christ. Can I please be excused?

654
00:45:59,873 --> 00:46:02,041
- Yes.
- No, you cannot. Don't interrupt.

655
00:46:02,209 --> 00:46:05,044
Excuse me, I was talking.
I listened to you.

656
00:46:05,212 --> 00:46:06,712
The hell do you think you are?

657
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,799
- She's in the middle of a point.
- Who do you think you are?

658
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,092
- Sit down!
- No. Fuck you!

659
00:46:11,259 --> 00:46:13,511
- Sit down! Shut up!
- Derek, calm down.

660
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:15,012
- Sit down!
- Derek, calm down.

661
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,556
- Shut up!
- Don't tell him to shut up!

662
00:46:17,724 --> 00:46:19,558
- Sit your ass down! No.
- Fuck you, move!

663
00:46:19,726 --> 00:46:21,978
- Sit down, shut up!
- Get out of my way! Move!

664
00:46:22,145 --> 00:46:23,354
Goddamn it, Derek, move!

665
00:46:23,522 --> 00:46:25,648
Shut your mouth
and give my girlfriend respect.

666
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:28,067
Derek, what are you trying to prove?

667
00:46:28,235 --> 00:46:31,904
Murray, stay out of it! Come here. Hey.
Where do you think you're going?

668
00:46:32,072 --> 00:46:35,950
- Derek, let her go! Derek, let her go!
- Come here!

669
00:46:36,118 --> 00:46:38,369
You need to learn
some fucking manners, Davina.

670
00:46:38,537 --> 00:46:41,414
- Shut your fucking mouth! Shut up!
- Derek!

671
00:46:41,581 --> 00:46:43,082
Stop!

672
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:45,292
She can't breathe!

673
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:47,545
Let her go!

674
00:46:47,713 --> 00:46:49,463
Are you gonna apologize?

675
00:46:49,631 --> 00:46:51,799
Are you gonna apologize? Are you?

676
00:46:51,967 --> 00:46:53,217
You're a fucking asshole.

677
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,928
I hate you!

678
00:47:04,646 --> 00:47:06,772
What are you doing, Derek?
This is your family.

679
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:10,443
Right, my family. So you know what?
I don't give two shits about you...

680
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:14,030
anybody else or what you think.
You're not part of it, never will be.

681
00:47:14,197 --> 00:47:16,449
- That has nothing to do with it!
- It doesn't?

682
00:47:16,616 --> 00:47:18,200
You don't think I see
what you're doing?

683
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:21,954
You think I'll sit here and smile while
some kike tries to fuck my mother?

684
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:23,998
It's never gonna happen!

685
00:47:24,166 --> 00:47:27,168
Fucking forget it. Not on my watch.
Not while I'm in this family.

686
00:47:27,335 --> 00:47:30,463
I will fucking cut your Shylock nose off
and stick it up your ass...

687
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:32,965
before I let that happen.
Coming in here...

688
00:47:33,133 --> 00:47:37,970
and poisoning my family's dinner with your
Jewish, nigger-loving, hippie bullshit!

689
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,477
Fuck you!

690
00:47:44,644 --> 00:47:46,437
Yeah, walk out.

691
00:47:46,605 --> 00:47:48,731
Asshole-fucking, Cabala-reading
motherfucker!

692
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:50,441
Get the fuck out of my house!

693
00:47:55,614 --> 00:47:57,615
You see this?
That means "not welcome."

694
00:48:10,462 --> 00:48:11,921
- What did I do?
- You disgust me!

695
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:14,256
You disgust me! Bring him to our table!

696
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:16,175
Primping your hair and your dress!

697
00:48:17,177 --> 00:48:20,429
- Don't touch me! All tarted up!
- What did I do to you?

698
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:24,058
How could you bring him to Dad's table?
How could you go from Dad to that?

699
00:48:24,226 --> 00:48:25,351
Aren't you ashamed?

700
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:28,813
I'm ashamed that
you came out of my body!

701
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:36,028
Go run to your fucking kike!
Go run to him!

702
00:48:41,243 --> 00:48:44,203
It's okay. I'm proud of you, baby.

703
00:48:51,044 --> 00:48:52,711
I'm so sorry, Doris.

704
00:48:53,213 --> 00:48:55,047
I really am.

705
00:49:02,848 --> 00:49:06,392
- He's gone.
- He's just a boy...

706
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,644
without a father.

707
00:49:09,396 --> 00:49:12,481
Doris, you don't know the world
your children are living in.

708
00:49:22,742 --> 00:49:24,201
Goodbye.

709
00:50:09,414 --> 00:50:11,081
Hey. You all right?

710
00:50:13,919 --> 00:50:16,712
- Take this, you fucking dick!
- Hey, no. No, no, come here!

711
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,047
- Fuck you!
- Calm down!

712
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:19,423
- Let go of me!
- Calm down!

713
00:50:19,591 --> 00:50:20,966
Let me go, goddamn it!

714
00:50:21,134 --> 00:50:23,135
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Fuck you!

715
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:27,014
I would never hurt you. You know that.

716
00:50:27,182 --> 00:50:29,225
Come on, I screwed up. I lost control.

717
00:50:29,392 --> 00:50:30,809
It's not you.

718
00:50:30,977 --> 00:50:32,311
I'm sorry.

719
00:50:32,479 --> 00:50:34,647
Come on, I'd never hurt you guys.
I'd never hurt you.

720
00:50:34,814 --> 00:50:36,774
You know that. I'd do anything for you.

721
00:50:36,942 --> 00:50:38,150
I don't believe you.

722
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,402
I trust you, Derek.

723
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,455
Hi.

724
00:50:51,623 --> 00:50:54,083
Hi. What are you doing out of bed, huh?

725
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:56,168
- Want a plane ride?
- Yeah.

726
00:50:56,336 --> 00:50:58,170
Going for takeoff.

727
00:50:59,714 --> 00:51:02,549
- Woo-hoo!
- Heh-heh-heh.

728
00:51:02,717 --> 00:51:03,801
Oh, no.

729
00:51:03,969 --> 00:51:05,803
No, no! Don't crash!

730
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,514
Gotta go to Mom.

731
00:51:08,682 --> 00:51:10,516
She's a crazy flier.

732
00:51:10,684 --> 00:51:14,353
Kiss Mom. Oh, yeah.

733
00:51:15,146 --> 00:51:16,689
Okay.

734
00:51:22,404 --> 00:51:26,156
- You don't feel too hot.
- No, it's in my chest.

735
00:51:26,324 --> 00:51:28,659
- What are you up to?
- I'm just thinking.

736
00:51:29,244 --> 00:51:30,536
A lot of that going around.

737
00:51:30,704 --> 00:51:33,497
- I don't even know how we got here.
- Mom.

738
00:51:33,665 --> 00:51:36,292
Like I let you all down.
I don't know when it happened.

739
00:51:36,459 --> 00:51:38,335
Mom, it's okay.

740
00:51:38,503 --> 00:51:40,170
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

741
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:43,966
It's cold in here. No wonder you're sick.

742
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,427
Don't get sick from cold,
you get sick from germs.

743
00:51:46,594 --> 00:51:49,888
No, you get sick from smoking.

744
00:51:50,932 --> 00:51:53,851
You gotta quit. It's not good for you.

745
00:51:59,733 --> 00:52:01,900
What are you looking
at me like that for?

746
00:52:02,068 --> 00:52:04,695
When are you gonna let that
beautiful hair grow back?

747
00:52:06,406 --> 00:52:08,532
The day you quit smoking.

748
00:52:11,494 --> 00:52:12,745
Deal.

749
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,831
I better get Ally to bed.

750
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,416
- Say good night to Mom?
- Mm-hm.

751
00:52:17,584 --> 00:52:19,877
Then you have to go to bed. Come on.

752
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:22,713
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, baby.

753
00:52:23,757 --> 00:52:24,923
Good night, Mom.

754
00:52:57,123 --> 00:53:00,584
I go back to that night
again and again in my mind.

755
00:53:00,752 --> 00:53:02,628
I try to stop it from happening.

756
00:53:02,796 --> 00:53:04,797
I want you out of this house.

757
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:07,883
That's fine. I'll be gone in the morning.

758
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:09,468
He can move in with me.

759
00:53:10,804 --> 00:53:13,097
In my mind,
I imagine what would've happened...

760
00:53:13,264 --> 00:53:16,433
if I hadn't gone into that room
and told him.

761
00:53:17,977 --> 00:53:19,061
Danny, get down!

762
00:53:20,563 --> 00:53:23,315
No, Danny!

763
00:53:24,609 --> 00:53:25,818
Mommy!

764
00:53:39,582 --> 00:53:41,792
Nigger, you just fucked with
the wrong bull.

765
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,002
- Come here!
- Get off!

766
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:47,631
You should've learned your place
on the fucking basketball court!

767
00:53:47,799 --> 00:53:50,801
But you fucking monkeys
never get the message!

768
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:53,345
My father gave me that truck,
you motherfucker!

769
00:53:53,513 --> 00:53:54,930
You ever shoot at firemen?

770
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:56,974
You come here, you shoot at my family?

771
00:53:57,142 --> 00:53:59,518
I'm gonna teach you a real lesson,
motherfucker.

772
00:53:59,686 --> 00:54:01,687
Put your fucking mouth on the curb.

773
00:54:01,855 --> 00:54:02,855
Come on, man!

774
00:54:03,022 --> 00:54:05,482
Put it on the curb! Right now!

775
00:54:09,362 --> 00:54:11,989
- That's it.
- Derek, no!

776
00:54:13,867 --> 00:54:16,493
No!

777
00:54:16,661 --> 00:54:18,036
Now say good night.

778
00:54:30,717 --> 00:54:32,342
Fucker.

779
00:54:38,057 --> 00:54:41,435
Drop your weapon!
Put your weapon on the ground!

780
00:54:41,603 --> 00:54:43,228
Put your hands up!

781
00:54:43,396 --> 00:54:45,397
I said, get your hands up!

782
00:54:45,565 --> 00:54:47,065
Now turn around!

783
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:59,161
Put your hands behind your head!

784
00:55:02,582 --> 00:55:04,500
Get down on your knees right now!

785
00:56:01,975 --> 00:56:04,268
It's all right.

786
00:56:04,435 --> 00:56:06,144
It's all right.

787
00:56:08,022 --> 00:56:09,481
Let's go.

788
00:56:10,775 --> 00:56:12,401
Come on.

789
00:56:21,494 --> 00:56:22,869
She ain't gonna open the door?

790
00:56:23,037 --> 00:56:25,622
I don't know.
Someone's there looking at us. Hello?

791
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:27,249
Danny, it's for you.

792
00:56:28,793 --> 00:56:30,335
I'll be right there.

793
00:56:42,974 --> 00:56:46,268
Open the door, Danny!
It's fucking freezing!

794
00:56:46,894 --> 00:56:48,353
Danny, this party's gonna be sick!

795
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:51,356
Come on, Danny!

796
00:57:22,055 --> 00:57:24,222
I'm gonna go get some beers.

797
00:57:36,444 --> 00:57:38,570
Hey, what a party, huh, fat Seth?

798
00:57:38,738 --> 00:57:41,657
I'm not fat, asshole! I'm husky.

799
00:57:42,575 --> 00:57:44,493
What the fuck's up, Seth?

800
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:46,745
Drink up, Danny,
before your brother sees you.

801
00:57:46,913 --> 00:57:48,121
Holy fuck. He's here?

802
00:57:48,289 --> 00:57:49,998
- Yeah, he's here.
- He's fucking here.

803
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:52,376
- Go pay your respects.
- Fuck you, Seth.

804
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:57,089
Let's go talk to Cameron, Danny.

805
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,801
- Father Vinyard?
- How's it going? I'm Jason, this is Chris.

806
00:58:00,968 --> 00:58:03,970
- We're friends with your brother.
- You are a fucking god, man!

807
00:58:04,138 --> 00:58:06,431
- Oh, shit, yeah.
- Derek!

808
00:58:11,104 --> 00:58:12,521
Hey.

809
00:58:23,574 --> 00:58:25,701
- I thought you turned that paper in.
- I did...

810
00:58:25,868 --> 00:58:27,786
and now fucking Murray
turned me in...

811
00:58:27,954 --> 00:58:31,164
and so Sweeney's
making me write another one.

812
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:35,919
Good old Sweeney.
He never stops trying, now, does he?

813
00:58:36,879 --> 00:58:39,840
He's one of those proud-to-be-nigger
people. I hate those guys.

814
00:58:40,007 --> 00:58:41,717
Now, wait a minute, Danny.

815
00:58:41,884 --> 00:58:43,593
He's not proud.

816
00:58:45,596 --> 00:58:49,433
He's a manipulative,
self-righteous Uncle Tom.

817
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:53,770
He's trying to make you feel guilty
about writing about Adolf Hitler. Yeah.

818
00:58:53,938 --> 00:58:57,607
Some nigger, some spic writes about
Martin Luther King...

819
00:58:57,775 --> 00:58:59,776
or fucking Cesar "Commie" Chavez...

820
00:58:59,944 --> 00:59:01,737
- Heh-heh-heh.
- ...gets a pat on the head.

821
00:59:02,196 --> 00:59:03,655
Yeah.

822
00:59:04,323 --> 00:59:07,242
I mean, you can see the hypocrisy
in that, can't you?

823
00:59:08,494 --> 00:59:10,078
Definitely.

824
00:59:13,166 --> 00:59:15,125
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

825
00:59:15,293 --> 00:59:16,334
No, listen to me.

826
00:59:18,337 --> 00:59:23,008
I wanna see you, okay? I do. But I
gotta take care of something tonight.

827
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:27,512
- Okay.
- You understand?

828
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,183
Yeah. I'm here.
When you're ready, I'm here.

829
00:59:34,645 --> 00:59:37,355
- Look, would you do something with me?
- Anything.

830
00:59:38,691 --> 00:59:40,358
Leave with me.

831
00:59:41,194 --> 00:59:43,528
- Leave where?
- Leave here. Leave all this.

832
00:59:44,322 --> 00:59:45,822
Just come with me.

833
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:49,534
Why would you wanna leave? They
worship you. You're like a god to them.

834
00:59:49,702 --> 00:59:51,453
If you think we had it good before...

835
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:54,414
- ...wait till you see what it's like now.
- I don't want all that.

836
00:59:54,582 --> 00:59:58,210
I don't want my family involved. Everything
I've done here has fucked it up.

837
00:59:58,377 --> 01:00:01,379
- Do you understand?
- You think what you did was wrong?

838
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:04,299
Oh, baby. Oh, come on.

839
01:00:04,717 --> 01:00:06,843
Those niggers got exactly
what they deserved...

840
01:00:07,011 --> 01:00:08,970
and we all know that.

841
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:10,639
I understand you just got out...

842
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:13,391
but no one's gonna hurt you.
No one can touch you.

843
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:15,018
There's a small army out there.

844
01:00:15,186 --> 01:00:17,521
We won't let a bunch of spooks
kick us out of here.

845
01:00:17,688 --> 01:00:20,816
Stacey, you're not listening to me, okay?
I'm not scared.

846
01:00:20,983 --> 01:00:22,150
I don't want it anymore.

847
01:00:23,069 --> 01:00:25,654
I'm done with it. I'm through with this.

848
01:00:26,531 --> 01:00:27,572
It's...

849
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:29,991
It's bullshit, Stacey.

850
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:33,620
Listen, you don't need this, Stacey.
Come on, trust me.

851
01:00:33,788 --> 01:00:36,873
If you wanna be with me,
just trust me. Come with me.

852
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:39,084
Come on.

853
01:00:39,252 --> 01:00:40,293
You're nuts.

854
01:00:40,461 --> 01:00:42,420
You are nuts. No way.

855
01:00:43,005 --> 01:00:45,549
I don't think you realize
what's been going on here.

856
01:00:45,716 --> 01:00:49,386
We are 10 times what we were,
and we are bloody organized.

857
01:00:49,554 --> 01:00:51,763
I mean, it is like nothing
you have ever seen!

858
01:00:51,931 --> 01:00:53,265
This is a mistake. Forget it.

859
01:00:53,432 --> 01:00:56,268
Wait a second. Wait a second.
What was a mistake?

860
01:00:56,435 --> 01:00:58,520
Stacey, just say goodbye.
Just say goodbye.

861
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:00,730
This isn't you.

862
01:01:00,898 --> 01:01:03,441
- I know you.
- You don't know anything about me, Stacey.

863
01:01:11,284 --> 01:01:13,243
- Hey. Are you Danny's brother?
- Yeah.

864
01:01:13,411 --> 01:01:15,036
Tell him Lizzy's looking for him.

865
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:17,414
Lizzy. Thank you.

866
01:01:20,585 --> 01:01:24,129
We'll let the niggers, kikes and spics
grab for their piece of the pie.

867
01:01:24,297 --> 01:01:25,589
Can't blame them.

868
01:01:27,675 --> 01:01:30,093
Of course,
they're gonna have to fight to get it.

869
01:01:31,053 --> 01:01:34,055
And if we scare the fuck out of people...

870
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:37,767
and a few people get killed
in the process, so be it.

871
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:41,438
You gonna put that
in your paper, Danny?

872
01:01:41,606 --> 01:01:45,483
- Ha, ha. Hey, man.
- Well, look who's here.

873
01:01:45,651 --> 01:01:47,569
The return of the soldier.

874
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:52,741
- What are you doing here, Danny?
- Come on, man. I had to check it out.

875
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:55,952
- You knew I was gonna come.
- Let the kid alone, Derek.

876
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:57,996
He knows when to go to bed.

877
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:03,209
- Go wait outside.
- Come on, I'm not doing anything.

878
01:02:03,377 --> 01:02:05,337
There's a little blond sitting out there.

879
01:02:05,504 --> 01:02:08,673
She keeps asking for you.
She's dying. Come on.

880
01:02:08,841 --> 01:02:11,051
- Well, I gotta check out.
- Go easy on her.

881
01:02:11,218 --> 01:02:13,178
All right.

882
01:02:17,016 --> 01:02:19,142
Wait for me right outside.

883
01:02:23,689 --> 01:02:25,357
Take it easy.

884
01:02:26,067 --> 01:02:27,484
Chill out.

885
01:02:28,486 --> 01:02:30,278
You're on safe ground.

886
01:02:30,905 --> 01:02:33,698
You don't have to watch your ass
around here.

887
01:02:35,326 --> 01:02:37,494
Come on, sit down. Relax.

888
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:41,373
I'm sorry. The party was a little quick.

889
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:45,085
But we're just so damned glad
you're back, Derek.

890
01:02:45,252 --> 01:02:48,630
- It's only natural you should feel funny.
- I don't feel funny, Cam.

891
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:53,385
You know, you made the fat kid nervous.
He thinks the joint messed with your mind.

892
01:02:53,886 --> 01:02:54,886
It did.

893
01:03:02,144 --> 01:03:05,689
<i>♪ Glory, glory hallelujah ♪</i>

894
01:03:06,565 --> 01:03:10,860
<i>♪ Glory, glory hallelujah ♪</i>

895
01:03:11,028 --> 01:03:14,239
<i>♪ The white man marches on ♪</i>

896
01:03:15,074 --> 01:03:17,409
Things have changed
since you've been gone, Derek.

897
01:03:17,576 --> 01:03:19,577
You talk about organization?

898
01:03:19,745 --> 01:03:22,414
Wait till you see
what we've done with the Internet.

899
01:03:22,581 --> 01:03:26,251
We've got every gang from Seattle
to San Diego working together now.

900
01:03:26,419 --> 01:03:28,670
They're not competing.
They're consolidated.

901
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:31,214
Only thing we lack
is a little overall leadership.

902
01:03:32,091 --> 01:03:34,134
And that's where you come in.

903
01:03:34,552 --> 01:03:37,512
Because people out there
got a lot of respect for you, Derek.

904
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:41,933
- When you're ready, talk to me about it.
- Well, you can forget about that.

905
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:44,269
I'm done with it, Cam.

906
01:03:44,437 --> 01:03:47,272
Yeah, well, I know you grew out of that...

907
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,775
shaved-head bullshit
a long time ago, thank God.

908
01:03:50,943 --> 01:03:52,610
I like your hair the way it is now.

909
01:03:52,778 --> 01:03:55,196
See, that's what I mean.
We're thinking bigger now.

910
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:58,116
- No more of this grocery store...
- You're not listening.

911
01:03:58,284 --> 01:04:01,661
I am done with it. All that bullshit
out there and all your bullshit too.

912
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:03,329
I'm out.

913
01:04:03,497 --> 01:04:06,541
I understand how you feel.
You've just done some hard time...

914
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:08,626
Don't fucking talk to me about hard time.

915
01:04:08,794 --> 01:04:10,920
- You don't know a thing about it.
- I done mine.

916
01:04:11,088 --> 01:04:13,339
You didn't do shit.
I found out about your story.

917
01:04:13,507 --> 01:04:17,135
You did two months, then rolled over
on two kids and let them go down for you.

918
01:04:17,303 --> 01:04:19,304
So don't feed me your fucking lies,
Cameron!

919
01:04:20,973 --> 01:04:23,058
All right, then. This is stupid.

920
01:04:23,225 --> 01:04:24,726
I'm done.

921
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:27,270
Look, you go cool off.
Get laid. Do something.

922
01:04:27,813 --> 01:04:30,148
Get your head on straight,
then I'll talk to you.

923
01:04:30,316 --> 01:04:32,275
But it doesn't matter if I don't, does it?

924
01:04:32,443 --> 01:04:34,736
You got the next crop
all lined up and ready to go...

925
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:37,989
- ...you fucking chicken hawk!
- Excuse me?

926
01:04:38,157 --> 01:04:40,617
You prey on people, Cam!
You use them!

927
01:04:40,785 --> 01:04:43,578
I lost three years of my life
for your fucking phony cause...

928
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:45,622
but I am onto you,
you fucking snake.

929
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:48,333
Hey, Derek. Watch it. Be careful.

930
01:04:48,501 --> 01:04:49,751
Remember where you are.

931
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:53,463
This is not a fucking country club
where you can waltz in and out of here...

932
01:04:53,631 --> 01:04:55,298
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

933
01:04:55,466 --> 01:04:58,551
I came in here to tell you one thing:
I am out. Out!

934
01:04:58,719 --> 01:04:59,844
And Danny is out too.

935
01:05:00,012 --> 01:05:02,472
You come near my family again,
I'll fucking kill you.

936
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,974
Well, excuse me, but fuck you, Derek.

937
01:05:05,142 --> 01:05:07,310
You can't come barking threats at me.

938
01:05:07,478 --> 01:05:10,021
You can do whatever you want,
but Danny is a good kid.

939
01:05:10,189 --> 01:05:14,275
He's not some whining pussy like you.
He needs my help and I'll give it to him.

940
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:16,152
If you come near Danny again...

941
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:19,280
I will feed you your fucking heart,
Cameron.

942
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:21,241
I won't have to.

943
01:05:22,409 --> 01:05:24,202
He'll come to me.

944
01:05:25,371 --> 01:05:27,789
I'm more important to him now
than you'll ever be.

945
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:33,169
Shit!

946
01:05:33,671 --> 01:05:36,256
You're a fucking dead man, Vinyard.

947
01:05:51,605 --> 01:05:53,398
Hey, hey, hey. Where's Cameron?

948
01:05:53,566 --> 01:05:54,732
Where the fuck is he?

949
01:05:55,734 --> 01:05:57,902
- Hey, Derek.
- Hey, Derek.

950
01:05:58,070 --> 01:05:59,779
Stay away from me, Stacey. Danny!

951
01:05:59,947 --> 01:06:02,198
Why don't you share
what you just said to me...

952
01:06:02,366 --> 01:06:05,160
you piece-of-shit, race-trading nigger!

953
01:06:05,327 --> 01:06:07,412
- Fucking nigger?
- You monkey-fucking traitor!

954
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:09,247
Are you a fucking nigger?

955
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:11,249
Hey, Danny! Come on.

956
01:06:11,417 --> 01:06:13,376
He's a fucking nigger. Nigger. Nigger.

957
01:06:13,544 --> 01:06:14,836
Cam's out cold!

958
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:16,754
Where the fuck are you going?

959
01:06:17,923 --> 01:06:19,757
He's got a gun!

960
01:06:20,134 --> 01:06:22,635
- Yo, yo, back up, back up.
- Seth.

961
01:06:22,803 --> 01:06:25,221
You make me fucking sick!

962
01:06:25,389 --> 01:06:27,515
Seth! Put down the fucking gun!

963
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:28,766
Go ahead. Shoot.

964
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:32,604
- Shoot him! Do it, Seth! Shoot him!
- Seth. Holy shit.

965
01:06:32,771 --> 01:06:33,897
- Traitor.
- Kick his ass.

966
01:06:34,064 --> 01:06:36,274
- Seth!
- Do it, Seth, do it.

967
01:06:36,442 --> 01:06:38,067
- Shoot him.
- Do it! Shoot him!

968
01:06:38,694 --> 01:06:39,986
Oh, God.

969
01:06:40,154 --> 01:06:41,237
Back up. Move.

970
01:06:43,407 --> 01:06:45,617
Back up. Back up. Back the fuck up.

971
01:06:45,784 --> 01:06:48,119
Move. Move.

972
01:06:48,287 --> 01:06:49,412
Easy, Derek. Hey. Hey.

973
01:07:11,185 --> 01:07:13,478
- Danny, easy.
- Fuck you. Who do you think you are?

974
01:07:13,646 --> 01:07:15,480
Danny, Danny. Relax. Relax.

975
01:07:15,648 --> 01:07:19,150
- Who do you think you are?
- Danny. Take it easy, Dan. Take it easy.

976
01:07:19,318 --> 01:07:21,653
I fucking hate you, Der!

977
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:23,738
All right. Shh, shh. I mean it.

978
01:07:24,406 --> 01:07:26,741
Hey, come on. Come on.
Shut up. Shut up.

979
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:28,993
- Take it easy.
- What's happened to you, Der?

980
01:07:29,870 --> 01:07:32,163
Take it easy. Take it easy.

981
01:07:32,331 --> 01:07:34,499
What's happened to you, Der?

982
01:07:43,008 --> 01:07:45,426
Come on. Come on.

983
01:07:48,681 --> 01:07:50,515
This is so fucked.

984
01:07:50,683 --> 01:07:52,183
Look. I'm sorry. All right?

985
01:07:52,351 --> 01:07:54,978
You weren't supposed to see that.
I told you not to come.

986
01:07:55,145 --> 01:07:57,355
Fuck you, man.

987
01:07:57,856 --> 01:07:59,315
That was so fucked up.

988
01:07:59,483 --> 01:08:01,401
I know. I know.

989
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:04,404
- God.
- It wasn't supposed to happen that way.

990
01:08:04,571 --> 01:08:06,114
That was fucked up.

991
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:08,700
- That's all there is to it.
- Not what I had planned.

992
01:08:08,867 --> 01:08:11,452
It just all went to shit.

993
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,705
It went to shit.

994
01:08:13,872 --> 01:08:15,331
Totally out of control.

995
01:08:17,084 --> 01:08:19,544
What's fucking happening to you, man?

996
01:08:24,883 --> 01:08:26,676
Hey. Look at me.

997
01:08:30,055 --> 01:08:31,556
I can't go back to that, Dan.

998
01:08:32,391 --> 01:08:33,891
Can't go back to what?

999
01:08:34,059 --> 01:08:38,563
To any of it. Those guys, the gang,
that life. I'm done with it.

1000
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:44,235
What happened to you up there?

1001
01:08:52,202 --> 01:08:56,164
C Block! Back at the chow!
Don't be late today, you piece of shit!

1002
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:58,041
Let's go! You wanna eat today?

1003
01:08:58,208 --> 01:09:00,209
Get up! Five minutes!

1004
01:09:00,377 --> 01:09:02,545
This is my fucking house! Get up!

1005
01:09:02,713 --> 01:09:04,922
What the fuck's your problem,
you asshole?

1006
01:09:05,424 --> 01:09:06,716
Move!

1007
01:09:06,884 --> 01:09:08,176
Joe, open the fucking gates.

1008
01:09:08,594 --> 01:09:10,136
All right, back up.

1009
01:09:15,434 --> 01:09:17,352
Five minutes. Step forward.

1010
01:09:17,519 --> 01:09:19,729
Those beds better be made.

1011
01:09:22,524 --> 01:09:25,777
After two days in that place,
I didn't think I'd make it a week.

1012
01:09:25,944 --> 01:09:27,445
Come on there, motherfuckers.

1013
01:09:27,613 --> 01:09:29,781
You wanna eat today, you piece of shit?

1014
01:09:29,948 --> 01:09:33,284
You white-trash piece of shit.
You think you're fucking special?

1015
01:09:33,452 --> 01:09:36,954
Button that top button. Let's go! Move!

1016
01:09:37,122 --> 01:09:40,249
Are you fucking eyeballing me?
Don't eyeball-fuck me, asshole.

1017
01:09:40,417 --> 01:09:42,585
I'll fucking kill you.

1018
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:45,797
Fucking keep my eye on you,
you white piece of shit.

1019
01:09:47,758 --> 01:09:50,635
Don't fucking eyeball me, boy,
or I'll fucking skull-fuck you!

1020
01:09:50,803 --> 01:09:52,553
Step forward.

1021
01:09:54,181 --> 01:09:55,973
Turn to the left.

1022
01:09:57,142 --> 01:09:59,477
Step forward to chow. Let's go.

1023
01:10:00,646 --> 01:10:01,646
Come on.

1024
01:10:01,814 --> 01:10:04,232
Hey, fish, straight ahead.
Straight ahead, fucker.

1025
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,441
Let's go.

1026
01:10:06,485 --> 01:10:08,569
All the wrong people
knew who I was anyway...

1027
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:12,031
so I figured I'm just gonna put
up a flag and hope a friend sees it.

1028
01:11:15,387 --> 01:11:17,138
That's the catapult right there.

1029
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:38,242
- How you doing?
- Good.

1030
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:39,911
Have a seat.

1031
01:11:41,413 --> 01:11:44,290
- Spike. Good to meet you.
- Hey.

1032
01:11:52,925 --> 01:11:56,928
Don't fuck with me, all right? Because
I'm the most dangerous man in this prison.

1033
01:11:57,804 --> 01:11:59,013
You know why?

1034
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,807
Because I control the underwear.

1035
01:12:08,774 --> 01:12:12,151
All right, we pick them up over here
and we sort them over there.

1036
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:15,112
I hope you work out, all right?
The last guy they sent me...

1037
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:19,242
didn't wear no drawers,
couldn't read the sizes in the drawers...

1038
01:12:19,409 --> 01:12:21,202
and used to sniff the drawers.

1039
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:23,454
We got two sizes: Medium and large.
All right?

1040
01:12:23,622 --> 01:12:26,082
All you do is put the mediums
with the mediums...

1041
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:27,792
and the large with the large.

1042
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:31,546
It's a boring job, but it's better than
that last shit they had me doing.

1043
01:12:31,713 --> 01:12:35,967
I spent two years in the kitchen, ha,
scrubbing hot-ass pots and pans.

1044
01:12:36,134 --> 01:12:38,928
That, you don't wanna do. All right?

1045
01:12:39,096 --> 01:12:41,138
You should be happy
that you landed this job.

1046
01:12:41,306 --> 01:12:44,642
Ain't no telling what the hell
they'll have you do in the joint.

1047
01:12:45,978 --> 01:12:47,520
By the way, uh...

1048
01:12:49,273 --> 01:12:50,565
what are you in for?

1049
01:12:53,986 --> 01:12:55,820
Probably robbed some old lady, huh?

1050
01:13:07,165 --> 01:13:09,292
Okay, I know your kind, right?

1051
01:13:09,459 --> 01:13:11,669
Badass peckerwood with an attitude.

1052
01:13:13,422 --> 01:13:15,423
Well, let me tell you something, man.

1053
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:17,300
You better watch your ass.

1054
01:13:17,467 --> 01:13:19,218
Because in the joint...

1055
01:13:19,386 --> 01:13:21,345
you the nigger, not me.

1056
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:28,936
I was a year in. I thought I was cruising.

1057
01:13:29,104 --> 01:13:31,856
Then everything
started getting complicated.

1058
01:13:56,923 --> 01:13:58,549
I'll take care of that, all right?

1059
01:13:58,717 --> 01:14:00,343
What the fuck is that?

1060
01:14:02,095 --> 01:14:03,679
What's that all about?

1061
01:14:03,847 --> 01:14:07,058
Oh, that's just politics, man.
Favors, you know.

1062
01:14:09,227 --> 01:14:11,312
He's doing favors for that fucking spic?

1063
01:14:13,273 --> 01:14:17,401
Mitch has got a little something extra
on the side with them boys, you know.

1064
01:14:18,111 --> 01:14:19,487
You're kidding, right?

1065
01:14:20,572 --> 01:14:21,656
No.

1066
01:14:22,199 --> 01:14:25,701
That's bullshit, man.
Somebody should say something to him.

1067
01:14:25,869 --> 01:14:27,453
What the fuck is he thinking?

1068
01:14:27,621 --> 01:14:29,914
Mitch is the only reason
why you're not a corpse.

1069
01:14:30,082 --> 01:14:33,292
- Remember that.
- You know what? I don't fucking give a shit.

1070
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:36,587
I can take care of myself.
He shouldn't be doing that.

1071
01:14:37,089 --> 01:14:39,757
I'm getting sick of it.
A lot of hard talk around here...

1072
01:14:39,925 --> 01:14:42,176
and not a lot of follow-through.

1073
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:46,430
I think you'd better chill out...

1074
01:14:46,598 --> 01:14:50,393
on the preaching bullshit, okay?
We're getting a little tired of that shit.

1075
01:14:52,104 --> 01:14:53,938
Ease up on it.

1076
01:15:23,969 --> 01:15:25,678
What are you doing here, Doris?

1077
01:15:25,846 --> 01:15:27,471
I was in the neighborhood.

1078
01:15:27,639 --> 01:15:30,266
Well, look, I told you I don't want you
all coming here.

1079
01:15:30,434 --> 01:15:33,310
I don't care what you told me, okay?

1080
01:15:33,478 --> 01:15:34,770
I need to talk to you now.

1081
01:15:55,876 --> 01:15:56,917
So how is everyone?

1082
01:15:57,085 --> 01:16:02,506
Davina's great.
She's, uh, getting straight A's almost.

1083
01:16:02,674 --> 01:16:04,925
And, uh, Ally's walking...

1084
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:07,261
and starting to talk a little.

1085
01:16:11,975 --> 01:16:14,935
- How's Danny?
- Danny?

1086
01:16:16,188 --> 01:16:17,772
Danny.

1087
01:16:19,024 --> 01:16:21,609
He holds you up so high.

1088
01:16:21,777 --> 01:16:24,195
He thinks you're the greatest.

1089
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:28,157
He's always bragging about you
to Cameron...

1090
01:16:28,867 --> 01:16:30,117
and all his new friends.

1091
01:16:33,955 --> 01:16:35,915
He's starting to remind me of you.

1092
01:16:36,082 --> 01:16:38,751
Jesus, don't sound so worried, all right?

1093
01:16:38,919 --> 01:16:40,419
I'm sure he's fine.

1094
01:16:40,587 --> 01:16:44,381
I mean, he's 16 years old, Doris.
He's not gonna be a little angel forever.

1095
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,219
You think because I watched
my first-born fuck up his entire life...

1096
01:16:48,386 --> 01:16:52,389
that I can sit here and see my baby
follow him down the same toilet?

1097
01:16:52,557 --> 01:16:55,184
You know what? I can't fix all
this shit from up here, okay?

1098
01:16:55,352 --> 01:16:56,727
I'm not asking you to.

1099
01:16:56,895 --> 01:17:00,064
It makes me feel bad. I'm trying to get
through this, you make it harder.

1100
01:17:00,232 --> 01:17:03,234
You think you're the only one
doing time, Derek?

1101
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:05,820
You think you're here all alone?

1102
01:17:05,987 --> 01:17:07,822
You think I'm not in here with you?

1103
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:21,877
Fuck, man.

1104
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:28,926
Every day you go through these sheets
like you gonna get to the end of them.

1105
01:17:29,928 --> 01:17:32,513
Look, nigga, will you chill the fuck out?

1106
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:35,891
Goddamn! No matter how fast
you get through them, man...

1107
01:17:36,059 --> 01:17:38,561
they'll keep bringing them in
and bringing them in.

1108
01:17:38,937 --> 01:17:42,439
Throwing them around ain't gonna do
a thing but give you a heart attack.

1109
01:17:42,607 --> 01:17:44,108
Know what? That's cool with me.

1110
01:17:44,276 --> 01:17:46,694
But you're gonna give me
a goddamn heart attack too!

1111
01:17:55,537 --> 01:17:57,955
I know, I know.
I'm just a dumb stupid nigger, right?

1112
01:17:58,123 --> 01:17:59,832
What do I know?

1113
01:18:01,293 --> 01:18:04,503
I know I ain't the one getting mad
at them damn sheets, though.

1114
01:18:05,088 --> 01:18:09,091
As a matter of fact, the only sheets
I get mad at? I'll tell you.

1115
01:18:11,970 --> 01:18:13,804
"Boys, this is what we gonna do."

1116
01:18:13,972 --> 01:18:15,639
We gonna hate some niggers.

1117
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:19,643
We gonna hate some goddamn niggers. That's
all we'll do, is hate niggers all day.

1118
01:18:19,811 --> 01:18:22,229
I don't know what a nigger is,
but we'll hate them.

1119
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:24,315
My cousin Derek
is in the pen right now...

1120
01:18:24,482 --> 01:18:28,569
"..working next to a nigger,
driving him nigger crazy."

1121
01:18:46,796 --> 01:18:49,089
See? That's the ticket.

1122
01:18:50,133 --> 01:18:52,051
Nice and easy.

1123
01:18:52,886 --> 01:18:54,678
Now we can ignore each other in peace.

1124
01:18:58,725 --> 01:19:00,768
I go, "What you doing?"
Know what he tells me?

1125
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:04,021
He goes, "It's better than the pig
I just tried to fuck."

1126
01:19:07,025 --> 01:19:08,317
Never lets me finish.

1127
01:19:08,485 --> 01:19:11,195
- Why don't you tell a joke?
- Did you fuck him too?

1128
01:19:12,864 --> 01:19:17,159
I get back, she's laying on her back.
She likes the wine bottle thing, right?

1129
01:19:18,203 --> 01:19:19,870
What's up?

1130
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:28,003
Will you get to the fucking point?
Jesus Christ.

1131
01:19:34,302 --> 01:19:38,055
He was taking it from the Mexicans
and dealing it out to his own people.

1132
01:19:38,223 --> 01:19:41,684
He didn't believe in shit.
None of them did.

1133
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:43,936
Took too damn long.

1134
01:19:51,444 --> 01:19:53,320
Hey. Hey, Vinyard!

1135
01:20:07,127 --> 01:20:08,711
What?

1136
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:11,797
Come on, man. Don't look at me like that.

1137
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:14,341
You know what that smells like, right?

1138
01:20:14,509 --> 01:20:17,594
Come on, don't tell me this smell
doesn't remind you of a woman.

1139
01:20:19,097 --> 01:20:20,556
God, I miss that smell, man.

1140
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:25,019
The job I had on the outside
wasn't much better than this one.

1141
01:20:25,186 --> 01:20:28,772
But at least I gotta go home at night
and lie down next to this sweet smell.

1142
01:20:31,943 --> 01:20:33,736
God, I miss that.

1143
01:20:34,571 --> 01:20:36,405
You got a woman?

1144
01:20:36,573 --> 01:20:38,073
Yeah, you got a woman, man.

1145
01:20:38,241 --> 01:20:40,909
Let me give you some advice. All right?

1146
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:43,120
She comes to visit you...

1147
01:20:43,913 --> 01:20:47,791
whatever you do, no matter what,
don't let her leave here in a fight.

1148
01:20:47,959 --> 01:20:51,045
Don't let her walk out of here
with a bad attitude. If you do...

1149
01:20:51,212 --> 01:20:55,966
you spend next week wondering if she's
getting her fuck on with somebody else.

1150
01:20:56,134 --> 01:20:59,428
She comes to see you it's nothing
but sweet talk through that glass.

1151
01:20:59,596 --> 01:21:01,972
Send her away floating, all right?

1152
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:05,142
Because it's not like the real world.
Where you can fight...

1153
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:08,896
but it's cool to fight because you
can make up and have make-up sex.

1154
01:21:09,064 --> 01:21:12,149
You know what I'm saying? That angry sex.
That sex with an attitude.

1155
01:21:12,317 --> 01:21:15,819
Where you lay on your back and let her
take out all that aggression on you.

1156
01:21:15,987 --> 01:21:17,905
All guys know that, man.
That's that good sex.

1157
01:21:18,073 --> 01:21:20,074
It's that pow, pow, pow.

1158
01:21:20,241 --> 01:21:23,077
Let her get on top
and she's gonna punish you first, right?

1159
01:21:23,244 --> 01:21:24,745
"You been a bad boy, huh?"

1160
01:21:25,497 --> 01:21:27,623
You been a bad boy
and I'm gonna punish you.

1161
01:21:27,791 --> 01:21:32,920
I'm gonna put it on you.
Don't you ever let me catch you...

1162
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:34,671
looking at another woman.

1163
01:21:35,173 --> 01:21:37,716
Yeah. I may forgive you if you bring it.

1164
01:21:37,884 --> 01:21:40,219
I think I can. I forgive.

1165
01:21:40,386 --> 01:21:43,889
I forgive. Oh, right there. Right there.
You hitting it. My spot.

1166
01:21:44,057 --> 01:21:48,185
That's it. Right. Yeah. Yeah.
Yes. I forgive you.

1167
01:21:48,353 --> 01:21:51,855
I forgive you. I for... I for...
I forgive you.

1168
01:21:52,023 --> 01:21:54,024
"I love you!"

1169
01:21:57,862 --> 01:21:59,530
Let's keep it moving.

1170
01:22:11,835 --> 01:22:15,295
How do you figure the Lakers to ever
be a bigger dynasty than the Celtics?

1171
01:22:15,463 --> 01:22:18,674
- The Lakers are like a flare-up. A fluke.
- Are you crazy?

1172
01:22:18,842 --> 01:22:21,802
One good coach for four years.
The Celtics are like a dynasty!

1173
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:26,390
Come on, man. The Celtics were, like,
the ugliest team in the history of sports.

1174
01:22:26,558 --> 01:22:28,475
A dynasty of ugly motherfuckers, man.

1175
01:22:28,643 --> 01:22:30,686
Look at Kevin McHale.

1176
01:22:30,854 --> 01:22:33,522
James Worthy?
The guy has a head like a melon.

1177
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:36,233
- No, he had ladies.
- I can't even talk to you.

1178
01:22:36,401 --> 01:22:39,069
- I don't even know what you're saying.
- You are tweaking.

1179
01:22:39,237 --> 01:22:41,321
Boston Celtics.

1180
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:42,823
- How many is that?
- That's enough.

1181
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:44,575
Enough? All right.

1182
01:22:53,877 --> 01:22:55,752
I lost count, man.

1183
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,754
- Doesn't matter, man.
- All right.

1184
01:22:57,922 --> 01:22:59,756
Who's counting anyway?

1185
01:23:06,764 --> 01:23:08,724
All right, so I wanna know something.

1186
01:23:10,268 --> 01:23:11,768
What the fuck landed you in here?

1187
01:23:11,936 --> 01:23:14,021
You didn't kill.
Too skinny for a gangbanger.

1188
01:23:14,189 --> 01:23:18,192
That a bitch. Don't judge a book by its
cover. I can throw these things, all right?

1189
01:23:18,359 --> 01:23:21,612
- You know what I'm saying?
- Whatever. Come on. What did you do?

1190
01:23:21,779 --> 01:23:25,616
Yo, man, it's none of your business,
all right? It's embarrassing, all right?

1191
01:23:27,285 --> 01:23:29,995
What? Embar...?
Everybody in here is embarrassed.

1192
01:23:30,163 --> 01:23:33,123
You think? Nobody in here
got away with anything.

1193
01:23:33,499 --> 01:23:35,125
What did you do?

1194
01:23:36,836 --> 01:23:39,963
Look, man, I stole a TV, all right?

1195
01:23:40,173 --> 01:23:41,965
So you stole a TV.
What's embarrassing?

1196
01:23:42,133 --> 01:23:46,220
I stole a TV from a store that was right
next door to a doughnut shop, all right?

1197
01:23:46,387 --> 01:23:49,306
I run out, the store owner's
running behind me, yelling, bam.

1198
01:23:49,474 --> 01:23:51,892
I run into three cops, all right?

1199
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:54,144
I told you it was embarrassing
and you laugh.

1200
01:23:54,312 --> 01:23:56,480
Wait a second. Wait a second.

1201
01:23:57,482 --> 01:23:59,107
That doesn't make sense.

1202
01:24:00,193 --> 01:24:02,569
No, you didn't get six years
for stealing a TV.

1203
01:24:02,737 --> 01:24:05,989
- Come on.
- I go in the store, I come out...

1204
01:24:06,157 --> 01:24:09,493
the police officer grabs my arm,
TV falls on his foot and breaks it.

1205
01:24:09,661 --> 01:24:11,828
They said I threw the TV at the officer.

1206
01:24:11,996 --> 01:24:13,956
Assault. Six years.

1207
01:24:14,123 --> 01:24:15,958
Come on. Tell the truth.

1208
01:24:16,125 --> 01:24:18,001
You chucked it at him. Or something.

1209
01:24:18,169 --> 01:24:21,129
Like I said, I came out of the store...

1210
01:24:21,297 --> 01:24:24,841
he grabbed my arm, it fell on his foot.

1211
01:24:29,764 --> 01:24:33,642
What you got for me, baby?
What you got for me? What you got for me?

1212
01:24:34,811 --> 01:24:37,062
There you go, baby. Yeah, baby.

1213
01:24:37,230 --> 01:24:39,189
That's what I'm talking about!

1214
01:24:43,486 --> 01:24:45,070
Put some D on him, now.

1215
01:25:17,145 --> 01:25:18,228
Fuck you.

1216
01:25:18,396 --> 01:25:20,230
Get a towel! Hold him. Hold him.

1217
01:25:27,572 --> 01:25:30,240
- You wanna be a nigger, sweet boy?
- Fuck you!

1218
01:25:30,408 --> 01:25:32,743
We're gonna treat you like one.

1219
01:25:33,995 --> 01:25:35,579
Come on.

1220
01:25:50,178 --> 01:25:51,428
Fuck you.

1221
01:25:56,934 --> 01:25:58,518
- That was real sweet.
- Fuck you!

1222
01:26:32,095 --> 01:26:34,137
How is he?

1223
01:26:34,305 --> 01:26:36,264
Well, he took six stitches.

1224
01:26:44,649 --> 01:26:45,857
Hey, man.

1225
01:27:18,099 --> 01:27:20,684
Oh, man, what the hell
are you doing here, anyway?

1226
01:27:20,852 --> 01:27:24,521
Well, I came to talk about Danny,
but we don't have to do that right now.

1227
01:27:24,689 --> 01:27:25,939
I brought you some books.

1228
01:27:28,609 --> 01:27:31,528
Well, what about him? You know?
Don't keep me in suspense.

1229
01:27:32,155 --> 01:27:34,197
He's headed right where you are.

1230
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:39,286
Oh, man, you know what? My mother
already laid this trip on me, man.

1231
01:27:39,454 --> 01:27:41,580
Danny's not my responsibility.
You know?

1232
01:27:41,747 --> 01:27:45,250
What do you expect me to do? It doesn't
help. Am I supposed to feel guilty?

1233
01:27:45,418 --> 01:27:49,713
I don't want you to do anything. I need
to know the truth about how you feel.

1234
01:27:49,881 --> 01:27:53,091
Well, what?
You think I want him in here? I mean...

1235
01:27:53,259 --> 01:27:56,511
I don't know. I don't know what I feel.
I'm all...

1236
01:27:58,514 --> 01:28:00,056
I feel a little inside out.

1237
01:28:00,725 --> 01:28:03,894
Um, you know, I don't know.
There's some things...

1238
01:28:04,562 --> 01:28:06,229
that don't fit.

1239
01:28:06,397 --> 01:28:08,190
Well, that happens.

1240
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:12,068
Look, you are too damn smart
to be floating around here...

1241
01:28:12,236 --> 01:28:14,821
pretending you don't see
the holes in this bullshit.

1242
01:28:14,989 --> 01:28:17,991
Listen, I said I was confused.
I didn't say I didn't believe in it.

1243
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:20,535
All right.
That's why you have to stay open.

1244
01:28:21,287 --> 01:28:23,246
Right now,
your anger is consuming you.

1245
01:28:23,414 --> 01:28:26,416
Your anger is shutting down the brain
God gave you.

1246
01:28:26,584 --> 01:28:30,086
You've been talking about what's going
on in me since I was in high school.

1247
01:28:30,254 --> 01:28:33,256
How the fuck do you know so much
about what's going on inside me?

1248
01:28:33,424 --> 01:28:35,550
No, I know about me.

1249
01:28:35,718 --> 01:28:39,930
I know about this place.
I know about the place you are in.

1250
01:28:40,473 --> 01:28:42,599
What do you know
about the place I'm in?

1251
01:28:42,767 --> 01:28:44,643
There was a moment...

1252
01:28:44,810 --> 01:28:47,646
when I used to blame
everything and everyone...

1253
01:28:47,813 --> 01:28:51,900
for all the pain and suffering
and vile things that happened to me...

1254
01:28:52,068 --> 01:28:54,444
that I saw happen to my people.

1255
01:28:55,404 --> 01:28:57,322
I used to blame everybody.
Blame white people.

1256
01:28:57,490 --> 01:29:00,075
Blame society. Blame God.

1257
01:29:00,493 --> 01:29:04,120
I didn't get no answers, because
I was asking the wrong questions.

1258
01:29:04,288 --> 01:29:06,957
- You have to ask the right questions.
- Like what?

1259
01:29:09,752 --> 01:29:12,295
Has anything you've done
made your life better?

1260
01:29:23,307 --> 01:29:24,641
No.

1261
01:29:32,858 --> 01:29:34,234
You gotta help me now.

1262
01:29:37,405 --> 01:29:39,155
Just help me.

1263
01:29:40,658 --> 01:29:42,659
Get me out of here, you know?

1264
01:29:45,663 --> 01:29:48,415
I'm up in four months for review.

1265
01:29:50,001 --> 01:29:51,751
Put in a word for me.

1266
01:29:51,919 --> 01:29:54,337
I already have.
So you're out there, then what?

1267
01:29:54,505 --> 01:29:57,173
I don't wanna fuck up
my family anymore.

1268
01:29:57,341 --> 01:29:59,509
I'll go as far away as I can get.

1269
01:30:00,177 --> 01:30:01,303
That's not good enough.

1270
01:30:02,763 --> 01:30:07,309
You want my help, you gotta do better
than that. My help is not unconditional.

1271
01:30:08,311 --> 01:30:11,271
But running just ain't good enough.

1272
01:30:44,221 --> 01:30:45,513
Fuck him.

1273
01:30:45,681 --> 01:30:48,350
Fuck him. Fuck him.
Let the niggers have him.

1274
01:30:50,144 --> 01:30:51,895
Yo, what's up, D?

1275
01:30:52,063 --> 01:30:55,106
Yo, what's all that bullshit you pulled
in the mess hall, man?

1276
01:30:55,733 --> 01:30:58,485
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you fucking crazy?

1277
01:30:59,695 --> 01:31:01,821
D! Look at me, man!

1278
01:31:01,989 --> 01:31:03,406
You can't make it on your own.

1279
01:31:03,574 --> 01:31:07,535
I'm not afraid of those fucking pussies.
There was six of them, they jumped me.

1280
01:31:07,703 --> 01:31:10,163
That won't happen again.
I hope they fucking try.

1281
01:31:10,331 --> 01:31:12,874
Look, I'm not talking about
your peckerwood friends!

1282
01:31:13,042 --> 01:31:15,251
They were protecting your stupid ass!

1283
01:31:15,419 --> 01:31:17,253
You dissed them in public.

1284
01:31:17,421 --> 01:31:19,464
Now you're on your fucking own!

1285
01:31:19,632 --> 01:31:21,841
Yo, man, I'm talking about the brothers.

1286
01:31:22,009 --> 01:31:25,679
They're gonna fuck you, toss your salad,
then smoke your motherfucking ass!

1287
01:31:25,846 --> 01:31:29,766
Tell me something I don't already know.
You think I haven't thought about that?

1288
01:31:29,934 --> 01:31:33,061
They're gonna come for me,
they're gonna come. Nothing I can do.

1289
01:31:35,439 --> 01:31:37,482
What can I do, man?

1290
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:43,947
So I was right back where I started.

1291
01:31:44,115 --> 01:31:45,865
Every day, I was sure it was my day.

1292
01:31:47,743 --> 01:31:50,161
Every time I stepped out of my cell.

1293
01:31:50,329 --> 01:31:52,789
Every time I got in that shower.

1294
01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:59,754
I figured it was only a matter of time
before they made a move.

1295
01:32:01,465 --> 01:32:03,842
I just hoped that it'd be quick.

1296
01:32:35,499 --> 01:32:37,542
But it never came.

1297
01:32:38,961 --> 01:32:42,088
I couldn't figure it out.
I knew some of them were itching for it.

1298
01:32:42,256 --> 01:32:44,674
But after a while
I just put my head down...

1299
01:32:44,842 --> 01:32:48,178
read the stuff that Sweeney sent me,
and I kept to myself.

1300
01:32:50,848 --> 01:32:53,475
The last 6 months in that place
I was like a ghost.

1301
01:33:08,032 --> 01:33:09,783
What's up, man? You getting out?

1302
01:33:13,078 --> 01:33:15,872
What the fuck you waiting on?
Get the fuck on out of here.

1303
01:33:18,334 --> 01:33:21,669
- Yeah, you know, I got this funny feeling.
- Oh, yeah? What's that?

1304
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:27,967
I'm thinking maybe the only reason I'm
getting out of here in one piece is you.

1305
01:33:28,135 --> 01:33:30,178
Come on, man.
Get the fuck out of here, man!

1306
01:33:30,346 --> 01:33:33,807
You think I'm gonna put my neck on
the line for a crazy-ass peckerwood?

1307
01:33:34,725 --> 01:33:37,894
Yeah. Right. Stupid.

1308
01:33:43,776 --> 01:33:45,568
That's what I thought.

1309
01:33:49,782 --> 01:33:51,741
I owe you, man.

1310
01:33:52,576 --> 01:33:54,911
Man, you don't owe me shit, all right?

1311
01:33:57,248 --> 01:33:59,123
Yes, I do.

1312
01:34:09,051 --> 01:34:10,385
You'll be out in no time.

1313
01:34:10,553 --> 01:34:12,679
Come on, man.
It's a piece of cake. All right?

1314
01:34:14,974 --> 01:34:17,892
You just take it easy on the brothers,
all right? The brothers!

1315
01:34:28,487 --> 01:34:30,446
God, man.

1316
01:34:32,324 --> 01:34:34,617
I'm sorry, Der.

1317
01:34:34,952 --> 01:34:37,412
Sorry that happened to you.

1318
01:34:38,455 --> 01:34:41,583
No, I'm not. I'm lucky.

1319
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:43,334
I feel lucky because...

1320
01:34:43,502 --> 01:34:45,420
it's wrong, Dan.

1321
01:34:47,172 --> 01:34:51,134
It's wrong and it was eating me up.
It was gonna kill me.

1322
01:34:51,302 --> 01:34:54,012
And I kept asking myself all the time...

1323
01:34:54,179 --> 01:34:57,140
how did I buy into this shit,
you know?

1324
01:34:58,809 --> 01:35:01,060
And it's just because I was pissed off.

1325
01:35:01,562 --> 01:35:05,356
And nothing I ever did
ever took that feeling away.

1326
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:09,152
I mean, I killed two guys, Danny.
I killed them.

1327
01:35:11,488 --> 01:35:13,907
And that didn't make me
feel any different.

1328
01:35:14,825 --> 01:35:18,286
It just got me more lost. And I'm
tired of feeling pissed off, Danny.

1329
01:35:19,163 --> 01:35:20,830
I'm just tired of it.

1330
01:35:22,166 --> 01:35:24,334
And I'm not telling you what to do.

1331
01:35:25,169 --> 01:35:26,836
I'm really not.

1332
01:35:27,671 --> 01:35:29,839
But I need you to understand.

1333
01:35:31,425 --> 01:35:34,177
Because I love you
and you're my best friend.

1334
01:35:36,972 --> 01:35:38,765
Do you understand?

1335
01:35:38,933 --> 01:35:40,892
Yeah, I understand.

1336
01:35:44,647 --> 01:35:46,022
All right.

1337
01:35:48,359 --> 01:35:49,525
Whoo!

1338
01:35:49,693 --> 01:35:51,402
Jesus.

1339
01:36:06,293 --> 01:36:08,670
- Hey.
- Hi.

1340
01:36:08,837 --> 01:36:11,130
- Everything okay?
- No, everything's great.

1341
01:36:11,298 --> 01:36:13,883
Great. Yeah.
You wanna sleep in our room?

1342
01:36:14,051 --> 01:36:17,345
- No, thank you. Yeah. This is good. I'm fine.
- You sure?

1343
01:36:18,138 --> 01:36:19,681
Thank you, though.

1344
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:22,141
All right. Come on, let's go.

1345
01:36:43,038 --> 01:36:44,580
Good night.

1346
01:37:51,648 --> 01:37:53,399
I'm gonna take a shower, all right?

1347
01:38:27,101 --> 01:38:31,521
It's hard to look back and see
the truth about people you love.

1348
01:38:31,688 --> 01:38:35,858
I think if you asked Derek why it all went
the way it did, and where it all started...

1349
01:38:36,026 --> 01:38:38,694
he'd still say it started
when our father was murdered.

1350
01:38:39,822 --> 01:38:42,156
But the truth is, it started earlier.

1351
01:38:42,574 --> 01:38:45,451
All right. Are we all meeting together
for the game tonight?

1352
01:38:45,619 --> 01:38:46,953
Yes, definitely.

1353
01:38:47,121 --> 01:38:49,747
Ben's Burgers, 7:00,
then we go watch the big guy play.

1354
01:38:49,915 --> 01:38:52,125
Okay. Yeah.

1355
01:38:52,292 --> 01:38:55,711
- Psyching up for the game?
- Yeah, I'm always ready for that.

1356
01:38:55,879 --> 01:38:59,882
I got an English exam third period.
I'm having a heart attack. I'm not ready.

1357
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:02,677
What's the matter,
afraid you're gonna get a B?

1358
01:39:02,845 --> 01:39:04,679
Might do you good. B minus.

1359
01:39:05,806 --> 01:39:07,557
Don't laugh. This guy is different.

1360
01:39:07,724 --> 01:39:12,186
Dr. Sweeney? This guy's unbelievable.
I've never had a teacher like this.

1361
01:39:12,354 --> 01:39:15,148
He's got two Ph.D.s. I don't know
what he's doing at our school.

1362
01:39:15,315 --> 01:39:18,401
- He's not like other teachers.
- What's he got you reading?

1363
01:39:19,695 --> 01:39:22,071
We got this essay exam on this book,
Native Son.

1364
01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:24,740
- All on this one book.
- Native Son. I don't know that.

1365
01:39:24,908 --> 01:39:26,159
That's a big surprise.

1366
01:39:27,744 --> 01:39:29,996
What? I read.

1367
01:39:30,164 --> 01:39:33,249
Honey, they don't teach
Tom Clancy at school.

1368
01:39:35,169 --> 01:39:36,919
Well, they don't.

1369
01:39:37,087 --> 01:39:39,463
So, what is it? What is this Native Son?
What is it?

1370
01:39:39,631 --> 01:39:41,757
It's this book about this black guy.

1371
01:39:42,342 --> 01:39:44,760
We're doing this
whole black literature unit.

1372
01:39:45,554 --> 01:39:47,221
What is it, Black History Month?

1373
01:39:47,598 --> 01:39:48,806
No, it's just like...

1374
01:39:48,974 --> 01:39:51,601
This guy Sweeney, you know,
it's part of the course now.

1375
01:39:54,897 --> 01:39:56,564
Yeah.

1376
01:39:58,609 --> 01:39:59,859
What?

1377
01:40:00,819 --> 01:40:02,695
Nothing. It's just, you know.

1378
01:40:02,863 --> 01:40:04,739
It's everywhere I look now.

1379
01:40:05,824 --> 01:40:07,116
What?

1380
01:40:08,535 --> 01:40:11,078
This affirmative blaction.

1381
01:40:12,122 --> 01:40:16,042
Honey, a few new books doesn't
qualify as affirmative black action.

1382
01:40:17,294 --> 01:40:18,961
Read the book, ace the guy's test.

1383
01:40:19,129 --> 01:40:21,464
Just don't swallow everything
he feeds you whole.

1384
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:24,133
- Just because you see it on the news.
- But like what?

1385
01:40:24,301 --> 01:40:27,637
All this stuff about making everything
equal. It's not that simple.

1386
01:40:27,804 --> 01:40:29,513
Now you got this book, Native Son.

1387
01:40:29,681 --> 01:40:31,807
What happened to the other books
in the course?

1388
01:40:31,975 --> 01:40:36,020
They're not any good anymore because
Mr. Two-Ph.D. S says they aren't?

1389
01:40:36,188 --> 01:40:40,149
Are you gonna trade in great books
for black books? Does that make sense?

1390
01:40:41,526 --> 01:40:43,402
You gotta question these things, Derek.

1391
01:40:43,570 --> 01:40:45,571
You gotta look at the whole picture.

1392
01:40:45,739 --> 01:40:48,824
We're talking about books here.
But I'm also talking about my job.

1393
01:40:49,243 --> 01:40:52,536
I got two black guys on my squad now
who got their job...

1394
01:40:52,704 --> 01:40:56,332
over a couple of white guys
who actually scored higher on the test.

1395
01:40:57,626 --> 01:41:01,337
That make sense? Huh?
Yeah, sure, everything's equal now...

1396
01:41:01,505 --> 01:41:05,758
but I got two guys watching my back,
responsible for my life...

1397
01:41:05,926 --> 01:41:09,595
who aren't as good as two others.
They got the job because they were black.

1398
01:41:09,763 --> 01:41:12,556
- Not because they were the best.
- That sucks.

1399
01:41:12,724 --> 01:41:14,642
Yeah. Is that what America is about?

1400
01:41:14,810 --> 01:41:16,936
No. America's about
"best man for the job."

1401
01:41:17,104 --> 01:41:19,188
You do your best, you get the job.

1402
01:41:19,356 --> 01:41:22,650
You know, this affirmative action crap...

1403
01:41:22,818 --> 01:41:25,069
I don't know what that's about.
There's some...

1404
01:41:25,237 --> 01:41:27,863
hidden agenda or something going on.

1405
01:41:28,031 --> 01:41:30,116
- You see what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I do.

1406
01:41:30,284 --> 01:41:32,702
I don't know,
I didn't think about it like that.

1407
01:41:32,869 --> 01:41:35,246
- Well...
- This guy, though...

1408
01:41:35,414 --> 01:41:38,332
I don't know. Dr. Sweeney,
he comes on, like, so strong...

1409
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:40,710
it's kind of hard not to listen to him.

1410
01:41:40,877 --> 01:41:42,837
Maybe some of what he says is kind of...

1411
01:41:43,005 --> 01:41:44,630
It's bullshit.

1412
01:41:44,798 --> 01:41:47,049
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

1413
01:41:47,217 --> 01:41:48,801
No, no.

1414
01:41:48,969 --> 01:41:51,470
It's nigger bullshit.

1415
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:55,891
- You see that, don't you?
- Yeah.

1416
01:41:56,727 --> 01:42:00,730
- You gotta watch out for that.
- Yeah, I get what you're saying. I will.

1417
01:42:02,607 --> 01:42:04,066
Good boy.

1418
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:08,529
- I'm proud of you.
- Don't worry about it. I got it.

1419
01:44:12,279 --> 01:44:13,696
It's 5:40 a. M...

1420
01:44:13,864 --> 01:44:18,284
and in about one minute,
I'm gonna watch the sun come up.

1421
01:44:18,535 --> 01:44:20,828
I don't know if I've ever done that.

1422
01:44:21,830 --> 01:44:25,374
Anyway, we're gonna try
to pick things up and start over.

1423
01:44:25,542 --> 01:44:28,502
It won't be easy,
but we're all together again.

1424
01:44:29,379 --> 01:44:31,464
And I feel good.

1425
01:44:32,674 --> 01:44:35,009
I'm not sure if this paper
is what you wanted.

1426
01:44:35,177 --> 01:44:38,971
If I hit the social significance,
or whatever you're looking for.

1427
01:44:39,389 --> 01:44:43,434
But, for what it's worth, thanks a lot.

1428
01:44:57,741 --> 01:45:00,159
Wow. You look great.

1429
01:45:00,327 --> 01:45:02,161
Look at you.

1430
01:45:02,996 --> 01:45:05,915
Yeah. Gotta dress up
for the parole officer.

1431
01:45:06,416 --> 01:45:07,833
Is she cute?

1432
01:45:08,001 --> 01:45:10,586
She is a fat guy named Hector.

1433
01:45:10,754 --> 01:45:12,713
So I'm out of luck.

1434
01:45:15,717 --> 01:45:18,844
I just gotta check in, then I'll see
about getting my old job back.

1435
01:45:19,513 --> 01:45:20,763
Great.

1436
01:45:20,931 --> 01:45:22,932
- Good morning.
- Yes, my love.

1437
01:45:23,099 --> 01:45:26,977
Davina, can you...?
Your sister's gonna help you, honey.

1438
01:45:27,145 --> 01:45:29,063
- You look great. Knock them dead.
- Okay.

1439
01:45:29,231 --> 01:45:30,523
Thanks.

1440
01:45:30,774 --> 01:45:35,069
- What would you like to wear?
- I wanna wear my blue dress today.

1441
01:45:35,237 --> 01:45:38,364
- You do look good.
- Yeah? I feel silly.

1442
01:45:38,532 --> 01:45:40,616
- You look good.
- Yeah?

1443
01:45:43,036 --> 01:45:44,537
You feel good?

1444
01:45:47,290 --> 01:45:50,376
Yeah. Yeah. I feel, you know...

1445
01:45:50,544 --> 01:45:52,628
a little...

1446
01:45:52,796 --> 01:45:54,630
I'm getting there. I'm getting there.

1447
01:45:56,466 --> 01:45:59,593
Listen, I don't know...

1448
01:45:59,761 --> 01:46:02,596
I don't know if it's okay that I'm here.

1449
01:46:06,351 --> 01:46:08,602
I wanna be here.

1450
01:46:26,496 --> 01:46:27,955
- I'm gonna get a paper.
- Cool.

1451
01:46:45,599 --> 01:46:48,225
- What do you want?
- A maple bar and a large milk.

1452
01:46:48,393 --> 01:46:50,060
All right, I got it.

1453
01:46:55,066 --> 01:46:58,736
Let me get a coffee, a maple bar
and a large milk to go.

1454
01:46:58,903 --> 01:47:00,362
Right away.

1455
01:47:08,496 --> 01:47:10,331
- Hey, Derek.
- Hey.

1456
01:47:11,333 --> 01:47:12,541
Derek.

1457
01:47:12,709 --> 01:47:15,210
- We need to talk.
- What's going on?

1458
01:47:15,378 --> 01:47:19,256
Cameron Alexander and Seth Ryan
are at the ICU at St. John's.

1459
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:21,675
- They were jumped last night.
- How bad?

1460
01:47:21,843 --> 01:47:24,094
Well, it looks like they're gonna live.

1461
01:47:24,262 --> 01:47:27,348
- Then they got lucky.
- Somebody's gotta lose, though.

1462
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:32,269
Aw, what?

1463
01:47:32,437 --> 01:47:35,564
We were kind of hoping that maybe
you'd talk to your old crew.

1464
01:47:35,732 --> 01:47:37,900
- Come on. No way.
- This is not a good thing.

1465
01:47:38,068 --> 01:47:40,235
If there's anybody they'll listen to,
it's you.

1466
01:47:40,403 --> 01:47:42,655
No. No, I hate to tell you, but I'm out.

1467
01:47:42,822 --> 01:47:44,865
Those guys are probably
gunning for me now.

1468
01:47:45,033 --> 01:47:46,909
We're asking for your help here, Derek.

1469
01:47:47,077 --> 01:47:49,536
- Did you tell him I was gonna do this?
- Derek.

1470
01:47:55,752 --> 01:47:57,419
This has got nothing to do with me.

1471
01:47:57,587 --> 01:48:00,381
Yes, it does.
It has everything to do with you.

1472
01:48:00,548 --> 01:48:03,258
What are you doing to me?
You know, I'm doing my best.

1473
01:48:03,426 --> 01:48:05,928
I'm going like this to keep
my family in the clear.

1474
01:48:06,096 --> 01:48:08,555
- Don't ask me to fix this.
- I'm not asking that.

1475
01:48:08,723 --> 01:48:12,643
- It was there before me.
- You helped create it. Wanna take a break?

1476
01:48:12,811 --> 01:48:15,062
You take a break, you'll find no peace.

1477
01:48:15,230 --> 01:48:17,606
The way to find peace is to stick.

1478
01:48:18,441 --> 01:48:20,776
It's not gonna make
a fucking bit of difference.

1479
01:48:20,944 --> 01:48:22,486
It might.

1480
01:48:23,905 --> 01:48:26,281
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Do you really know?

1481
01:48:26,449 --> 01:48:29,535
Yes. I'm asking you to do
whatever is in your power to do.

1482
01:48:32,622 --> 01:48:33,956
Man.

1483
01:48:35,917 --> 01:48:37,418
Fuck.

1484
01:48:42,382 --> 01:48:43,966
All right.

1485
01:48:46,136 --> 01:48:48,095
You're gonna get me shot by white boys.

1486
01:48:48,263 --> 01:48:50,973
- I doubt it.
- Yeah, well...

1487
01:48:51,141 --> 01:48:54,518
we're all gonna have a laugh at that,
let me tell you.

1488
01:48:54,686 --> 01:48:57,938
I'm gonna take him to school.
I'll be back in half an hour.

1489
01:48:58,106 --> 01:48:59,481
Come on.

1490
01:48:59,649 --> 01:49:02,943
Hey, you. You got
something good for me this morning?

1491
01:49:03,111 --> 01:49:06,655
- I'll give it to you, Dr. Sweeney. All right?
- Yeah, okay.

1492
01:49:10,994 --> 01:49:12,494
What's going on?

1493
01:49:18,001 --> 01:49:19,460
Come on.

1494
01:49:35,351 --> 01:49:38,353
This is so bad for Seth, man.

1495
01:49:38,521 --> 01:49:41,690
- I wonder how bad they got fucked up.
- I don't know.

1496
01:49:41,858 --> 01:49:44,860
I'm glad they're not dead,
but other than that, I don't care.

1497
01:49:45,695 --> 01:49:46,987
Should we visit them?

1498
01:49:47,155 --> 01:49:49,281
Visit them? No. No, definitely not.

1499
01:49:49,449 --> 01:49:51,784
Definitely not. Just stay out of it.

1500
01:49:51,951 --> 01:49:53,744
Listen, too...

1501
01:49:53,912 --> 01:49:57,956
I saw a car cruising by the house last night
when I pulled out of there with Seth.

1502
01:49:58,124 --> 01:50:00,918
If you get home before me,
look around the street, all right?

1503
01:50:01,085 --> 01:50:03,045
Make sure there's nothing going on.

1504
01:50:04,464 --> 01:50:06,340
Oh, man. This is bad.

1505
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:11,637
- They're after you, man.
- It'll cool off.

1506
01:50:11,805 --> 01:50:13,472
If I made it through Chino...

1507
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:17,226
this should be a piece of cake, right?

1508
01:50:17,393 --> 01:50:20,562
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1509
01:50:21,981 --> 01:50:23,398
Okay.

1510
01:50:23,983 --> 01:50:25,442
What are you gonna do?

1511
01:50:25,610 --> 01:50:27,361
I don't know. I'll work it out. Hey.

1512
01:50:27,529 --> 01:50:29,655
Keep your head up.
Things are gonna be fine.

1513
01:50:29,823 --> 01:50:31,657
It's gonna be fine.

1514
01:50:31,825 --> 01:50:33,534
Go turn that paper in.

1515
01:50:35,745 --> 01:50:38,413
- Okay. All right, see you.
- Hey, hey, Dan.

1516
01:50:46,256 --> 01:50:47,881
I'll see you at home.

1517
01:50:49,801 --> 01:50:51,385
All right?

1518
01:50:51,761 --> 01:50:53,011
Yeah, I'll see you.

1519
01:50:53,179 --> 01:50:55,347
- Hey, good luck, all right?
- Yeah.

1520
01:50:55,723 --> 01:50:57,266
See you later.

1521
01:51:03,189 --> 01:51:05,148
- We're gonna be late.
- We'd better go.

1522
01:51:05,316 --> 01:51:07,901
- Okay.
- All right. Come on.

1523
01:51:30,967 --> 01:51:33,886
- Fine.
- All right. I'll catch up with you, all right?

1524
01:51:34,137 --> 01:51:35,679
See you later.

1525
01:52:56,260 --> 01:52:57,678
- Derek, no!
- Get out of my way!

1526
01:52:57,845 --> 01:52:59,930
- All right. All right.
- Get out of my way!

1527
01:53:00,098 --> 01:53:01,515
Let him go!

1528
01:53:03,184 --> 01:53:07,229
Oh, no. No! No! No!

1529
01:53:07,563 --> 01:53:09,731
Oh, Jesus.

1530
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:14,236
No.

1531
01:53:14,404 --> 01:53:18,573
Oh, no, no. No.

1532
01:53:33,131 --> 01:53:34,840
Oh, Jesus.

1533
01:53:35,008 --> 01:53:37,175
God, what did I do?

1534
01:53:50,565 --> 01:53:55,027
Oh, God.

1535
01:54:05,955 --> 01:54:08,582
So I guess this is where
I tell you what I learned.

1536
01:54:08,750 --> 01:54:11,126
My conclusion, right?

1537
01:54:11,961 --> 01:54:14,046
Well, my conclusion is...

1538
01:54:14,213 --> 01:54:16,214
hate is baggage.

1539
01:54:16,466 --> 01:54:19,760
Life's too short
to be pissed off all the time.

1540
01:54:20,303 --> 01:54:22,179
It's just not worth it.

1541
01:54:24,974 --> 01:54:28,101
Derek says it's always good
to end a paper with a quote.

1542
01:54:28,603 --> 01:54:30,645
He says someone else
has already said it best...

1543
01:54:30,813 --> 01:54:35,317
so if you can't top it,
steal from them and go out strong.

1544
01:54:35,485 --> 01:54:38,153
So I picked a guy I thought you'd like:

1545
01:54:39,739 --> 01:54:43,116
"We are not enemies, but friends."

1546
01:54:43,284 --> 01:54:45,702
We must not be enemies.

1547
01:54:45,870 --> 01:54:48,080
Though passion may have strained...

1548
01:54:48,247 --> 01:54:51,500
it must not break
our bonds of affection.

1549
01:54:51,667 --> 01:54:56,505
The mystic chords of memory
will swell when again touched...

1550
01:54:56,672 --> 01:55:01,301
"..as surely they will be,
by the better angels of our nature."

1551
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:17,700
