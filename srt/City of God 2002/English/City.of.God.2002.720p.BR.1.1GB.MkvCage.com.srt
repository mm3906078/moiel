Fuck, the chicken's getting away!
Go after that chicken, man!

3
00:02:00,169 --> 00:02:01,587
Get that chicken!

00:02:22,608 --> 00:02:25,319
If it's a good photo,
I'll get a job at the paper.

- You think so, Rocket?
- Got to take the risk.

You'd risk your life for a picture? Forget it!

7
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:36,455
You think I want to meet up
with that motherfucking hood?

8
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,335
Get that chicken, bro!

9
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:46,966
Motherfucker!
I told you to grab that chicken!

10
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:48,885
Out of my way!

11
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:51,178
Get that chicken!

If Li'l Ze catches you, he'll kill you.

13
00:03:14,452 --> 00:03:16,621
Yeah, well, he's got to catch me first.

Hey, kid! Get that chicken!

15
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:29,842
Get that chicken!

Shit! The cops!

Don't fucking run off!

18
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,516
Give me that.

Some advice, Rocket.

35
00:04:38,494 --> 00:04:41,497
Don't let Li'l Dice touch that ball. He sucks.

<i>I must tell the story of the Tender Trio.</i>

<i>Back then, I thought

<i>We came to the City of God</i>

<i>hoping to find paradise.</i>

79
00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:27,890
<i>Many families were homeless</i>

80
00:08:28,015 --> 00:08:29,600
<i>due to the flooding</i>

81
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:31,977
<i>and acts of arson in the slums.</i>

<i>Homeless? Off to the City of God!</i>

85
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,074
<i>There was no electricity,
paved streets or transportation.</i>

86
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:48,994
<i>But for the rich and powerful,
our problems didn't matter.</i>

87
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,913
<i>We were too far removed</i>

<i>from the picture postcard image

Do you think I can become

90
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:15,562
I don't know.

91
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,857
Being a lifeguard
is better than a fishmonger.

92
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:21,610
I don't want to sell fish. It stinks.

93
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:24,530
- Are you insulting your father?
- No.

94
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:28,075
So what do you want to be?

95
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,119
I don't know.

96
00:09:30,452 --> 00:09:32,579
Not a hood or a policeman.

97
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:33,956
Why not?

98
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:35,666
I'm scared of getting shot.

99
00:09:41,046 --> 00:09:43,007
Put that thing away, kid.

100
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,969
Are you nuts? Pointing that gun at me?

101
00:09:47,094 --> 00:09:49,471
Take it easy with the kid, Goose.

102
00:09:49,596 --> 00:09:53,851
- Li'l Dice is with me.
- Right. I'm a gangster too.

103
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:55,769
That gas truck didn't bring much.

104
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:57,938
So what? We rob gas trucks every day.

105
00:09:58,063 --> 00:10:00,065
One today, another tomorrow.

106
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,901
No, we need to rob some rich guy's house.

107
00:10:02,985 --> 00:10:05,404
That's the only way to get out of here.

108
00:10:05,487 --> 00:10:08,907
Hell, no.
What you need is to follow my plan.

109
00:10:09,074 --> 00:10:10,159
That's it.

110
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:13,871
The little fart's getting too big
for his britches!

111
00:10:20,711 --> 00:10:24,131
He gets high and starts talking bullshit.

112
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,008
You two junkies

113
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:28,844
aren't worth half as much as that kid.

114
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:34,099
What you got in mind, Li'l Dice?

115
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,603
<i>To be a real hood
you need more than just a gun.</i>

116
00:10:37,644 --> 00:10:39,229
<i>You need ideas.</i>

117
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,526
<i>And Li'l Dice had them.</i>

118
00:10:45,652 --> 00:10:48,447
- ls that the motel?
- Yeah.

119
00:10:48,572 --> 00:10:53,285
We go in, grab the money and get out.
No killing, got that?

120
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:55,079
I need this.

121
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,207
- Don't touch my gun, kid.
- Don't ever do that again.

122
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,084
- Don't point at me.
- Fuck you.

123
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,794
Don't point your finger at me!

124
00:11:01,877 --> 00:11:03,545
Stop acting like a baby!

125
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,131
Here's yours.

126
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:09,009
Awesome! Let's go!

127
00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:13,430
- Not so fast!
- What?

128
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:16,141
You stay here and keep watch.

129
00:11:16,183 --> 00:11:18,727
If the cops come,
shoot that window over there.

130
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:21,605
Why me? Let that dork do that.

131
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:22,856
Look.

132
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,819
I gave you this great plan for free,
while the guy's absolutely useless!

133
00:11:26,902 --> 00:11:29,905
- You just had the idea.
- Exactly!

134
00:11:29,988 --> 00:11:32,366
You're just a kid, remember?

135
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,618
You cover us, okay?

136
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:41,166
You'll get your turn.
Stop trying to rush things.

137
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,335
You stay here.

138
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:51,051
This is a holdup, bitch.

139
00:11:53,971 --> 00:11:58,475
You should be studying or working.

140
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:02,229
You don't even look like hoodlums.

141
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:05,232
Instead, you ought to be
working or studying, boy.

142
00:12:05,315 --> 00:12:07,651
Shut up! What a pain in the ass!

143
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:10,654
Okay, Clipper?

144
00:12:13,073 --> 00:12:14,366
Shall we go in?

145
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,040
I didn't order anything.

146
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:26,044
It's on the house, sir. Hand over the money!

147
00:12:26,753 --> 00:12:29,173
Keep calm. All I want is your cash.

148
00:12:29,214 --> 00:12:30,716
- Don't point that.
- Your wallet!

149
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,730
Hey, man.

150
00:12:44,813 --> 00:12:47,024
What kind of whorehouse is this?

151
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:52,279
- You from the church?
- Yes, brother.

152
00:12:55,824 --> 00:12:56,950
Give it to me!

153
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,412
Slut!

154
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,372
You're flat and flabby!

155
00:13:03,248 --> 00:13:05,542
Want to take her place?

156
00:13:10,297 --> 00:13:12,174
What's going on?

157
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,344
The cops! Let's beat it!

158
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:16,512
Let's go!

159
00:13:20,682 --> 00:13:23,936
Take that car. I'll go get Li'l Dice.

160
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,940
Jesus, what a car!

161
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:37,157
Something fucked up. Li'l Dice is gone.

162
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:39,326
The cops are shooting. Let's go!

163
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:08,313
Slow down! Hold on!

164
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,858
You said you knew how to drive.

165
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,819
I do, so cool it!

166
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,988
Turn! Watch out!

167
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,210
You fucking asshole!

168
00:14:30,294 --> 00:14:33,505
Hey, I didn't do it on purpose.

169
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:35,924
No one saw anything.

170
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,968
So keep your mouth shut, understand?

171
00:14:41,638 --> 00:14:43,473
Hold on, I twisted my ankle.

172
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:46,393
Clipper fucked up his ankle.

173
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:49,187
It fucking hurts.

174
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:52,524
Take him into the woods.
I'll shoot to distract the cops.

175

- In God we trust.
- In God we trust.

176
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:01,533

<i>Shorty is another notorious guy
in the City of God.</i>

178
00:15:06,496 --> 00:15:08,540
<i>But it's not yet time to tell his story.</i>

179
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:13,253
It fucking hurts, Goose.

180
00:15:13,337 --> 00:15:15,881
Shut up.

181
00:15:15,964 --> 00:15:19,009
You sound like a damn sissy, man.

182
00:15:23,805 --> 00:15:24,806
Come on!

183
00:15:25,515 --> 00:15:27,309
Climb up!

184
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:30,145
No one saw anything?

185
00:15:30,228 --> 00:15:32,564
How odd! A car crashes into a bar
and no one saw a thing.

186
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:35,275
I suppose you didn't see anything either?

187
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:37,569
As usual,

188
00:15:37,861 --> 00:15:39,154
no one saw, no one knows.

189
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:40,906
I'm telling you,
nobody knows anything.

190
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,200
So what's up, Shorty?

191
00:15:44,201 --> 00:15:46,328
They're hiding in the woods.

192
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:49,915
Hello, Melonhead.

193
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:53,960
I have this feeling
that they're out in the woods.

194
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,128
The motherfuckers.

195
00:15:55,212 --> 00:15:57,255
They're out in the woods.

196
00:15:57,464 --> 00:16:01,259
Felipe, lock up the car.
Rangel, come with me.

197
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,016
I can't see a thing.
How the hell can they see?

198
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:11,144
Fucking jungle.

199
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,442
They stole a fortune at that motel.

200
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:19,695
I know.

201
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,949
What if we took the money?

202
00:16:25,158 --> 00:16:26,493
Are you crazy?

203
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,454
I'm not getting mixed up in that.

204
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,998
I want to exterminate these guys.

205
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,417
What? Since when is stealing

206
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:39,089
from niggers and thieves a crime?
It won't be hard to nab them.

207
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:41,508
I have a stoolie in the City.

208
00:17:09,077 --> 00:17:13,081
If I catch one Of them, I'll kill him.

209
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,013
Maracana!

210
00:17:28,638 --> 00:17:30,515
Open the door.

211
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,478
What's the matter?

212
00:17:34,603 --> 00:17:37,022
The cops are after me.

213
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,531
Shaggy!

214
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:51,870
The cops are on my ass!

215
00:17:51,912 --> 00:17:53,079
Hide me!

216
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,581
Quick, come in.

217
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,340
Shit.

218
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:06,301
I thought the cops
would be down there all night.

219
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:09,971
I had a vision, Goose.

220
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:13,391
You been smoking something?

221
00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:17,229
- You've had a job, right?
- Right.

222
00:18:17,354 --> 00:18:19,397
What's it like? What do people say?

223
00:18:19,523 --> 00:18:21,691
I worked with my father.

224
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:25,445
And fathers talk a lot of shit.

225
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,240
You know what, Goose?

226
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,408
I'm getting out.

227
00:18:30,534 --> 00:18:33,620
I don't want to die.

228
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:37,040
Wait! The cops are still down there.

229
00:18:37,165 --> 00:18:38,208
I don't give a shit.

230
00:18:41,586 --> 00:18:43,171
I'm going back to the church.

231
00:18:50,178 --> 00:18:52,180
"L will say of the Lord,"

232
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:57,769
"He is my refuge and my fortress,

233
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:06,570
- Stop, motherfucker!
- Don't move!

234
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,905
Stop, or I'll shoot!

235
00:19:12,075 --> 00:19:15,120

<i>The holdup at the motel went down</i>

237

<i>as the bloodiest in history.</i>

238

<i>The destinies of the outlaws

239
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,174

was involved in the heist.

240
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,468
See here?

241
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:35,223
He's a worker, not a hoodlum.

<i>Destiny put Clipper
back into the hands of God.</i>

243

<i>Shaggy was in Bernice's hands.</i>

244

<i>And Goose was in my Father's hands.</i>

245
00:19:55,076 --> 00:19:58,371
Why do you do these things?
You think I'm a fool?

246
00:19:58,496 --> 00:20:00,832
From now on, you'll work with me.

247
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:04,711
Your younger brother
will keep an eye on you.

00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,340
You listen to me.

249
00:20:08,465 --> 00:20:11,176
If I catch you with money that isn't yours,

250
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:14,512
I'll kill you,
and that goes for you, too.

251
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:16,765
Get changed! You start work immediately.

but he'll get over it.

00:20:36,576 --> 00:20:39,746
Give me that, Rocket. It's not for you.

258
00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:41,164
You have to study.

259
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:42,415
Getting shot doesn't scare you?

260
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,501
I'm a hood because I got no brain.

261
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:48,546
But you're smart. You should study.

262
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:51,925
I go to school because
I don't like physical work.

263
00:20:52,717 --> 00:20:54,177
Promise me something.

264
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:57,263
That you'll never touch this gun. Promise?

265
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,516
Let's shake.

266
00:21:01,768 --> 00:21:04,437
We'd better hurry.

267
00:21:05,438 --> 00:21:08,984
I'm gonna sell a lot of fish. And don't laugh.

268
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:11,236
You grinned when I got slapped.

00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,862
- Who, me?
- I saw you.

270
00:21:41,182 --> 00:21:44,769
What is it, Shaggy? Cat got your tongue?

271
00:21:44,853 --> 00:21:47,439
You fidgeting behind me makes me nervous.

272
00:21:47,605 --> 00:21:49,607
I'm thinking of what to say to you.

273
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:51,693
You're thinking, too?

274
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,279
Don't. It'll be your downfall.

275
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:58,700
My heart has chosen you.
And I follow my heart.

276
00:21:58,825 --> 00:22:00,326
Are you pulling my leg?

277
00:22:01,536 --> 00:22:03,747
You never heard of love at first sight?

278
00:22:05,623 --> 00:22:08,251
Hoods don't love, they desire.

279
00:22:08,376 --> 00:22:10,462
You cut down everything I say.

280
00:22:10,587 --> 00:22:13,298
Hoods don't talk, they smooth-talk.

281
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,385
Well, I'll stop wasting my breath on you.

282
00:22:18,219 --> 00:22:20,847
Hoods don't stop, they take a break.

283
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,226
Talking to you about love
sure is complicated.

284
00:22:25,351 --> 00:22:28,646
It's not love, it's a con game.

285
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,539
It's just that I love you.

286
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:50,835

have kids, and a farm,

- Ass-kisser!

326
00:25:21,611 --> 00:25:24,155
- And you?
- I haven't changed.

327
00:25:24,197 --> 00:25:28,493
So what? They've deserted me, that's all.

328
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,912
Then I'm deserting you, too.

329
00:25:31,037 --> 00:25:34,499
I'm splitting, Shaggy.
Come with me, if you want.

330
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,668
Otherwise, I'll go alone.

331
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,184
Fish for sale!

332
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,730
<i>My brother had promised
to stop messing around.</i>

333
00:25:57,814 --> 00:26:00,525
<i>But a hood doesn't stop,</i>

334
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,194
a <i>hood takes</i> a <i>break.</i>

335
00:26:04,821 --> 00:26:07,490
<i>Goose began messing around
with Shorty's wife.</i>

336
00:26:09,617 --> 00:26:13,496
I have trout.
But for special customers like you,

337
00:26:13,621 --> 00:26:15,498
I also have a kisser fish.

338
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:18,209
Hey, that's a mullet!

339
00:26:21,087 --> 00:26:24,799
Doesn't your husband go down on you?

340
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,635
No.

341
00:26:28,511 --> 00:26:31,556
My husband uses his tongue on me.

342
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:33,057
For about half an hour.

343
00:26:33,641 --> 00:26:36,394
And from behind? Do you let him?

344
00:26:36,477 --> 00:26:38,813
Good God, no. Doesn't it hurt?

345
00:26:39,689 --> 00:26:41,774
The first few times.

346
00:26:41,858 --> 00:26:45,278
Then you'll see, it's fantastic.
But you need a banana.

347
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,238
What for?

348
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:50,742
You're missing the good things in life, girl!

349
00:26:50,867 --> 00:26:53,786
You take a banana, warm it up.

350
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:57,248
Put it up your thing
while he takes you from behind.

351
00:26:57,915 --> 00:26:59,250
It's a real rush.

352
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:02,128
Ask your husband.

353
00:27:02,211 --> 00:27:05,256
I couldn't. You don't know him.

354
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:07,633
He's liable to beat me.

355
00:27:07,717 --> 00:27:11,929
Try him. Men go wild for freaky shit like that.

356
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:21,272
Motherfucking nigger!

357
00:27:23,232 --> 00:27:25,276
Slut!

358
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:28,863
Whoring bitch!

359
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:35,787
Rocket, give me your shorts. Quick!

360
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:38,623
Take them off, damn it!

361
00:27:38,706 --> 00:27:40,625
I'm not going naked in the street.

362
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:42,126
You want your brother to die?

363
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,587
Give me your shorts. Now!

364
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,339
Give me your shirt.

365
00:27:49,258 --> 00:27:51,302
Your shorts! Hurry up!

366
00:27:54,013 --> 00:27:58,226
I knew it.
It's always me who forks up for that bum.

367
00:28:06,526 --> 00:28:09,654
The bastard ran off. That's his brother.

368
00:28:09,737 --> 00:28:11,989
- That brat there?
- I'll castrate that fucker.

369
00:28:14,158 --> 00:28:15,827
Fish! Fish for sale!

370
00:28:19,956 --> 00:28:22,041
Hey, kid, come over here.

371
00:28:23,709 --> 00:28:26,421
- Where's your brother?
- He's not working today.

372
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:29,715
- Oh, yeah? Get in.
- I didn't do anything.

373
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:32,051
- Get in!
- What about my fish?

374
00:28:32,135 --> 00:28:33,344
Hurry up, kid!

375
00:28:33,386 --> 00:28:35,054
I don't want to lose my fish!

376
00:28:35,138 --> 00:28:37,014
Forget your fish.

377
00:28:37,056 --> 00:28:39,392
Give me that.

378
00:28:39,475 --> 00:28:41,727
My father will kill me.

379
00:28:41,811 --> 00:28:43,146
That doesn't matter.

380
00:28:54,657 --> 00:28:56,659
Let's go. There's nothing here.

381
00:28:57,034 --> 00:29:01,164
<i>That day, my father swore he never
wanted to see my brother again.</i>

382
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,957
Let's go, Felipe.

383
00:29:06,043 --> 00:29:07,336
<i>And he never did.</i>

384
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:09,714
<i>No one ever saw him in the slum again.</i>

385
00:29:09,755 --> 00:29:12,967
<i>The story of the Tender Trio
was coming to an end.</i>

386
00:29:14,969 --> 00:29:16,512
Li'l Dice?

387
00:29:18,055 --> 00:29:20,391
Shit, man.
I thought you were a goner at the motel.

388
00:29:20,475 --> 00:29:23,227
You're fucking loaded!

389
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:27,023
Don't, Benny. That's our money.

390
00:29:27,815 --> 00:29:31,235
Fuck you.
Cut the crap and give me the money.

391
00:29:31,444 --> 00:29:32,487
Benny.

392
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:36,449
Tell your brother Shaggy
that Shorty is squealing.

393
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,493
I'm leaving the slum.

394
00:29:38,993 --> 00:29:41,329
<i>But Shorty had his hands full.</i>

395
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,552
Let's go see, Stringy.

396
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:09,899
<i>A neighbor called the police before sunrise.</i>

397
00:30:10,858 --> 00:30:13,778
<i>The tabloids went to town.</i>

398
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:17,365
<i>"Man Buries Wife Alive in the City of God."</i>

399
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:20,952
<i>Along with the reporters,
the place was swarming with cops.</i>

400
00:30:21,035 --> 00:30:24,080
<i>The hoodlums took off.</i>

401
00:30:25,748 --> 00:30:28,125
- You want to die?
- It's you who's gonna die

402
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:32,547
if you don't do what I say.
And show the lady more respect.

403
00:30:34,757 --> 00:30:36,133
Let's go, damn it!

404
00:30:37,343 --> 00:30:40,304
- There are police ahead.
- Fuck them, let's go.

405
00:30:40,346 --> 00:30:43,349
- Where to?
- Anywhere, just go.

406
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,061
What's the matter?

407
00:30:47,144 --> 00:30:50,064
Have mercy! This car is a piece of junk.

408
00:30:50,147 --> 00:30:53,234
- My ass! Start the damn thing!
- It needs a push.

409
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,363
Push, shaggy!

410
00:30:57,947 --> 00:30:59,156
Push!

411
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,005
<i>You'?</i>

412
00:31:17,592 --> 00:31:20,469
You want to arrest the thieves? Over there.

413
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:22,972
Nab that guy over there!

414
00:31:47,788 --> 00:31:49,999
Run, Shaggy!

415
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:52,126
Stop the car!

416
00:32:35,252 --> 00:32:37,254
This way! He's over here.

417
00:32:40,383 --> 00:32:42,218
We got that son of a bitch!

418
00:32:57,274 --> 00:32:59,443
- The bastard!
- He's a murderer.

419
00:32:59,527 --> 00:33:04,115
<i>On the day Shaggy died,
I remember the crowds,</i>

420
00:33:04,156 --> 00:33:05,783
<i>and the camera.</i>

421
00:33:07,243 --> 00:33:09,453
<i>I'd always wanted to have one.</i>

422
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,625
Let's go to school.

423
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,886
- Well?
- Let's go to the beach.

424
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,596
But we have an exam.

425
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:34,145
So what? Everyone else is at the beach.

426
00:33:34,228 --> 00:33:36,605
Come on, let's go!

427
00:33:37,106 --> 00:33:40,234
She's in a bikini, but doesn't want to go.

428
00:33:40,943 --> 00:33:43,279
What's that saying you have?

429
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:49,160
"The sun is for everyone.
The beach, for those who deserve it."

430
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,843
<b>THE 70's</b>

431
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,501
<i>I bought my first camera when I was 16.</i>

432
00:33:57,918 --> 00:34:00,588
<i>Like all poor people, I started at the bottom</i>

433
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,466
<i>with the world's cheapest model.</i>

434
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:07,303
So, Rocket? How are things going?

435
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,764
Any luck getting laid yet?

436
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,640
Zilch.

437
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:16,228
<i>Angelica, I was crazy about her.</i>

438
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,856
<i>So, Rocket, still clicking away?</i>

439
00:34:18,939 --> 00:34:23,027
<i>She was gorgeous and the only
girl in our gang who screwed.</i>

440
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,863
<i>I wanted to lose my virginity with her.</i>

441
00:34:25,946 --> 00:34:27,072
With her, buddy?

442
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:30,868
<i>- She's got a guy.
- So? I'm not jealous.</i>

443
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,703
<i>Her father's a sergeant.</i>

444
00:34:32,787 --> 00:34:34,121
<i>No one's perfect.</i>

445
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,540
<i>Closer together!</i>

446
00:34:36,582 --> 00:34:40,044
<i>I was the official photographer of our gang.</i>

447
00:34:40,127 --> 00:34:41,796
<i>The gang of groovies.</i>

448
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:45,925
<i>Everyone paid
to have copies of the pictures.</i>

449
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:53,224
<i>'flags,</i>

450
00:34:53,849 --> 00:34:55,726
move back a little.

451
00:34:55,768 --> 00:34:56,811
Is this okay?

452
00:34:56,977 --> 00:34:58,437
Perfect.

453
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:08,155
I need a joint.

454
00:35:08,781 --> 00:35:11,116
Instead of smoking, man,

455
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,744
you should snort coke. It's far out.

456
00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:17,581
You snort, Tiago? I prefer a good toke.

457
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,254
If you like, I can get it for you.

458
00:35:23,337 --> 00:35:26,924
You can? Then go on, move your ass!

459
00:35:27,049 --> 00:35:29,885
But the choice stuff is coke.

460
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:32,012
That's a real "nercotic."

461
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,889
Narcotic!

462
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,602
Your mouth is all salty, Tiago.

463
00:35:38,727 --> 00:35:40,604
Screw you.

464
00:35:41,397 --> 00:35:43,691
You want to be a lifeguard, Stringy?

465
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:46,443
- You're never in the water.
- My dad's a lifeguard.

466
00:35:46,527 --> 00:35:48,529
I'll bet you a beer I swim better.

467
00:35:48,612 --> 00:35:50,155
You're on.

468
00:35:53,325 --> 00:35:54,577
If you like,

469
00:35:54,618 --> 00:35:56,954
I can go get you a joint at Blacky's.

470
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:13,137
<i>I'd have done anything to please her.</i>

471
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,806
<i>Buy her pot, coke.</i>

472
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:23,480
<i>I could go to the top dogs</i>

473
00:36:23,647 --> 00:36:26,734
<i>to buy quality stuff at a good price</i>

474
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:30,487
<i>because the local boss</i>

475
00:36:30,613 --> 00:36:34,074
<i>was a former classmate: Blacky.</i>

476
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:36,410
Who is it?

477
00:36:36,493 --> 00:36:38,120
Rocket.

478
00:36:42,499 --> 00:36:44,668
- How are things down there?
- Fine.

479
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:47,046
- And the kids?
- Fine too.

480
00:36:47,129 --> 00:36:48,672
You want to buy or smoke a joint?

481
00:36:48,714 --> 00:36:50,716
- Buy.
- Come on in, buddy.

482
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:57,139
Who is it?

483
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:00,601
Who is it? Who is it?

484
00:37:04,605 --> 00:37:07,191
<i>This was Blacky's turf.</i>

485
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:10,527
<i>But it hadn't always been his.</i>

486
00:37:13,781 --> 00:37:16,033
- Hey, Blacky.
- Fuck, Li'l Dice.

487
00:37:16,116 --> 00:37:17,826
You show up like this at my place?

488
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:20,204
Who said it was your place?

<b>THE STORY OF THE APARTMENT</b>

490
00:37:24,206 --> 00:37:26,251
<i>Donna Zelia began selling drugs here</i>

491
00:37:26,335 --> 00:37:31,548
<i>in order to raise her daughters.</i>

492
00:37:31,715 --> 00:37:34,343
<i>She also gave away drugs to boys at times</i>

493
00:37:34,468 --> 00:37:36,804
<i>in return for special favors.</i>

494
00:37:37,471 --> 00:37:40,182
<i>Her favorite was "Big Boy."</i>

495
00:37:40,307 --> 00:37:42,685
<i>One day, he grew up very big!</i>

496
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:45,688
<i>Zelia's operation was so amateur</i>

497
00:37:45,813 --> 00:37:48,440
<i>that he had no trouble seizing it from her.</i>

498
00:37:49,274 --> 00:37:53,779
<i>Big Boy used the neighborhood kids
as dealers.</i>

499
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,864
What about my pot?

500
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,575
Stick it up your ass.

501
00:37:58,701 --> 00:38:01,203
<i>The best dealer</i>

502
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:05,582
<i>was Carrot.</i>

503
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,755
<i>He earned Big Boy's trust</i>

504
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,633
<i>and moved up to become a manager.</i>

505
00:38:15,384 --> 00:38:18,429
Blacky, 20 for us and 5 for you, okay?

506
00:38:20,472 --> 00:38:22,808
<i>One day a buddy of Carrot's showed up.</i>

507
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,145
<i>His name was Aristotle.</i>

508
00:38:27,813 --> 00:38:29,440
My wife needs an operation.

509
00:38:29,523 --> 00:38:33,986
<i>His family had taken Carrot in</i>

510
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:35,738
<i>when he was down and out.</i>

511
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,158
<i>He couldn't refuse to help a brother in need.</i>

512
00:38:39,241 --> 00:38:43,829
Here's the dope.
I want the dough no later than Friday.

513
00:38:43,912 --> 00:38:46,874
- You've bailed me out, brother.
- Friday.

514
00:38:47,207 --> 00:38:52,796
He's my buddy,
practically my brother, Big Boy.

515
00:38:53,255 --> 00:38:55,340
Give him another week.

516
00:38:57,468 --> 00:39:00,179
Either you kill him or I'll kill you.

517
00:39:00,262 --> 00:39:01,722
<i>Carrot had no choice.</i>

518
00:39:01,805 --> 00:39:04,808
I said Friday.

519
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:07,394
Don't do it, man.

520
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:10,898
<i>Carrot wanted to kill Big Boy,</i>

521
00:39:11,231 --> 00:39:12,441
<i>but it wasn't necessary.</i>

522
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:16,653
<i>Big Boy hadn't paid off the cops.
He died in jail.</i>

523
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,951
<i>Carrot took everything
that belonged to Big Boy,</i>

524
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,496
<i>but didn't want the apartment.</i>

525
00:39:26,872 --> 00:39:28,499
<i>The place was ill-fated.</i>

526
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,335
<i>Carrot gave it to his most trusted
dealer, Blacky.</i>

527
00:39:31,543 --> 00:39:32,669
Here, 150 bags.

528
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:36,298
Give me more.

529
00:39:36,423 --> 00:39:39,843
<i>That's how he took over the local trade.</i>

530
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,970
<i>But not for long.</i>

531
00:39:43,555 --> 00:39:44,681
Who is it?

532
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:47,017
Go see.

533
00:39:58,695 --> 00:40:00,739
- Hey, Blacky.
- Fuck, Li'l Dice.

534
00:40:00,906 --> 00:40:02,866
You show up like this at my place?

535
00:40:02,991 --> 00:40:05,327
Who said it was your place?

536
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:07,788
Yeah, who?

537
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:14,253
Something wrong, Li'l Dice?

538
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:17,172
Li'l Dice, my ass. My name is Li'l Ze now.

539
00:40:17,603 --> 00:40:20,000
<b>THE STORY OF LI'L ZE</b>

540
00:40:20,134 --> 00:40:23,428
<i>Li'l Ze had always wanted
to be the boss of the City of God,</i>

541
00:40:23,512 --> 00:40:27,391
<i>ever since he was called "Li'l Dice."</i>

542
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:34,898
They're having fun and not me?

543
00:40:44,783 --> 00:40:46,285
I want to get out of here.

544
00:40:47,828 --> 00:40:50,372
What, kid? Your friend took everything.

545
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:51,748
What do you want?

546
00:40:57,921 --> 00:41:01,300
<i>That night,
Li'l Dice satisfied his thirst to kill,</i>

547
00:41:01,383 --> 00:41:03,802
<i>though he knew
Shaggy would never forgive him.</i>

548
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:15,606
<i>To avoid being punished,
he left the City of God.</i>

549
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,443
<i>He had to work for peanuts.</i>

550
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,032
Yeah, Benny!

551
00:41:25,365 --> 00:41:27,784
<i>Li'l Dice and Benny managed well.</i>

552
00:41:29,953 --> 00:41:31,663
<i>They had the gift of crime.</i>

553
00:41:31,747 --> 00:41:34,750
- You have more money than me.
- It was my idea.

554
00:41:34,917 --> 00:41:38,378
<i>The only problem was running
into an older hoodlum</i>

555
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:39,796
<i>like my brother, Goose.</i>

556
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,256
Li'l Dice?

557
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,927
Shit, man, I thought you were a goner
at the motel.

558
00:41:45,385 --> 00:41:47,763
You're fucking loaded!

559
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:52,059
Don't Benny. That's our money.

560
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,895
Fuck you.
Cut the crap and give me the money.

561
00:41:54,978 --> 00:41:59,775
Benny, tell your brother Shaggy
that Shorty is squealing.

562
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,443
I'm leaving the slum.

563
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:05,447
Goose!

564
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:11,119
From Shaggy. You'll need it.

565
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:33,976
<i>From one hit to the next, Li'l Dice grew up.</i>

566
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:38,772
<i>At 18, he was the most respected hood
in the City of God.</i>

You're of age now, watch out!

568
00:42:40,983 --> 00:42:44,194
<i>He was one of the most wanted
robbers in Rio.</i>

569
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:59,418
Li'l Dice, how's it going?

570
00:42:59,501 --> 00:43:03,463
Happy birthday.
I'm so glad you've turned 18.

571
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:04,673
Get lost, Tuba!

572
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:06,383
Sorry, pal.

573
00:43:06,967 --> 00:43:08,093
Who's up for a beer?

574
00:43:08,176 --> 00:43:09,636
Give me a beer!

575
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,763
Didn't you see me, prick?

576
00:43:11,847 --> 00:43:13,807
- Sorry, man.
- Up yours!

577
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:19,062
The next time, I'll waste you, asshole.

578

<i>Li'l Dice was ready for anything.</i>

580
00:43:25,777 --> 00:43:27,696
I wanna talk.

581
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:29,406
<i>And he was itching to start.</i>

582
00:43:29,489 --> 00:43:30,824
Who are the fattest cats here?

583
00:43:31,158 --> 00:43:32,784
There are tons of them.

584
00:43:32,868 --> 00:43:35,454
Look at Jerry Adriani

585
00:43:35,787 --> 00:43:39,916
gold chain, snazzy clothes.

586
00:43:40,042 --> 00:43:42,419
Look at Pereira and the chick he's with.

587
00:43:42,461 --> 00:43:44,880
Bernice. She was my brother's girl.

588
00:43:44,921 --> 00:43:46,673
Check out his car.

589
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:49,926
Then there's Blacky. Covered in gold.

590
00:43:50,093 --> 00:43:53,722
Gold chain, gold watch.

591
00:43:54,181 --> 00:43:57,059
Look at Carrot and his car.

592
00:43:57,184 --> 00:43:59,061
They're all dealers.

593
00:43:59,186 --> 00:44:01,313
They're all fucking loaded.

594
00:44:01,396 --> 00:44:03,774
Holdups are bad business.

595
00:44:03,857 --> 00:44:06,735
- The big bucks are in drugs.
- I see.

596
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:08,862
Especially in selling coke.

597
00:44:08,945 --> 00:44:11,406
- But you need money.
- Not really.

598
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:14,868
We'll kill these clowns
and take over their business.

599
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:17,954
- When do we start?
- Now.

600
00:44:27,506 --> 00:44:31,635
Exu the Devil is the light that shines forth.

601
00:44:31,676 --> 00:44:34,179
He brought you here.

602
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:39,476
Why remain in the City of God,
where God has forgotten you?

603
00:44:40,769 --> 00:44:42,979
I know what you want.

604
00:44:43,438 --> 00:44:45,148
You want power.

605
00:44:45,232 --> 00:44:49,277
I have something which will give it to you.

606
00:44:50,946 --> 00:44:55,534
To change your fate,
I give you my protector, boy.

607
00:44:55,617 --> 00:44:58,537
But you mustn't fornicate with the amulet

608
00:44:59,454 --> 00:45:01,706
otherwise, you'll die.

609
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:05,252
The boy is no longer called Li'l Dice

610
00:45:05,877 --> 00:45:08,338
but Li'l Ze.

611
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:13,802
Li'l Ze will grow up.

612
00:45:14,594 --> 00:45:18,515
You'll stick with me, I'll stick with you.

613
00:45:29,734 --> 00:45:32,821
<i>Li'l Dice became Li'l Ze,
and he began to kill.</i>

614
00:45:34,114 --> 00:45:38,034
<i>He started one morning,
taking over Jerry Adriani's racket.</i>

615
00:45:38,452 --> 00:45:40,912
<i>By the night,</i>

616
00:45:42,122 --> 00:45:45,917
<i>almost all of the rackets
in the slum were his.</i>

617
00:45:46,626 --> 00:45:48,628
<i>The only business he didn't touch
was Carrot's</i>

618
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:51,214
<i>since he was a friend of Benny's.</i>

619
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:54,092
<i>All that was left was the apartment.</i>

620
00:45:54,176 --> 00:45:55,385
<i>But that would be easy.</i>

621
00:46:00,056 --> 00:46:01,308
Who is it?

622
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:04,895
Go see.

623
00:46:10,025 --> 00:46:11,902
- Hey, Blacky.
- Fuck. Li'l Dice.

624
00:46:12,027 --> 00:46:14,029
You show up like this at my place?

625
00:46:14,154 --> 00:46:16,823
Who said it was your place?

626
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,242
Something wrong, Li'l Dice?

627
00:46:19,326 --> 00:46:22,329
Li'l Dice, my ass. My name is Li'l Ze now.

628
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:23,622
Li'l Ze, see?

629
00:46:23,705 --> 00:46:27,083
- You're a goner, bastard.
- Don't kill him. He understands.

630
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:28,752
Right, Blacky?

631
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,255
It's all yours.

632
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,132
I don't want no trouble, okay?

633
00:46:34,257 --> 00:46:38,094
<i>I should have taken this chance
to avenge my brother's death.</i>

634
00:46:39,262 --> 00:46:43,016
You'll live, but you'll work for us.

635
00:46:43,099 --> 00:46:44,100
Understand?

636
00:46:44,184 --> 00:46:45,977
<i>That's easy to say.</i>

637
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:50,607
- Where are you going?
- He's clean. Li'l Ze.

638
00:46:51,274 --> 00:46:52,776
What's your name, kid?

639
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:56,696
- Rocket.
- He's Goose's brother.

640
00:46:56,821 --> 00:46:59,115
- Goose?
- The late Goose.

641
00:47:01,034 --> 00:47:03,828
Quick, kid. Run along.

642
00:47:04,579 --> 00:47:06,706
Tell everyone that this business

643
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:09,668
now belongs to Li'l Ze.
And that we'll be selling coke.

644
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:11,127
Got that?

645
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,005
Cocaine.

646
00:47:16,925 --> 00:47:19,844
- Where's the turf?
- Over there, on the left.

647
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:22,973
<i>Selling drugs is like any other business.</i>

648
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,350
<i>The supplier delivers the merchandise,</i>

649
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:28,228
<i>which is then packaged on the premises.</i>

650
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:32,315
<i>It's done in the assembly line.</i>

651
00:47:32,732 --> 00:47:35,068
<i>Boring as hell.</i>

652
00:47:35,151 --> 00:47:38,738
<i>Pot is wrapped up in "lids,"</i>

653
00:47:39,614 --> 00:47:43,034
<i>cocaine is put into packets,</i>

654
00:47:43,118 --> 00:47:47,038
<i>and then into bundles of 10 or 100.</i>

655
00:47:47,372 --> 00:47:49,624
<i>You can even make a career
in dealing drugs.</i>

656
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,711
<i>The kids start out as delivery boys.</i>

657
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:57,090
<i>They're paid to run errands</i>

658
00:47:57,215 --> 00:47:59,801
<i>and take messages.</i>

659
00:47:59,926 --> 00:48:01,803
<i>Then they become lookouts.</i>

660
00:48:01,928 --> 00:48:03,388
<i>If the police arrive,</i>

661
00:48:03,471 --> 00:48:05,390
<i>the kites disappear and everyone scrams.</i>

662
00:48:06,975 --> 00:48:10,812
<i>Later, you become a dealer or a "vapor."</i>

663
00:48:10,937 --> 00:48:13,773
<i>When the heat's on,
the "vapor" quickly evaporates.</i>

664
00:48:13,898 --> 00:48:17,819
<i>Moving up the ladder,
you have the "soldier."</i>

665
00:48:18,361 --> 00:48:23,325
<i>And if the guy is good at math,
he can become a manager,</i>

666
00:48:23,366 --> 00:48:25,368
<i>the boss's right-hand man.</i>

667
00:48:27,203 --> 00:48:30,540
<i>The police receive their part
and don't make trouble.</i>

668
00:48:33,168 --> 00:48:35,795
<i>Since Li'l Ze killed off all of his enemies,</i>

669
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:38,965
<i>there were no shoot-outs in the City of God.</i>

670
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:40,717
<i>You could drive there.</i>

671
00:48:41,384 --> 00:48:45,138
<i>The playboys felt safe
buying their drugs there.</i>

672
00:48:46,222 --> 00:48:48,975
<i>The City teemed with addicts</i>

673
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:50,935
<i>and Li'l Ze grew rich.</i>

674
00:48:57,525 --> 00:49:00,445
I can't decide which to wear.

675
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:02,238
This one's cool.

676
00:49:02,697 --> 00:49:06,242
<i>If dealing were legal,
Li'l Ze would have been man of the year.</i>

677
00:49:07,661 --> 00:49:08,662
Making fun of me?

678
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,249
<i>But things were risky for me.
I was afraid of him.</i>

679
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:16,002
<i>And he was everywhere.</i>

680
00:49:16,127 --> 00:49:17,462
What a drag this guy is.

681
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:19,964
<i>Whenever I wanted to smoke a joint</i>

682
00:49:20,048 --> 00:49:22,550
<i>I had to go see Carrot.</i>

683
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:29,391
Half a lid.

684
00:49:29,432 --> 00:49:30,684
Thanks.

685
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:35,188
<i>But it was worth it.
I only smoked with Angelica.</i>

686
00:49:37,357 --> 00:49:38,775
<i>She and Tiago had split up,</i>

687
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,443
<i>so I made my move.</i>

688
00:49:40,694 --> 00:49:43,113
<i>I was about to win her over.</i>

689
00:49:43,154 --> 00:49:45,156
These pictures are really great.

690
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,200
You think so?

691
00:49:48,284 --> 00:49:49,911
I look good here.

692
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:53,123
- You look beautiful everywhere.
- I'm serious.

693
00:49:53,164 --> 00:49:54,207
Me too.

694
00:49:57,293 --> 00:50:00,296
<i>A setting sun, a deserted beach,</i>

695
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,132
a <i>long kiss,</i>

696
00:50:02,716 --> 00:50:04,968
<i>I was sure this was it.</i>

697
00:50:06,344 --> 00:50:08,346
<i>But the Runts arrived.</i>

698
00:50:09,431 --> 00:50:12,183
Can I have a toke?

699
00:50:18,273 --> 00:50:19,399
Here.

700
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:23,445
I'm going. See you later.

701
00:50:25,321 --> 00:50:27,282
Hold on, Angelica!

702
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:31,286
- Your joint, man.
- Keep it.

703
00:50:31,327 --> 00:50:32,954
What a cool guy.

704
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:41,504
<i>That was my first run-in with the Runts.</i>

705
00:50:47,427 --> 00:50:49,095
Steak and fries, Benny.

706
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:50,472
Great! Here.

707
00:50:56,394 --> 00:50:58,229
A tip for you.

708
00:50:58,396 --> 00:51:00,064
Really? Thanks.

709
00:51:00,148 --> 00:51:01,399
- Want to eat something?
- No.

710
00:51:05,612 --> 00:51:07,405
Want to trade this watch?

711
00:51:07,489 --> 00:51:09,532
<i>After Angelica left him,</i>

712
00:51:09,949 --> 00:51:11,993
<i>Tiago began snorting more and more.</i>

713
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:13,745
ls it your grandfather's?

714
00:51:13,995 --> 00:51:15,246
No, my dad's.

715
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:16,664
<i>When a guy is really hooked,</i>

716
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:20,043
<i>he ends up in the hands of the dealer.</i>

717
00:51:20,084 --> 00:51:21,920
- Two bags of ten.
- One of ten.

718
00:51:22,003 --> 00:51:23,004
Okay, one bag.

719
00:51:23,129 --> 00:51:25,548
<i>For Tiago, it was different.</i>

720
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:28,009
Watch out!

721
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:29,886
Sorry, godfather.

722
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:33,056
Godfather, my ass. Did I baptize your kids?

723
00:51:33,139 --> 00:51:34,140
I'm sorry.

724
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:35,683
Now beat it.

725
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:41,564
Blacky, lend me your bike.

726
00:52:06,506 --> 00:52:08,258
Hey, want to race?

727
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:10,260
Where to?

728
00:52:10,343 --> 00:52:12,262
Up to the highway.

729
00:52:13,304 --> 00:52:15,598
- Okay.
- Ready? Go!

730
00:52:38,454 --> 00:52:39,706
Pretty tough, wasn't it?

731
00:52:40,081 --> 00:52:42,041
Yeah, you're good.

732
00:52:42,542 --> 00:52:44,752
Where'd you buy those sneakers?

733
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:47,505
- Not far from here.
- The shirt, as well?

734
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:50,174
- No, uptown.
- Cool.

735
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,176
It's a designer shirt.

736
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:55,054
If I give you money can you buy me one?

737
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:57,056
Shorts and a shirt?

738
00:53:00,268 --> 00:53:01,686
Buy whatever you can.

739
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:07,317
- What size are you?
- Measure me.

740
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,028
- With what, man?
- Shit, with your hand.

741
00:53:12,113 --> 00:53:14,449
Shoe size?

742
00:53:14,574 --> 00:53:15,992
Turn around.

743
00:53:23,291 --> 00:53:24,667
Hey, Benny!

744
00:53:26,294 --> 00:53:28,171
You got the threads?

745
00:53:31,132 --> 00:53:33,927
- Just one pair of pants?
- No, there's more.

746
00:53:39,974 --> 00:53:42,060
- You like it?
- Yeah.

747
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:44,062
There's some change.

748
00:53:44,604 --> 00:53:46,314
Keep it.

749
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:49,025
Cool.

750
00:53:55,114 --> 00:53:57,700
This is Benny.

751
00:54:00,244 --> 00:54:03,665
- This is Rocket.
- Hi. I know him.

752
00:54:28,356 --> 00:54:30,233
I've become a playboy.

753
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:37,156
Hey, gangsters, listen to this.

754
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:38,783
Watch out.

755
00:54:39,325 --> 00:54:42,578
Groovies shake their asses
before laying a big one.

756
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:47,959
Oh, yeah?

757
00:54:54,716 --> 00:54:56,092
Fuck off, you bastards!

758
00:54:56,592 --> 00:54:58,302
Making fun of me?

759
00:54:59,595 --> 00:55:00,805
Asshole!

760
00:55:16,487 --> 00:55:18,656
Benny, didn't I tell you to shoot Carrot?

761
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,575
He's endangering the slum.

762
00:55:20,616 --> 00:55:24,579
- Cool it. Go talk to him.
- I'm going to kill that fucker.

763
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:27,999
- Stop trying to wipe out everyone.
- I'm gonna kill him.

764
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:32,628
Don't worry, Angelica.
The guys in here are cool.

765
00:55:32,754 --> 00:55:35,006
Sure, I'm not worried.

766
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:39,469
You gonna dance, Benny?
What about Carrot?

767
00:55:39,635 --> 00:55:42,930
Go talk to the guy.

768
00:55:44,348 --> 00:55:47,435
<i>Benny was the coolest hood
in the City of God.</i>

769
00:55:48,019 --> 00:55:50,813
<i>He gave away pot, paid for drinks.</i>

770
00:55:51,814 --> 00:55:54,859
<i>Li'l Ze was the opposite.
He has one obsession,</i>

771
00:55:54,942 --> 00:55:57,153
<i>to be the boss of the slum.</i>

772
00:55:57,236 --> 00:56:00,573
<i>He wanted an excuse to take over
Carrot's racket.</i>

773
00:56:00,782 --> 00:56:02,325
- Hey, Carrot.
- What's up?

774
00:56:02,408 --> 00:56:06,037
You shouldn't let the Runts
do holdups in the slum.

775
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:10,333
You look after your section,
I'll look after mine.

776
00:56:10,416 --> 00:56:14,378
Got that? I'm gonna get a drink.

777
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:26,474
- Hey, Rocket! How's it going?
- Great.

778
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:29,143
- Hey, Benny!
- How's it going?

779
00:56:30,686 --> 00:56:33,606
- Hey, Tiago. How are you?
- Good.

780
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:36,734
- May I?
- Sure.

781
00:56:36,818 --> 00:56:38,319
Want to dance?

782
00:56:42,448 --> 00:56:44,659
Is it okay at your place?

783
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,285
No problem.

784
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:49,872
My parents are out.
You'll be all alone with her.

785
00:56:49,914 --> 00:56:52,041
You can lose your virginity tonight.

786
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,335
Not so loud, man!

787
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:56,379
Everyone will hear.

788
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:59,882
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.

789
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:01,425
Shit!

790
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:04,303
Nothing's happening.

791
00:57:11,811 --> 00:57:16,023
Look, man, I know the Runts
are associated with you.

792
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:19,235
Think I'm a sucker, you little brat?

793
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:22,280
- You want to take my racket?
- I want to talk to you

794
00:57:22,363 --> 00:57:25,283
- because you're fucking useless.
- Get your hand away!

795
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:27,451
The Runts are screwing up
our security, man.

796
00:57:27,535 --> 00:57:29,829
Give the baby his bottle.

797
00:57:29,954 --> 00:57:33,374
Carrot, just ask the kids to cool it, okay?

798
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:36,544
Carrot's useless.
He lets the Runts do holdups in his section.

799
00:57:36,669 --> 00:57:38,379
The police come around

800
00:57:38,504 --> 00:57:39,755
and that's bad for business.

801
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:43,301
I'll do it only because I like you.

802
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:47,763
But you need to change that baby's diaper.

803
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:49,599
I'll show you who's the baby.

804
00:57:49,765 --> 00:57:55,521
Tell the kids that in my slum
no one robs or rapes!

805
00:57:55,646 --> 00:57:57,356
No wonder you're "Little" Ze!

806
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:03,946
<i>The Runts were kids
who didn't respect the laws</i>

807
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:05,823
<i>of the slum.</i>

808
00:58:05,948 --> 00:58:08,910
<i>They would mug residents,
hold up bakeries</i>

809
00:58:09,035 --> 00:58:11,454
<i>especially in Carrot's section.</i>

810
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:15,875
What are you doing?

811
00:58:19,503 --> 00:58:20,963
You rob me all the time!

812
00:58:21,005 --> 00:58:23,132
<i>But they didn't know</i>

813
00:58:23,382 --> 00:58:27,053
<i>that the City had a boss now.</i>

814
00:58:28,387 --> 00:58:30,514
THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING US

815
00:58:30,598 --> 00:58:33,601
<i>The City had become much safer</i>

816
00:58:33,726 --> 00:58:35,394
<i>for residents.</i>

817
00:58:35,978 --> 00:58:38,397
<i>There were hardly any holdups now.</i>

818
00:58:39,065 --> 00:58:41,359
<i>You just had to go see Li'l Ze.</i>

819
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:43,819
- Let's go.
- Don't hurt the Runts.

820
00:58:43,903 --> 00:58:45,696
I won't touch them.

821
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:52,161
- Hi, Steak.
- How's it going, Li'l Ze?

822
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:55,998
- Want to take a walk, Steak?
- With you? Hold on.

823
00:58:57,833 --> 00:59:00,336
Mom, I'm going outwith my friends.

824
00:59:13,015 --> 00:59:15,643
That's the best chicken I ever ate.

825
00:59:15,851 --> 00:59:17,645
The old guy was scared shitless.

826
00:59:17,728 --> 00:59:19,647
I was fucking cracking up.

827
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:23,484
- Feeling sorry for him?
- You're crazy, man!

828
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:34,829
Why not stick up a bank or a supermarket?

829
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:37,039
Peanuts. Drugs are where it's at.

830
00:59:37,164 --> 00:59:39,458
Yeah, selling drugs.

831
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:41,085
You shut up, loser!

832
00:59:41,168 --> 00:59:44,630
I told you, you wanna be a criminal,
start out as a delivery boy.

833
00:59:44,755 --> 00:59:46,340
You want to be a delivery boy?

834
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:49,719
It's a rip-off.
It takes a long time to move up.

835
00:59:52,013 --> 00:59:55,975
He's right. You have to wait till
an older guy gets killed to move up.

836
00:59:56,058 --> 00:59:59,562
I don't want to wait till some guy croaks.
I'm gonna do what Li'l Ze did.

837
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:02,273
- I'm gonna wipe them all out.
- That's right. The boss is here.

838
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:04,066
Talking about me, kid?

839
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:10,906
Come back, you brat!

840
01:00:15,077 --> 01:00:17,121
They're quick, those kids.

841
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:21,042
They run fast.

842
01:00:21,167 --> 01:00:22,835
They're all gone except you.

843
01:00:25,087 --> 01:00:26,255
Any others?

844
01:00:34,055 --> 01:00:36,849
You're gonna pay for the ones that escaped.

845
01:00:36,974 --> 01:00:40,853
You choose.
Shall I shoot you in the hand or foot?

846
01:00:41,729 --> 01:00:43,689
Come on, choose! Hand or foot?

847
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,941
Choose, for fuck's sake!

848
01:00:49,111 --> 01:00:51,489
Hand or foot?

849
01:00:56,410 --> 01:00:58,496
Come on, choose!

850
01:00:59,163 --> 01:01:02,333
- Hand.
- The little hand, eh?

851
01:01:11,509 --> 01:01:13,886
- Cool! You got him!
- That's right.

852
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:16,430
Hey, Steak 'n' Fries,

853
01:01:16,555 --> 01:01:19,016
let's see what you're made of.

854
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:22,520
Choose and then kill one of them.

855
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:24,855
Leave it. I'll do it.

856
01:01:24,939 --> 01:01:26,774
Butt out, Tuba. This is for him.

857
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:31,070
Go on, Steak.

858
01:01:31,445 --> 01:01:33,155
Go on, choose one and shoot.

859
01:01:33,197 --> 01:01:35,741
- One of the two, Steak.
- Kill him already.

860
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:38,327
Come on, I haven't got all day.

861
01:01:38,411 --> 01:01:41,163
C'mon, Steak. Choose now. Kill one of them.

862
01:01:41,288 --> 01:01:42,998
Don't chicken out, lil' girl.

863
01:01:44,458 --> 01:01:46,710
Go on, Steak. I don't have all day.

864
01:01:48,087 --> 01:01:51,090
C'mon, Steak.
I want to see what you're made of, now.

865
01:01:57,930 --> 01:02:00,349
Well done!

866
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:02,143
You did it.

867
01:02:03,727 --> 01:02:05,896
You're one of us.

868
01:02:06,021 --> 01:02:08,190
Very good, Steak.

869
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:17,366
Get up, brat. Go back to your rat hole.

870
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:18,951
Without limping!

871
01:02:19,034 --> 01:02:22,079
Tell your buddies that no one
robs in Li'l Ze's slum.

872
01:02:22,163 --> 01:02:24,373
Go now. And no limping, okay?

873
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,667
COOI, Li'l Ze.

874
01:02:44,226 --> 01:02:47,813
<i>While Li'l Ze was winning
the respect of the residents,</i>

875
01:02:48,689 --> 01:02:51,192
<i>Benny was winning Angelica's heart.</i>

876
01:02:52,026 --> 01:02:56,363
<i>As for me, I was still a virgin,
single and broke.</i>

877
01:02:56,989 --> 01:02:58,574

<b>A SUCKER'S LIFE</b>

879
01:03:03,287 --> 01:03:07,124
<i>I had to take a job in a supermarket.</i>

880
01:03:07,249 --> 01:03:09,710
<i>I worked long hours for chickenfeed.</i>

881
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:11,879
<i>I wanted to be laid off</i>

882
01:03:12,004 --> 01:03:16,175
<i>so I could buy a camera
with the severance pay.</i>

883
01:03:17,176 --> 01:03:19,887
<i>But things didn't work out that way.</i>

884
01:03:23,349 --> 01:03:25,976
- It's the guy on the beach.
- Hey, bro!

885
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:29,104
- Still smoking good stuff?
- Yeah.

886
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:30,940
That guy's too cool.

01:03:30,981 --> 01:03:33,859
Hey, kid. Come here. Lift up your shirt.

888
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:41,909
We give these slum kids a chance
and they don't appreciate it.

889
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:45,037
- What about my severance pay?
- What severance pay?

890

<i>That fucking manager thought
I was part of the gang.</i>

You're fired for serious misconduct.

892
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:55,047
Get out. Immediately!

893
01:03:55,297 --> 01:03:58,801
<i>I didn't get a single cent!</i>

894
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:14,733
<i>It was like a message from God,</i>

<i>"Honesty doesn't pay, sucker."</i>

<b>FLIRTING WITH CRIME</b>

The bus sure took a long time to come.

898
01:04:35,879 --> 01:04:38,132
I should already be at work.

899
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:41,385
Shit, hide that gun. Are you nuts?

900
01:04:41,594 --> 01:04:43,887
It was Goose's. It's broken anyway.

901
01:04:43,971 --> 01:04:46,932
The company runs few buses on this line.

902
01:04:47,057 --> 01:04:48,851
It's never anyone's fault.

903
01:04:48,976 --> 01:04:53,814
It's always someone else.
It's my grandfather's fault.

I know that guy.

907
01:05:02,906 --> 01:05:05,868
He lives in the City. He'll recognize us.

908
01:05:06,035 --> 01:05:08,537
So? He couldn't care less
if we take his boss's money.

01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:10,331
Okay. Let's go.

Well, boys?
Aren't you from the City of God?

01:05:17,212 --> 01:05:18,380
Yeah.

912
01:05:18,464 --> 01:05:21,800
I'll let one of you through without paying.

913
01:05:26,305 --> 01:05:28,182
You should study

914
01:05:28,223 --> 01:05:30,517
so you can get out of the slum.

915
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:32,936
It's too full of cops and hoodlums.

916
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:34,188
Did you study?

917
01:05:34,229 --> 01:05:37,358
I was in school and in the army.

918
01:05:37,524 --> 01:05:40,527
I was the best marksman in my barracks.

919
01:05:41,236 --> 01:05:43,822
This job was all I could find afterwards.

920
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:47,743
But I do karate. If I'm hired somewhere,

921
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:50,162
I'll leave the slum.

922

- Goodbye.
- Thanks.

01:06:08,347 --> 01:06:09,598
See you.

930
01:06:14,937 --> 01:06:17,439
I couldn't do it. He was such a cool guy.

01:06:17,481 --> 01:06:20,234
Yeah, totally. That's Gelson's brother.

01:06:32,538 --> 01:06:34,957
I don't know. "This is a holdup."

Here's my number.

937

- You like soul or groovy parties?
- Soul.

<i>That didn't work either.</i>

939
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:47,052
<i>The counter girl was just too foxy.
And she flirted with me.</i>

01:06:47,428 --> 01:06:48,512
Will you call me?

941
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:53,434
I couldn't pull a gun on her.
She was such a cool girl.

942
01:06:53,559 --> 01:06:54,977
Yeah, I agree.

943
01:06:58,021 --> 01:06:59,356
Excuse me.

944
01:07:02,359 --> 01:07:05,404
I'm lost. How do I get to Barra?

945
01:07:05,487 --> 01:07:06,488
- To Barra?
- Yes.

946

<i>I thought,

You're kidding.

949
01:07:13,412 --> 01:07:16,415
- You're a lifesaver.
- That's right.

950
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:21,503
<i>Because no one from Sao Paulo
could ever be cool.</i>

951

The body's over here.

952
01:07:31,305 --> 01:07:32,431
We found it, Chief.

953
01:07:32,556 --> 01:07:34,683
The forensic expert!

954
01:07:50,532 --> 01:07:53,577
- Not a pretty sight, eh?
- You said it.

955
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:55,621
- What a great singer.
- You like him?

956
01:07:55,954 --> 01:07:57,915
I love music. What about you?

957
01:07:57,998 --> 01:08:00,292
Tell me, do you also like pot?

958
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:06,381
I can't say I've never tried it.

959
01:08:06,548 --> 01:08:09,301
The devil recognizes his own.

960
01:08:11,136 --> 01:08:13,263
Do you have papers?

961
01:08:13,388 --> 01:08:15,349
I think so.

962
01:08:15,474 --> 01:08:18,018
I have some.

963
01:08:19,561 --> 01:08:22,564
<i>I'd always been an ace at rolling a joint.</i>

964
01:08:22,689 --> 01:08:24,983
<i>If I 'd had the same skill with girls,</i>

965
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:29,530
<i>I'd never have lost so many chances
to lose my virginity.</i>

966
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:34,701
Sao Paulo guy, you're really cool.

967
01:08:35,035 --> 01:08:36,578
Thanks, bro.

968
01:08:36,745 --> 01:08:39,665
What did they use?

969
01:08:39,998 --> 01:08:42,501
A club or a rock.

970
01:08:42,626 --> 01:08:44,294
And the Child?

971
01:08:44,419 --> 01:08:47,297
- Untouched.
- Thank goodness.

972
01:08:47,422 --> 01:08:49,091
How long ago?

973
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:53,178
About four hours.

974
01:08:53,303 --> 01:08:56,348
- Can we take it away?
- Go ahead.

975
01:08:56,473 --> 01:08:58,517
The murderer

976
01:08:58,767 --> 01:09:01,728
has to be from the City of God.

977
01:09:19,621 --> 01:09:21,748
You bastard! You motherfucker!

978
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:27,921
Did you have to kill your chick in the slum?

979
01:09:28,005 --> 01:09:29,882
The place is crawling with cops now!

980
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:31,258
Come on, Li'l Ze.

981
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,801
Come on? Fuck you!

982
01:09:32,885 --> 01:09:35,762
I had to avenge my honor.

983
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:39,474
Her family's turned me in.
You won't have any problems.

984
01:09:39,558 --> 01:09:41,810
The cops are everywhere because of you.

985
01:09:41,852 --> 01:09:43,228
You're dead meat, asshole.

986
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:46,565
Let up, Li'l Ze.
You've punished him enough.

987
01:09:46,648 --> 01:09:48,483
You know the law.

988
01:09:48,567 --> 01:09:51,653
Anyone who kills in my slum
has to die as an example.

989
01:09:51,695 --> 01:09:54,656
That was his business, Li'l Ze.

990
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:57,284
Listen, you son of a bitch,
get out of the slum.

991
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:59,119
You showed no respect, understand?

992
01:10:03,123 --> 01:10:04,207
You know what, Benny?

993
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:08,211
You're too nice.
If you raise a snake, expect to get bitten.

994
01:10:08,295 --> 01:10:10,505
He wasn't worth shit.

995
01:10:11,506 --> 01:10:13,008
A dirty traitor.

996
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:14,468
Shut up, Tuba.

997
01:10:14,509 --> 01:10:16,970
I'm going for a walk with my girl.

998
01:10:17,179 --> 01:10:19,556
Okay, be careful.

999
01:10:19,681 --> 01:10:21,433
When things calm down,

1000
01:10:21,516 --> 01:10:24,686
we'll get back to our business
with Carrot, okay?

1001
01:10:30,525 --> 01:10:32,819
You need a girlfriend, Li'l Ze.

1002
01:10:53,715 --> 01:10:55,926
Know what I'm thinking, Benny?

1003
01:10:56,802 --> 01:10:58,595
That I'm so sexy?

1004
01:10:59,429 --> 01:11:02,766
That, too, but I mean,
you know what we could do?

1005
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:04,184
Make love again.

1006
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:05,852
I'm serious.

1007
01:11:07,187 --> 01:11:11,525
We could go away from here.
This violence sucks.

1008
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:14,403
Go where?

1009
01:11:15,278 --> 01:11:16,697
To a farm.

1010
01:11:19,157 --> 01:11:21,952
We're really hippies at heart, aren't we?

1011
01:11:24,162 --> 01:11:25,747
A farm?

1012
01:11:29,751 --> 01:11:31,712
Peace and love?

1013
01:11:51,899 --> 01:11:56,560
<b>BENNY'S FAREWELL</b>

1014
01:12:05,662 --> 01:12:08,957
<i>Benny was just too cool
to go on being a hoodlum.</i>

1015
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:12,961
<i>He succeeded in getting everybody
together for his goodbye party.</i>

1016
01:12:13,045 --> 01:12:14,588
<i>The gangs-</i>

1017
01:12:15,922 --> 01:12:17,382
<i>The soul crowd.</i>

1018
01:12:22,012 --> 01:12:23,472
<i>The religious crowd.</i>

1019
01:12:23,597 --> 01:12:27,642
One day, I'll go to church.

1020
01:12:27,809 --> 01:12:29,686
<i>The samba crowd.</i>

1021
01:12:33,815 --> 01:12:35,609
<i>The groovy crowd.</i>

1022
01:12:38,487 --> 01:12:42,240
<i>And Li'l Ze,
who had never danced in his life.</i>

1023
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:04,554
Want to dance with me?

1024
01:13:04,846 --> 01:13:06,681
Want to dance with me?

1025
01:13:06,723 --> 01:13:09,643
- I didn't hear...
- Want to dance?

1026
01:13:09,684 --> 01:13:12,020
No, thank you. I'm with someone.

1027
01:13:26,868 --> 01:13:28,328
Hey, Rocket!

1028
01:13:42,592 --> 01:13:45,470
Come, I want to talk to you, buddy.

1029
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:49,224
You can't just split with that chick.

1030
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:50,392
Why not?

1031
01:13:50,475 --> 01:13:54,396
I'm gonna go live on a farm,
smoke pot, listen to rock.

1032
01:13:54,688 --> 01:13:58,441
You want to throw away everything
we've accomplished together for that bitch?

1033
01:13:59,276 --> 01:14:01,695
She's not a bitch. She's my girl.

1034
01:14:02,571 --> 01:14:05,031
We'll take over Carrot's business.
It'll be yours.

1035
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:07,033
Leave Carrot alone. He's a good guy.

1036
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:08,451
He's a motherfucker!

1037
01:14:08,535 --> 01:14:10,537
See? Everyone's a motherfucker to you.

1038
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:11,913
That's why I'm leaving.

1039
01:14:11,997 --> 01:14:15,500
I'm your friend, but I'm getting out.

1040
01:14:16,126 --> 01:14:18,336
You got to understand, I have to go.

1041
01:14:19,504 --> 01:14:23,300
I love you, man, but I've had enough.

1042
01:15:23,026 --> 01:15:25,695
Motherfucker, let's see if you have any balls.

1043
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:26,988
What is this?

1044
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:29,824
You want to die? Fuck off, bitch!

1045
01:15:29,866 --> 01:15:32,994
Strip, nigger. I want to see your ass.

1046
01:15:33,036 --> 01:15:35,830
Hurry UP!

1047
01:15:35,956 --> 01:15:37,540
Take it all off! Now!

1048
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:41,127
I want to see your ass.

1049
01:15:41,461 --> 01:15:44,005
Come on, faggot!

1050
01:15:44,756 --> 01:15:46,007
Let's go, nigger!

1051
01:15:54,516 --> 01:15:56,935
Show your ass to everyone!

1052
01:15:57,477 --> 01:15:59,187
Please.

1053
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:04,025
Strip, damn it!

1054
01:16:04,442 --> 01:16:05,860
Hurry it up!

1055
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,500
What's up, Benny?

1056
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:22,335
This camera for a bag of coke?

1057
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:24,087
I don't deal anymore.

1058
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:27,048
Come on, do it for me. You're my friend.

1059
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:29,718
- Is it stolen?
- It's okay, it's my dad's.

1060
01:16:29,884 --> 01:16:31,928
Your dad's?

1061
01:16:34,055 --> 01:16:36,558
Give it to Li'l Ze.

1062
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:38,935
Rocket would love this camera.

1063
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:42,230
- Yeah, here.
- Great.

1064
01:17:09,716 --> 01:17:11,051
Here I am!

1065
01:17:12,093 --> 01:17:14,054
- You want to be a photographer?
- Yeah.

1066
01:17:14,095 --> 01:17:15,930
Here's a present.

1067
01:17:16,097 --> 01:17:19,309
Shit, dude! This is great!

1068
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:21,936
Now move your ass.

1069
01:17:22,103 --> 01:17:25,565
Shake it!

1070
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:45,585
You'll take some great pictures.

1071
01:17:48,129 --> 01:17:49,798
Give me that.

1072
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:58,098
- Give me back the camera!
- No!

1073
01:17:58,139 --> 01:18:00,475
What's your problem? Are you crazy?

1074
01:18:38,596 --> 01:18:40,682
They've killed Benny!

1075
01:18:42,308 --> 01:18:45,353
Fuck! Call an ambulance!

1076
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,731
Where's the motherfucker who did it?

1077
01:18:49,649 --> 01:18:51,484
Ze, Benny is dead.

1078
01:18:51,526 --> 01:18:53,736
Call a doctor!

1079
01:19:00,201 --> 01:19:03,037
Get out of her, bitch! It's your fault!

1080
01:19:05,665 --> 01:19:07,125
Motherfucker!

1081
01:19:33,318 --> 01:19:35,278
Where's Carrot?

1082
01:19:35,403 --> 01:19:37,113
Blacky's here.

1083
01:19:39,657 --> 01:19:41,868
He's in trouble.

1084
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:45,997
I'm fucked.

1085
01:19:46,122 --> 01:19:48,333
- Why?
- I'm fucked.

1086
01:19:48,666 --> 01:19:49,876
And you are, too.

1087
01:19:50,001 --> 01:19:51,920
I think I killed Benny.

1088
01:19:52,003 --> 01:19:53,880
Li'l Ze's coming to take your place.

1089
01:19:54,088 --> 01:19:56,674
We can get him. He's in the dance hall.

1090
01:19:56,758 --> 01:19:58,134
You killed Benny?

1091
01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:02,847
I didn't mean to. He moved.
I was aiming at Li'l Ze.

1092
01:20:03,139 --> 01:20:04,891
Come on, let's go.

1093
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:06,309
Blacky.

1094
01:20:07,352 --> 01:20:09,938
You killed the coolest hood
in the City of God.

1095
01:20:09,979 --> 01:20:11,856
Let's go get Li'l Ze.

1096
01:20:20,573 --> 01:20:25,411
<i>Carrot knew that without Benny
only a miracle could save his business.</i>

1097
01:20:25,453 --> 01:20:27,288
We're fucked, man.

1098
01:20:38,007 --> 01:20:39,926
<i>But what better place</i>

1099
01:20:40,885 --> 01:20:44,681
<i>for a miracle to happen
than in the City of God?</i>

1100
01:20:46,975 --> 01:20:48,851
Look who's here. My sugar babe.

1101
01:20:48,977 --> 01:20:50,645
- Let me by.
- Give me a kiss, girl.

1102
01:20:50,728 --> 01:20:55,316
Let me by, please.
Have you seen what you look like?

1103
01:20:57,068 --> 01:20:59,153
Come on, Li'l Ze.

1104
01:21:07,912 --> 01:21:10,790
Hi, honey. Everything okay, baby?

1105
01:21:18,631 --> 01:21:21,968
<i>The problem was simple.</i>

1106
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:23,386
<i>Li'l Ze was ugly.</i>

1107
01:21:23,678 --> 01:21:25,430
<i>Knockout Ned was handsome.</i>

1108
01:21:25,513 --> 01:21:27,682
<i>Knockout Ned could get any girl.</i>

1109
01:21:27,849 --> 01:21:31,477
<i>Li'l Ze had to pay or use force.</i>

1110
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:36,065
<i>It was a duel between
the handsome good guy</i>

1111
01:21:36,441 --> 01:21:38,484
<i>and the ugly bad guy-</i>

1112
01:21:38,526 --> 01:21:40,570
Let me go!

1113
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:45,199
Just enjoy it.

1114
01:21:52,165 --> 01:21:54,876
There's no use fighting. You're mine now.

1115
01:21:58,129 --> 01:22:01,132
Hey, faggot, your broad's really hot!

1116
01:22:33,289 --> 01:22:35,625
I can't even look her in the face now.

1117
01:22:45,551 --> 01:22:49,055
Why didn't that fucker kill me?

1118
01:22:53,351 --> 01:22:54,477
Hold on.

1119
01:22:55,144 --> 01:22:57,355
Why didn't I kill that fucker?

1120
01:22:58,147 --> 01:22:59,982
Let's go back.

1121
01:23:00,066 --> 01:23:02,694
- What about Carrot?
- We'll get back to him.

1122
01:23:02,777 --> 01:23:04,153
You gonna kill him?

1123
01:23:08,282 --> 01:23:10,076
Knockout Ned, your chick's a slut.

1124
01:23:10,201 --> 01:23:12,161
Come out, motherfucker!

1125
01:23:12,286 --> 01:23:14,122
Come out, you loser!

1126
01:23:14,288 --> 01:23:15,957
Take it easy.

1127
01:23:17,583 --> 01:23:19,127
I'm going out. Let me go.

1128
01:23:19,293 --> 01:23:21,879
Gelson! Come back, son!

1129
01:23:48,156 --> 01:23:51,826
This doesn't concern you, kid.
We're here for your brother.

1130
01:23:51,993 --> 01:23:55,496
Let's talk, we can work it out.
My brother's a peaceful guy.

1131
01:23:55,663 --> 01:23:59,000
Is he too good-looking to come talk to me?
Call him.

1132
01:23:59,083 --> 01:24:00,293
He hasn't done anything.

1133
01:24:00,752 --> 01:24:02,336
You know who I am?

1134
01:24:02,378 --> 01:24:07,341
- Li'l Ze, man.
- He's Li'l Ze.

1135
01:24:08,009 --> 01:24:09,635
Call that motherfucker!

1136
01:24:09,677 --> 01:24:11,179
Go on, man.

1137
01:24:19,103 --> 01:24:20,563
Calm down. I'll call him.

1138
01:24:23,357 --> 01:24:24,525
My arm!

1139
01:24:55,681 --> 01:24:58,392
I hurt my arm. Carrot will have to wait.

1140
01:24:58,476 --> 01:25:00,436
That loser got what he deserved.

1141
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:02,605
Let's go!

1142
01:25:26,629 --> 01:25:28,923
Gelson.

1143
01:25:31,092 --> 01:25:33,261
That bastard killed my brother.

1144
01:25:33,427 --> 01:25:36,556
I can't let that go.

1145
01:25:54,615 --> 01:25:56,242
Want a gun?

1146
01:26:00,788 --> 01:26:02,123
My son.

1147
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:05,334
Calm down, Mom.

1148
01:26:06,794 --> 01:26:09,046
Please, Mom.

1149
01:26:20,016 --> 01:26:22,143
Do it right, asshole.

1150
01:26:22,643 --> 01:26:24,020
There's no other way.

1151
01:26:24,103 --> 01:26:26,480
How'd I let that loser hit me?

1152
01:26:26,564 --> 01:26:28,566
Shit, that's some hole.

1153
01:26:59,347 --> 01:27:02,308
- It's as if we were brothers.
- Shut up.

1154
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:05,436
Both of us hurt in the arm.
You by one brother, me the other.

1155
01:27:05,519 --> 01:27:07,939
It would be really funny if we were brothers.

1156
01:27:08,022 --> 01:27:12,610
That Knockout Ned's not bad, eh?

1157
01:27:12,693 --> 01:27:16,405
He came out of nowhere.

1158
01:27:17,323 --> 01:27:20,451
Shut up, Tuba! You're a fucking pain!

1159
01:27:28,709 --> 01:27:33,130
<i>It was as if the City of God
had suddenly found a hero.</i>

1160
01:27:33,339 --> 01:27:34,882
God bless you, son.

1161
01:27:35,299 --> 01:27:39,345
That kid was just asking to be killed.

1162
01:27:40,388 --> 01:27:42,139
Well done.

1163
01:27:43,641 --> 01:27:46,185
You did a good job.

1164
01:27:46,727 --> 01:27:48,729
You'd better go hide.

1165
01:27:51,691 --> 01:27:55,152
<i>I thought Knockout Ned
would start a revolution here.</i>

1166
01:27:55,236 --> 01:27:57,405
<i>But God had other plans.</i>

1167
01:27:58,155 --> 01:28:01,826
Steak, where are all the dealers?

1168
01:28:01,909 --> 01:28:05,037
They're hiding. Li'l Ze is in a bad mood.

1169
01:28:05,204 --> 01:28:08,958
They get us hooked
and then they go off and hide.

1170
01:28:09,041 --> 01:28:12,378
Do me a favor.
Go get some nose candy for me.

1171
01:28:12,503 --> 01:28:14,005
I'll try.

1172
01:28:14,088 --> 01:28:17,550
Tell them it's for Tiago,
to keep my buzz going.

1173
01:28:38,487 --> 01:28:40,322
Steak 'n' Fries, listen here.

1174
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:43,909
Go to Carrot's and tell him...

1175
01:28:44,243 --> 01:28:48,581
Li'l Ze says that if you kill Knockout,
he'll leave you alone.

1176
01:28:49,957 --> 01:28:52,501
Hey, Knockout Ned. Did you hear that?

1177
01:28:54,837 --> 01:28:56,464
Grab the kid!

1178
01:28:57,882 --> 01:28:59,550
You heard the boy?

1179
01:28:59,633 --> 01:29:03,512
If you don't stick with us, you're dead.

1180
01:29:03,596 --> 01:29:06,807
I think you should join us. We'll be partners.

1181
01:29:07,767 --> 01:29:10,311
Drugs aren't my thing.

1182
01:29:10,770 --> 01:29:13,689
This is just something between me and him.

1183
01:29:14,857 --> 01:29:17,860
Those guys aren't worth shit.

1184
01:29:17,985 --> 01:29:21,655
They'll do anything for power.

1185
01:29:21,822 --> 01:29:23,115
Like that kid.

1186
01:29:23,908 --> 01:29:26,494
They're all robots, like this punk here.

1187
01:29:28,329 --> 01:29:29,789
What's in your head, kid?

1188
01:29:31,373 --> 01:29:33,834
Can't you see you're wrecking your life

1189
01:29:33,918 --> 01:29:37,546
with that maniac
and a bunch of trigger-happy fools?

1190
01:29:39,632 --> 01:29:43,344
Are you crazy? You're just a kid.

1191
01:29:43,385 --> 01:29:46,013
A kid? I smoke, snort,

1192
01:29:46,347 --> 01:29:49,475
I've killed and robbed. I'm a man.

1193
01:29:49,642 --> 01:29:52,061
Shit, you have no idea!

1194
01:29:52,937 --> 01:29:56,690
He's attached to his gang.
You should join up with us.

1195
01:29:57,441 --> 01:30:00,152
Shall we kill him?
Steak, we're going to grind you.

1196
01:30:02,738 --> 01:30:04,573
Okay, I accept.

1197
01:30:04,657 --> 01:30:06,659
Great!

1198
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:11,205
Tell your boss that Knockout Ned
and Carrot are now in command.

1199
01:30:11,288 --> 01:30:12,540
But on one condition,

1200
01:30:13,749 --> 01:30:16,544
no killing of innocent people.

1201
01:30:19,046 --> 01:30:21,841
I can't accept that, understand?

1202
01:30:21,882 --> 01:30:23,551
Okay, no innocent people.

1203
01:30:27,847 --> 01:30:31,600
Steak fucked up!

1204
01:30:35,062 --> 01:30:36,730
You gonna pick a fight, fag?

1205
01:30:44,446 --> 01:30:45,781
Do you have a gun for me?

1206
01:30:45,865 --> 01:30:50,452
No, but we can hold up a gun store.

1207
01:30:50,536 --> 01:30:52,663
That's no problem.

1208
01:30:52,746 --> 01:30:54,623
I don't want to hold up anything.

1209
01:30:54,707 --> 01:30:56,834
I'm not a hoodlum.

1210
01:30:56,917 --> 01:31:00,212
This is a personal affair
between me and him, okay?

1211
01:31:00,838 --> 01:31:02,548
I'm not a hoodlum.

1212
01:31:05,551 --> 01:31:07,595
He raped your chick,

1213
01:31:07,636 --> 01:31:10,931
killed your uncle and brother,
shot up your house,

1214
01:31:11,599 --> 01:31:13,893
and you killed one of his guys.

1215
01:31:19,565 --> 01:31:22,443
If you're not a hood, then get out.

1216

<b>THE STORY OF KNOCKOUT NED</b>

1217
01:31:33,621 --> 01:31:35,122
This is a holdup!

1218
01:31:44,423 --> 01:31:45,549
<i>The first time...</i>

1219
01:31:45,966 --> 01:31:48,010
Where are the revolvers?

1220
01:31:48,093 --> 01:31:51,847
<i>Knockout Ned saved a salesclerk
from being shot by Carrot.</i>

1221
01:31:51,972 --> 01:31:56,477
We said no killing!

1222
01:31:56,518 --> 01:31:58,312
That's the rule.

1223
01:31:59,647 --> 01:32:03,984
We want the boss's money.
Everyone keep calm.

1224
01:32:04,985 --> 01:32:07,863
You want us to go? We do, too.

1225
01:32:09,740 --> 01:32:12,743
Look at the ground!

1226
01:32:12,826 --> 01:32:16,121
<i>The second time,
Carrot saved Knockout Ned's life.</i>

1227
01:32:19,416 --> 01:32:22,086
<i>Ned learned that there's an exception
to every rule.</i>

1228
01:32:22,795 --> 01:32:25,005
Exception to the rule.

1229
01:32:27,007 --> 01:32:28,509
- Are you the manager?
- Yes.

1230
01:32:28,926 --> 01:32:30,552
This is a holdup.

1231
01:32:30,636 --> 01:32:32,012
Everyone on the ground!

1232
01:32:32,429 --> 01:32:34,181
On the ground!

1233
01:32:35,849 --> 01:32:38,477
Give me the money!

1234
01:32:42,481 --> 01:32:44,525
I'm not kidding.

1235
01:32:44,692 --> 01:32:47,194
The first person who moves is dead!

1236
01:32:47,528 --> 01:32:50,781
<i>The third time,
the exception becomes the rule.</i>

1237
01:33:06,922 --> 01:33:08,507
<i>With the holdup money,</i>

1238
01:33:08,632 --> 01:33:11,552
<i>Carrot and Knockout Ned
prepared to face Li'l Ze.</i>

1239
01:33:11,593 --> 01:33:13,429
<i>Carrot could protect his business.</i>

1240
01:33:14,722 --> 01:33:16,265
<i>Knockout Ned,</i>

1241
01:33:16,348 --> 01:33:19,351
<i>the best marksman in the battalion,
wanted revenge.</i>

1242
01:33:19,727 --> 01:33:23,814
First, the Italians. This is a 9mm.

1243
01:33:24,523 --> 01:33:26,775
- Let me see.
- Not bad, eh?

1244
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:28,402
The sight isn't well-aligned.

1245
01:33:28,527 --> 01:33:30,029
I'll give you a good price.

1246
01:33:31,822 --> 01:33:35,200
The 12mm. The "hand job."

1247
01:33:35,242 --> 01:33:36,410
See Why?

1248
01:33:36,493 --> 01:33:39,580
An Uzi, 9mm. It's Israeli.

1249
01:33:39,955 --> 01:33:41,582
The Star of David.

1250
01:33:41,623 --> 01:33:42,916
Jewish.

1251
01:33:43,042 --> 01:33:44,918
I want a 30-06.

1252
01:33:45,044 --> 01:33:47,046
Now we can start having fun.

1253
01:33:50,215 --> 01:33:53,761
The war's on. Let's start with a prayer.

1254
01:33:53,927 --> 01:33:56,138
"Our Father who art in heaven,"

1255
01:33:56,263 --> 01:33:58,599
"Hallowed be thy name..."

1256
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:18,827
<i>Hoodlums have guns, but can't shoot.</i>

1257
01:34:19,244 --> 01:34:23,123
<i>One bullet from Knockout Ned
was worth 190 from Li'l Ze's gang.</i>

1258
01:34:23,457 --> 01:34:25,292
<i>Li'l Ze couldn't take it.</i>

1259
01:34:25,334 --> 01:34:27,294
<i>He counterattacked.</i>

1260
01:34:30,214 --> 01:34:34,343
<i>The slum had been a purgatory.
Now it was hell.</i>

1261
01:34:38,472 --> 01:34:40,724
<i>I decided to get out.</i>

1262
01:34:40,808 --> 01:34:43,727
<i>That's how I became a reporter.</i>

1263

<i>Like any pro,</i>

Hello, Rocket.

01:35:25,018 --> 01:35:26,520
- He's a fan of yours.
- Really?

1278
01:35:27,396 --> 01:35:29,523
You have good taste, Rocket!

1279
01:35:29,606 --> 01:35:32,276
- Well, I'm done. I'm off.

01:35:35,988 --> 01:35:39,199
<i>What should have been a quick revenge,</i>

1282
01:35:39,283 --> 01:35:41,493
<i>turned into an all-out war.</i>

1283
01:35:46,915 --> 01:35:49,376
<i>The City of God was divided.</i>

1284
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:52,796
<i>You couldn't go
from one section to the other.</i>

1285
01:35:53,297 --> 01:35:55,007
<i>Not even to visit a relative.</i>

1286
01:35:55,883 --> 01:35:59,720
<i>The cops considered anyone
living in the slum a hoodlum.</i>

1287
01:35:59,845 --> 01:36:02,389
<i>People got used to living in Vietnam.</i>

1288
01:36:07,311 --> 01:36:12,232
<i>And more and more volunteers
kept signing up to die.</i>

1289
01:36:12,316 --> 01:36:14,526
- This kid.
- What do you want?

1290
01:36:14,568 --> 01:36:16,403
A boy from Carrot's gang punched me.

1291
01:36:17,237 --> 01:36:18,947
<i>The war was an excuse for everything.</i>

1292
01:36:19,072 --> 01:36:23,744
- Li'l Ze's soldiers kicked my ass.
- Take this .22.

1293
01:36:27,206 --> 01:36:29,041
The jerk who raped my sister is with Carrot.

1294
01:36:29,082 --> 01:36:33,253
- Li'l Ze evicted my family.
- Kill. Be respected.

1295
01:36:45,933 --> 01:36:48,435
I'm Tiago, a friend of Benny's.

1296
01:36:48,519 --> 01:36:51,355
Can you read? Can you add?

1297
01:36:51,438 --> 01:36:54,399
I'm pretty good in business.

1298
01:36:55,275 --> 01:36:56,777
Okay, get to work.

1299
01:36:57,236 --> 01:37:00,697
- What do you want?
- To get my father's murderer.

1300
01:37:00,781 --> 01:37:03,742
- What's your name?
- My name's Otto.

1301
01:37:04,535 --> 01:37:06,578
Here, Otto. There you go.

1302
01:37:09,289 --> 01:37:11,416
What's the matter?

1303
01:37:11,458 --> 01:37:13,961
- He's a worker.
- But he wants a gun.

1304
01:37:14,419 --> 01:37:15,462
You want it, don't you?

1305
01:37:16,171 --> 01:37:17,756
He won't last a week.

1306
01:37:29,851 --> 01:37:32,479
<i>A year later, no one remembered</i>

1307
01:37:32,646 --> 01:37:34,273
<i>how it had all begun.</i>

1308
01:37:34,773 --> 01:37:36,483
Take that!

1309
01:37:39,111 --> 01:37:40,988
<i>For both sides, the aim was</i>

1310
01:37:41,029 --> 01:37:45,158
<i>to take over the enemy's business
in order to buy</i>

1311
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:48,412
<i>more guns and take over more businesses.</i>

1312
01:38:10,559 --> 01:38:14,187
<i>I smoke, snort, I've killed and robbed.</i>

1313
01:38:14,271 --> 01:38:15,772
<i>I'm a man.</i>

1314
01:38:37,961 --> 01:38:39,880
<i>The media started taking an interest.</i>

1315
01:38:40,255 --> 01:38:42,799
<i>The police had to intervene.</i>

1316
01:38:57,022 --> 01:38:58,982
<i>A gang leader</i>

1317
01:38:59,107 --> 01:39:01,443
<i>from the City of God was arrested today.</i>

1318
01:39:01,568 --> 01:39:03,445
<i>Manuel Machado, aka Knockout Ned,</i>

1319
01:39:03,528 --> 01:39:06,865
<i>was hospitalized after
being wounded by Li'l Ze's gang.</i>

1320
01:39:06,990 --> 01:39:09,242
<i>Our reporter interviewed him.</i>

1321
01:39:09,284 --> 01:39:10,577
<i>Is the war still going on?</i>

1322
01:39:10,661 --> 01:39:13,038
<i>It's still going on.</i>

1323
01:39:13,914 --> 01:39:15,290
<i>How many people have died?</i>

1324
01:39:16,083 --> 01:39:17,918
<i>Many have died.</i>

1325
01:39:18,543 --> 01:39:20,587
<i>Mostly innocent people.</i>

1326
01:39:22,089 --> 01:39:24,383
<i>Just knowing me is enough,</i>

1327
01:39:24,508 --> 01:39:28,345
<i>to get you killed by Li'l Ze.</i>

1328
01:39:29,304 --> 01:39:31,014
<i>The police don't go in there?</i>

1329
01:39:31,139 --> 01:39:34,976
<i>They go after me, not him.</i>

1330
01:39:35,435 --> 01:39:39,356
<i>I've been in jail,
while he goes on killing undisturbed.</i>

1331
01:39:39,481 --> 01:39:41,274
<i>And they don't arrest him.</i>

1332
01:39:41,441 --> 01:39:44,277
<i>Knockout Ned says the war will continue.</i>

1333
01:39:44,403 --> 01:39:45,862
<i>Police Chief Guedes</i>

1334
01:39:45,946 --> 01:39:49,449
<i>has promised to arrest both of the gangs.</i>

1335
01:39:58,458 --> 01:40:00,293
Motherfucker!

1336
01:40:00,335 --> 01:40:04,423
I'm the boss here,
but he gets his picture in the paper!

1337
01:40:04,464 --> 01:40:07,634
- Have you found mine?
- Just Knockout Ned's.

1338
01:40:07,801 --> 01:40:09,136
Keep looking.

1339
01:40:09,302 --> 01:40:11,972
At least my name's got to be in there.

1340
01:40:12,431 --> 01:40:14,266
- There's nothing.
- Can you read?

1341
01:40:14,307 --> 01:40:16,893
Just the pictures.

1342
01:40:17,936 --> 01:40:19,104
Nothing.

1343
01:40:20,647 --> 01:40:23,358
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

1344
01:40:23,483 --> 01:40:25,235
It's just the want ads.

1345
01:40:25,318 --> 01:40:28,363
I don't care, read everything!

1346
01:40:28,447 --> 01:40:30,198
But there aren't any articles.

1347
01:40:30,449 --> 01:40:32,701
Want a bullet in your head?

1348
01:40:35,162 --> 01:40:37,914
Got to show them who's boss here.

1349
01:40:43,462 --> 01:40:45,630
<i>- Give me the camera!
- No way!</i>

1350
01:40:49,342 --> 01:40:51,511
Take my picture, man.

1351
01:40:51,636 --> 01:40:52,804
I can't work it.

1352
01:40:53,013 --> 01:40:55,390
Go ahead.

1353
01:40:55,474 --> 01:40:57,309
I'll hold the Beretta.

1354
01:40:57,350 --> 01:40:59,269
Let me try.

1355
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:05,108
Back off.

1356
01:41:05,650 --> 01:41:06,902
There's no click.

1357
01:41:06,985 --> 01:41:09,905
What a bunch of bozos!

1358
01:41:10,572 --> 01:41:12,824
I'm fucked, damn it!

1359
01:41:15,368 --> 01:41:18,038
I have an idea.

1360
01:41:18,079 --> 01:41:21,458
I'll go get a guy I know. Hang loose.

1361
01:41:23,627 --> 01:41:25,045
Here he is.

1362
01:41:25,086 --> 01:41:27,047
Take the camera.

1363
01:41:28,298 --> 01:41:30,509
Well, kid?

1364
01:41:31,802 --> 01:41:34,012
Aren't you a photographer?

1365
01:41:34,054 --> 01:41:37,015
Make the camera work. We can't do it.

1366
01:41:39,017 --> 01:41:40,602
Take our picture.

1367
01:41:46,066 --> 01:41:49,319
- You fucking broke it.
- It wasn't me.

1368
01:41:49,444 --> 01:41:50,779
I found it.

1369
01:41:53,448 --> 01:41:55,492
It has to be wound.

1370
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:03,124
- What's your name?
- Rocket.

1371
01:42:03,208 --> 01:42:05,126
Another picture, Rocket.

1372
01:42:06,169 --> 01:42:08,463
How about two rows?

1373
01:42:08,588 --> 01:42:10,131
What?

1374
01:42:10,215 --> 01:42:12,467
Two rows. Everyone with their guns.

1375
01:42:13,468 --> 01:42:15,554
You're outside, for Christ's sake!

1376
01:42:15,637 --> 01:42:17,430
Talk to him nicely, kid.

1377
01:42:17,514 --> 01:42:19,432
Sorry. Move in please.

1378
01:42:29,734 --> 01:42:31,111
Another one.

1379
01:42:31,194 --> 01:42:33,113
I think the roll's finished.

1380
01:42:33,196 --> 01:42:35,490
- Then show us the pictures.
- They have to be developed.

1381
01:42:35,574 --> 01:42:37,617
Developed? How much is it?

1382
01:42:38,076 --> 01:42:42,289
Take this money.
And bring back the pictures.

1383
01:42:42,455 --> 01:42:45,041
I have to remove the film.

1384
01:42:45,125 --> 01:42:47,460
Keep the camera.

1385
01:42:48,295 --> 01:42:50,755
Benny wanted to give it to you, didn't he?

1386
01:42:50,797 --> 01:42:53,300
- It's yours.
- Thanks.

1387
01:42:56,595 --> 01:42:58,305
Don't forget the pictures.

1388
01:42:58,471 --> 01:43:00,765
The photos, Rocket!

1389
01:43:11,693 --> 01:43:13,612
- Pierre!
- What?

1390
01:43:14,738 --> 01:43:17,032
Can you develop this for me?

1391
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:21,995
I can't, Rocket. I could get into trouble.

1392
01:43:22,037 --> 01:43:25,206
It's only for the paper's reporters.
I could risk my job.

1393
01:43:25,290 --> 01:43:26,333
- Pierre?
- Yes, Rogerio?

1394
01:43:26,458 --> 01:43:28,251
Develop these for me.

1395
01:43:28,793 --> 01:43:30,503
This one, too, okay?

1396
01:43:32,047 --> 01:43:34,049
I'm going to lunch.

1397
01:43:35,342 --> 01:43:38,511
You're lucky. What size?

1398
01:43:38,595 --> 01:43:39,721
What?

1399
01:43:39,804 --> 01:43:41,848
For the enlargement, what size?

1400
01:43:42,682 --> 01:43:46,311
Well... Whatever you think is best.

1401
01:44:10,627 --> 01:44:11,711
- Here.
- Thanks.

1402
01:44:12,212 --> 01:44:13,630
I'm in deep shit now.

1403
01:44:17,050 --> 01:44:18,802
I'm as good as dead.

1404
01:44:30,563 --> 01:44:32,899
<i>Somebody had signed my death sentence.</i>

1405
01:44:32,983 --> 01:44:36,236
<i>I wanted to bash the jerk's face in.</i>

1406
01:44:41,866 --> 01:44:44,577
Are you Marina? You stole my photos.

1407
01:44:44,744 --> 01:44:47,539
Because of you, I'm dead.

1408
01:44:47,580 --> 01:44:50,166
What do you mean?

1409
01:44:50,917 --> 01:44:53,712
Not so loud.

1410
01:44:53,837 --> 01:44:55,797
Not so loud? I'll be killed because of you.

1411
01:44:55,922 --> 01:44:58,633
You were gone. Your photos were in the lab.

1412
01:44:58,717 --> 01:45:01,928
There's nothing I can do.
The photos in our lab

1413
01:45:02,262 --> 01:45:04,723
are photos to be published in the paper.

1414
01:45:04,764 --> 01:45:08,184
I saw the photos, I published them.

1415
01:45:08,268 --> 01:45:09,769
You stole them.

1416
01:45:10,186 --> 01:45:11,730
I did not. Here they are.

1417
01:45:11,855 --> 01:45:15,650
- Give them to me.
- Just a second.

1418
01:45:15,817 --> 01:45:18,695
- Here are your photos.
- Are there any others?

1419
01:45:18,778 --> 01:45:22,615
Calm down. What's your name?

1420
01:45:23,158 --> 01:45:25,785
- Rocket.
- Rocket?

1421
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:28,913
Nice to meet you. I'm Marina.

1422
01:45:29,706 --> 01:45:33,043
Now, relax. I have money for you.

1423
01:45:33,126 --> 01:45:34,961
For your pictures.

1424
01:45:35,503 --> 01:45:38,548
Here, when we use a picture,

1425
01:45:38,631 --> 01:45:40,759
We Pay the photographer.

1426
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,595
- Do you want to be a photographer?
- Yes.

1427
01:45:43,678 --> 01:45:45,680
Great start! On the front page.

1428
01:45:45,847 --> 01:45:48,058
How'd you get these photos?

1429
01:45:48,141 --> 01:45:49,476
I live there.

1430
01:45:49,517 --> 01:45:53,605
Rocket, no photographer
has ever been able to go in there.

1431
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:56,649
If you could bring us

1432
01:45:56,691 --> 01:45:59,861
more pictures of Li'l Ze,

1433
01:46:00,111 --> 01:46:02,447
the paper would buy them.

1434
01:46:02,489 --> 01:46:05,241
We'd pay you.

1435
01:46:05,408 --> 01:46:07,327
Could you?

1436
01:46:07,827 --> 01:46:09,496
I don't know.

1437
01:46:09,954 --> 01:46:11,581
What's the problem?

1438
01:46:11,664 --> 01:46:14,667
The problem?
I can't go there anymore at night.

1439
01:46:14,709 --> 01:46:16,419
And during the day?

1440
01:46:16,503 --> 01:46:17,712
It's too risky.

1441
01:46:20,381 --> 01:46:25,678
Look, man!
They've finally understood that I'm the boss.

1442
01:46:27,722 --> 01:46:29,682
What's your photographer friend's name?

1443
01:46:29,766 --> 01:46:31,017
Rocket.

1444
01:46:31,059 --> 01:46:34,104
He's good. I'll take more to show the others.

1445
01:46:37,148 --> 01:46:39,859
So, Rocket, is it yes or no?

1446
01:46:42,445 --> 01:46:45,532
It's a great opportunity.

1447
01:46:47,867 --> 01:46:48,868
Okay.

1448
01:46:49,369 --> 01:46:51,996
You made the right choice.

1449
01:46:52,330 --> 01:46:53,581
Very good!

1450
01:46:53,706 --> 01:46:56,292
I'll give you some film, lenses,

1451
01:46:56,376 --> 01:47:00,713
and even another camera.
I'll show you the equipment room.

1452
01:47:02,465 --> 01:47:04,592
There's another problem.

1453
01:47:04,717 --> 01:47:07,595
- What is it?
- Where can I sleep tonight?

1454
01:47:08,555 --> 01:47:10,932
I can't go back now.

1455
01:47:15,103 --> 01:47:18,439
This is a 135mm.
Will you be close up or far away?

1456
01:47:18,523 --> 01:47:19,649
Far away.

1457
01:47:19,732 --> 01:47:21,860
- Can you measure the light?
- Yes.

1458
01:47:26,322 --> 01:47:28,241
Aren't you too close?

1459
01:47:29,909 --> 01:47:31,870
<i>I don't know what spurred me</i>

1460
01:47:31,911 --> 01:47:35,957
<i>to go talk to them like that.</i>

1461
01:47:36,374 --> 01:47:39,878
<i>Maybe I was going to die,
but now I had a camera,</i>

1462
01:47:40,003 --> 01:47:42,046
<i>and a chance to become a photographer.</i>

1463
01:47:43,339 --> 01:47:45,925
Watch out for the dog shit.

1464
01:47:46,009 --> 01:47:49,721
<i>Not to mention that night I was still young.</i>

1465
01:47:49,846 --> 01:47:53,099
- Want something to eat?
- No, thank you, ma'am.

1466
01:47:53,183 --> 01:47:55,602
Nothing to eat? Nothing to drink?

1467
01:47:56,811 --> 01:47:58,104
<i>A Wm';?</i>

1468
01:47:58,438 --> 01:47:59,939
Try this.

1469
01:48:20,543 --> 01:48:22,545
It's time to go to sleep.

1470
01:48:25,715 --> 01:48:27,967
I'll show you your bed.

1471
01:48:28,218 --> 01:48:29,802
You have hot water, don't you?

1472
01:48:29,886 --> 01:48:34,390
Yes. You've never taken a hot shower?

1473
01:48:34,515 --> 01:48:36,059
- No.
- What do you do?

1474
01:48:36,392 --> 01:48:39,145
We heat up the kettle.

1475
01:48:40,104 --> 01:48:41,564
Why are you standing there?

1476
01:48:41,648 --> 01:48:43,816
What room do I sleep in?

1477
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:47,820
Unfortunately, there's only one room.

1478
01:48:47,904 --> 01:48:50,490
You have to sleep with me.

1479
01:48:50,573 --> 01:48:54,327
<i>I won't go into the details
of my first sexual experience.</i>

1480
01:48:54,410 --> 01:48:55,828
Just relax.

1481
01:48:58,039 --> 01:49:00,333
<i>Because, elsewhere,</i>

1482
01:49:00,375 --> 01:49:04,796
<i>another, more important sex scene
for the slum was taking place.</i>

1483
01:49:06,172 --> 01:49:08,383
<i>Carrot was helping Knockout Ned escape</i>

1484
01:49:08,466 --> 01:49:10,343
<i>without firing a shot.</i>

1485
01:49:12,679 --> 01:49:16,349
<i>The policeman guarding him was
in the willing hands of the nurse.</i>

1486
01:49:17,350 --> 01:49:19,060
<i>And in the meantime,</i>

1487
01:49:19,477 --> 01:49:24,065
<i>to eliminate Carrot,
Li'l Ze was investing in munitions.</i>

1488
01:49:24,232 --> 01:49:27,193
<i>He invested heavily, even if he couldn't pay.</i>

1489
01:49:28,194 --> 01:49:29,904
Remember the double-barrel?

1490
01:49:29,988 --> 01:49:33,074
- I already have it.
- This is a repeater rifle.

1491
01:49:33,533 --> 01:49:36,077
You don't have this one, the Browning.

1492
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:38,413
It'll shoot down a plane.

1493
01:49:38,496 --> 01:49:41,874
I'm not shooting down planes.
And the one I asked for?

1494
01:49:41,958 --> 01:49:43,376
The AR-15, Uncle Sam.

1495
01:49:43,668 --> 01:49:47,005
You can't get them in Brazil.

1496
01:49:47,130 --> 01:49:49,257
My ass, Uncle Sam.

1497
01:49:52,552 --> 01:49:54,262
I have a solution.

1498
01:49:54,554 --> 01:49:56,597
The Ruger. Ever seen one?

1499
01:49:56,681 --> 01:50:01,311
It's like the AR-15. Same caliber, but lighter.

1500
01:50:01,436 --> 01:50:04,731
With an infrared sight?
Four hundred shots a minute?

1501
01:50:04,772 --> 01:50:05,940
It depends.

1502
01:50:06,024 --> 01:50:07,608
It depends, my ass!

1503
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:10,236
Trying to fuck me over?

1504
01:50:10,987 --> 01:50:12,238
I'll fuck you over first.

1505
01:50:12,739 --> 01:50:15,867
You leave now,
without the money for your guns.

1506
01:50:16,743 --> 01:50:20,163
- What do I tell the boss?
- That's your problem.

1507
01:50:20,246 --> 01:50:22,123
You'll think of something.

1508
01:50:22,248 --> 01:50:24,917
You hear him, chubby? Get out.

1509
01:50:25,501 --> 01:50:27,754
Beat it, fatso.

1510
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:29,714
<i>Li'l Ze had made a big mistake.</i>

1511
01:50:29,756 --> 01:50:33,885
<i>He should have know that
behind every salesman lies a supplier.</i>

1512
01:50:34,093 --> 01:50:36,512
<i>And they don't joke around.</i>

1513
01:50:37,764 --> 01:50:39,724
Have you seen this?

1514
01:50:40,767 --> 01:50:42,560
What do they need an AR-15 for?

1515
01:50:43,311 --> 01:50:45,438
These stories will push the police
to investigate.

1516
01:50:45,521 --> 01:50:48,733
They'll nab you. And me, along with you.

1517
01:50:51,444 --> 01:50:53,446
Think I'm going to give you away?

1518
01:50:56,908 --> 01:50:59,619
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

1519
01:50:59,702 --> 01:51:01,871
But don't fuck up again.

1520
01:51:08,878 --> 01:51:10,296
Charlie!

1521
01:51:11,631 --> 01:51:12,882
Come here!

1522
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:15,134
Listen,

1523
01:51:15,301 --> 01:51:17,136
you tell him...

1524
01:51:19,055 --> 01:51:22,600
Let's go make that sleazy
little dealer pay up.

1525
01:51:35,738 --> 01:51:37,824
Come here, kids!

1526
01:51:38,825 --> 01:51:41,202
Do you like chicken?

1527
01:51:41,285 --> 01:51:42,412
It depends.

1528
01:51:42,495 --> 01:51:45,998
We'll eat some chicken
and have Carrot for dessert.

1529
01:51:46,207 --> 01:51:49,293
I have a present for you.

1530
01:51:51,796 --> 01:51:53,297
Here.

1531
01:51:55,007 --> 01:51:57,135
A big one for you.

1532
01:51:57,176 --> 01:51:59,512
Are you really giving us these guns?

1533
01:51:59,554 --> 01:52:04,392
Yes, but I want you on my side,
against Carrot.

1534
01:52:04,475 --> 01:52:06,519
Then can we hold up anyone we want?

1535
01:52:06,602 --> 01:52:09,105
Not in the slum.

1536
01:52:09,188 --> 01:52:11,065
- Can you shoot?
- More or less.

1537
01:52:11,149 --> 01:52:12,233
More or less?

1538
01:52:12,316 --> 01:52:15,695
Hey, you guys, come help these kids.

1539
01:52:15,778 --> 01:52:17,780
I know. You do it like this.

1540
01:52:27,596 --> 01:52:29,734
<b>THE BEGINNING OF THE END</b>

1541
01:52:39,010 --> 01:52:40,678
Get that chicken!

1542
01:52:54,233 --> 01:52:56,110
If Li'l Ze catches you, he'll kill you.

1543
01:52:58,070 --> 01:53:00,490
Yeah, well, he's got to find me first.

1544
01:53:09,290 --> 01:53:11,042
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!

1545
01:53:14,754 --> 01:53:16,923
Shit! The cops!

1546
01:53:16,964 --> 01:53:18,591
Hell, don't fucking run off!

1547
01:53:18,925 --> 01:53:20,551
Give me that.

1548
01:53:31,896 --> 01:53:34,273
Hey, Melonhead! You fucking fag!

1549
01:53:34,315 --> 01:53:37,568
Get the hell out of here!

1550
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:38,694
Coward!

1551
01:53:38,778 --> 01:53:39,987
Asshole!

1552
01:53:42,448 --> 01:53:45,409
Come on, let them kill each other.

1553
01:53:45,451 --> 01:53:47,203
They can fuck themselves.

1554
01:53:56,295 --> 01:53:58,839
Rocket! Take a picture of us!

1555
01:54:00,216 --> 01:54:02,593
What are you waiting for?

1556
01:54:23,739 --> 01:54:25,950
What's happening?

1557
01:54:25,992 --> 01:54:27,034
Shit!

1558
01:54:29,370 --> 01:54:30,413
Let's go!

1559
01:54:31,247 --> 01:54:32,665
Run! Run!

1560
01:54:36,460 --> 01:54:38,796
Watch out!

1561
01:54:40,673 --> 01:54:43,509
Kill one of these faggots! Blast him!

1562
01:55:14,707 --> 01:55:15,708
Let's go!

1563
01:55:15,958 --> 01:55:17,209
Get out, bro!

1564
01:55:17,335 --> 01:55:19,045
C'mon, Ze. C'mon, son of a bitch.

1565
01:55:20,546 --> 01:55:23,716
Shoot that faggot, asshole.
Blow them away!

1566
01:55:43,235 --> 01:55:44,445
Shit!

1567
01:55:57,124 --> 01:55:58,709
Knockout Ned!

1568
01:55:59,251 --> 01:56:01,754
Take it easy. Don't move.

1569
01:56:01,796 --> 01:56:02,880
It hurts, man.

1570
01:56:04,340 --> 01:56:06,509
Easy does it, kid.

1571
01:56:07,885 --> 01:56:10,596
Why did you join this fucking war?

1572
01:56:10,721 --> 01:56:11,931
Knockout Ned!

1573
01:56:11,972 --> 01:56:15,059
Li'l Ze's been hit. Come on!

1574
01:56:15,101 --> 01:56:16,310
Wait here. I'll help you.

1575
01:56:16,394 --> 01:56:17,937
Just hold on.

1576
01:56:27,279 --> 01:56:30,241
<i>- What's your name?
- My name's Otto.</i>

1577
01:56:38,499 --> 01:56:40,960
I want to get my father's murderer.

1578
01:57:06,485 --> 01:57:09,029
<i>Knockout Ned! Li'l Ze's been hit. Come on!</i>

1579
01:57:09,655 --> 01:57:10,740
I'll help you.

1580
01:57:10,906 --> 01:57:12,533
Just hold on there.

1581
01:57:53,449 --> 01:57:55,451
The fucking cops!

1582
01:57:58,788 --> 01:58:00,539
On the ground!

1583
01:58:01,624 --> 01:58:04,293
- Don't move!
- Hands over your head.

1584
01:58:08,214 --> 01:58:11,383
- You're the one I want.
- You're finished, pal.

1585
01:58:12,051 --> 01:58:14,720
Handcuff him.

1586
01:58:34,573 --> 01:58:36,075
Rocket, where are you going?

1587
01:58:36,158 --> 01:58:38,452
I got something to clear up.

1588
01:59:10,150 --> 01:59:11,610
Okay, lovebirds.

1589
01:59:11,694 --> 01:59:14,238
Come on, Li'l Ze. Let's go settle our scores.

1590
01:59:16,115 --> 01:59:19,243
Not you. You're a present for the media.

1591
01:59:56,238 --> 01:59:58,032
Does it come to 10,000?

1592
01:59:58,115 --> 02:00:00,910
Almost. That's all I have.

1593
02:00:01,327 --> 02:00:02,828
That's all there was, Chief.

1594
02:00:02,995 --> 02:00:05,205
We searched everywhere.

1595
02:00:09,835 --> 02:00:11,211
Let him go.

1596
02:00:11,629 --> 02:00:14,840
What about this ring? ls it gold?

1597
02:00:16,342 --> 02:00:19,345
Fill it up. You'll owe us the rest.

1598
02:00:24,642 --> 02:00:26,852
Fucking war!

1599
02:00:29,188 --> 02:00:31,690
Knockout Ned is dead and I'm dead broke.

1600
02:00:31,774 --> 02:00:34,193
You're fucked, eh?

1601
02:00:34,234 --> 02:00:35,611
Kids,

1602
02:00:35,694 --> 02:00:39,698
we'll have to do a few holdups
to get my business going again.

1603
02:00:39,782 --> 02:00:41,408
Your business, Li'l Ze?

1604
02:00:41,492 --> 02:00:43,035
What's your problem, kid?

1605
02:00:43,202 --> 02:00:45,454
This is for our friend, motherfucker!

1606
02:00:45,871 --> 02:00:47,373
A Soviet attack.

1607
02:00:54,588 --> 02:00:57,216
The business is ours!

1608
02:01:51,603 --> 02:01:53,897
<i>The picture of the hood</i>

1609
02:01:54,273 --> 02:01:55,774
<i>will get me the job.</i>

1610
02:01:58,110 --> 02:01:59,945
<i>This one will make me famous.</i>

1611
02:02:00,029 --> 02:02:02,656
<i>It'll even make the cover of a magazine</i>

1612
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:06,994
<i>I won't have to worry about Li'l Ze anymore.</i>

1613
02:02:10,748 --> 02:02:12,374
<i>But the cops?</i>

1614
02:02:20,799 --> 02:02:27,473
Gangster, Self-styled 'Boss'
of the City of God, Shot Dead

1615
02:02:27,556 --> 02:02:32,394
This photo could've gotten us killed?

1616
02:02:32,478 --> 02:02:33,854
I think so.

1617
02:02:33,979 --> 02:02:35,981
At least it got you a job.

1618
02:02:36,940 --> 02:02:38,692
Not a job, an internship.

1619
02:02:38,776 --> 02:02:40,903
It pays a little, doesn't it?

1620
02:02:40,986 --> 02:02:42,863
A little.

1621
02:02:43,864 --> 02:02:46,909
What about that lady journalist?
Was she a good lay?

1622
02:02:46,992 --> 02:02:48,160
More or less.

1623
02:02:48,243 --> 02:02:49,620
You didn't like it?

1624
02:02:49,661 --> 02:02:52,039
I don't think journalists know how to screw.

1625
02:02:52,122 --> 02:02:53,248
Yeah, I guess so.

1626
02:02:53,332 --> 02:02:55,292
Cocoa robbed three houses in Barra.

1627
02:02:55,334 --> 02:02:57,336
Better kill him.

1628
02:02:57,836 --> 02:02:59,630
Who shot Roger?

1629
02:02:59,671 --> 02:03:02,216
- It was Beef.
- Kill that fucker.

1630
02:03:02,299 --> 02:03:04,551
We should kill the Chief and Gringo as well.

1631
02:03:04,635 --> 02:03:05,761
What about Cherry?

1632
02:03:05,844 --> 02:03:08,347
Let's go. Us two, and three others.

1633
02:03:08,430 --> 02:03:10,307
It's a deal.

1634
02:03:10,557 --> 02:03:13,435
Have you heard of the Red Brigade?

1635
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:16,021
No, but if they come, we'll kill them.

1636
02:03:18,232 --> 02:03:20,192
- Who knows how to write?
- Me, sort of.

1637
02:03:20,234 --> 02:03:24,363
Let's make a blacklist. We'll kill them all.

1638
02:03:24,696 --> 02:03:26,907
Put fucking Night Owl on there.

1639
02:03:27,199 --> 02:03:28,200
And Croquet.

1640
02:03:28,283 --> 02:03:30,494
Leonard, too. He owes me money.

1641
02:03:30,744 --> 02:03:32,371
And China-Man. He thinks he's hot stuff.

1642
02:03:32,538 --> 02:03:33,914
And Claudio.

1643
02:03:33,997 --> 02:03:35,457
Where's Giant?

1644
02:03:35,541 --> 02:03:36,708
Come here, Giant!

1645
02:03:52,599 --> 02:03:54,393
<i>I forgot to say,</i>
