CITY OF GOD

2
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:11,630
Fuck, the chicken's got away!
Go after that chicken, man!

3
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,304
Get that chicken!

4
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,394
(Gunshot)

5
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:14,775

(Horn)

7
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:26,738
If Li’s Z catches you,
he'll kill you.

8
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,583
Yeah, well, he's gotta find me first.

9
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,544
Get that chicken!

10
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:42,883
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!

11
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,847
Get that chicken!

12
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,929
Shit! The cops!

13
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,348
Hell, don't fucking run off!

14
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,267
Give me that.

15
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:56,609
Hey, Melon head!
You fucking fag!

16
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,897
<i>A picture could change my life,</i>

17
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,367
<i>but in the City of God,
if you run away, they get you,</i>

18
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,028
<i>and if you stay, they get you too.</i>

19
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,699
<i>It's been that way
ever since I was a kid.</i>

20
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,211
(Cheering)

21
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,430
You're useless, man!

22
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,721
- Go get the ball!
- Fucking useless!

23
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:36,858
Hey, kid!
Give me the ball. I wanna play.

24
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,237
You wanna mess with me?

25
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,154
Fuck off.
What's your name?

26
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,369
<i>Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself.</i>

27
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,456
- I'm Rocket.
- Some advice, Rocket...

28
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,702
Don't let Li’s Dice touch that ball.
He sucks.

29
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,212
You lose, pal.

30
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,798
<i>That's shaggy-.</i>

31
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,920
<i>To tell the story of the City of God,
I have to start with him.</i>

32
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,513
...eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve...

33
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,598
<i>But in order to tell Shaggy story,</i>

34
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,218
<i>I must tell the story
of the Tender Trio.</i>

35
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,846
Well, Shaggy?
The gas truck's coming.

36
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:19,226
- What are you fucking around for?
- You're not gonna chicken out.

37
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,999
<i>The notorious Tender Trio
was legendary in the City of God.</i>

38
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,617
<i>Shaggy'.</i>

39
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,827
<i>Clipper</i>

40
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,246
<i>and Goose.</i>

41
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:48,096
<i>Tagging along were always Li'! Dice
and Benny, Shaggy brother.</i>

42
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,013
<i>I never had the courage
to follow my brother.</i>

43
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,610
OK, let's go.

44
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,611
- Come on, Goose.
- Let's go!

45
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,200
(Bell)

46
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,830
(Horn)

47
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,712
Stop this fucker!

48
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,336
Stop or I'll shoot, motherfucker!

49
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,138
Get out!

50
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:37,387
Hurry up, asshole!
Gimme the money!

51
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,264
Who wants gas?

52
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:52,368
More! You wanna die
for your boss's damn money?

53
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,533
Shitloads of money here!

54
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,991
You see, asshole?

55
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,168
(Siren)

56
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,333
Fuck! The cops!

57
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,805
(Tyres screech)

58
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,642
Clear out! Everything is fucked up.

59
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:48,207
<i>Back then, I thought
the guys in the Tender Trio</i>

60
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:51,426
<i>were the most dangerous hoods
in Rio.</i>

61
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:54,297
Here! Buy some new balls.

62
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,968
<i>But they were just amateurs.</i>

63
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,764
<i>Even my brother, Goose.</i>

64
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,982
Give this money to Dad.

65
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,735
But don't tell him it's from me.
OK?

66
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,067
- Hey, Stringy!
- Yeah?

67
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,161
- Let's go.
- Look how much I've got.

68
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:38,807
<i>We came to the City of God
hoping to find paradise.</i>

69
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:42,053
<i>Many families were homeless</i>

70
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:46,353
<i>due to flooding
and acts of arson in the slums.</i>

71
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:49,398
A street light!
We'll have electricity!

72
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,770
<i>The bigwigs in government
didn't joke around.</i>

73
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:55,116
<i>Homeless? Off to City of God!</i>

74
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:59,237
<i>There was no electricity,
paved streets or transportation.</i>

75
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:03,286
<i>But for the powerful,
our problems didn't matter.</i>

76
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,001
<i>We were too far removed</i>

77
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,962
<i>from the picture postcard image
of Rio de Janeiro.</i>

78
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,057
Do you think I can become
a lifeguard one day?

79
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,104
I don't know.

80
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:33,150
Being a lifeguard
is better than a fishmonger.

81
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,773
I don't want to sell fish. It stinks.

82
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,651
- Are you insulting your father?
- No.

83
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,367
So what do you want to be?

84
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,410
I don't know.

85
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:48,207
- Not a hood or a policeman.
- Why not?

86
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,828
I'm scared of getting shot.

87
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,761
Put that thing away, kid.

88
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:01,382
Are you nuts?
Pointing that gun at me?

89
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,886
Take it easy with the kid, Goose.
Li's Dice is with me.

90
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,059
Right, I'm a gangster too.

91
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,023
That gas truck didn't bring much.

92
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,189
So what?
We rob gas trucks every day.

93
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,357
One today, another tomorrow.

94
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,947
No, we need to rob
some rich guy's house.

95
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,658
That's the only way to get outta here.

96
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:23,199
Hell, no. What you need
is to follow my plan.

97
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,696
That's it.

98
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,417
The little fart's getting
too big for his britches!

99
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,748
(Laughter over dialogue)

100
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:38,879
He gets high
and starts talking bullshit.

101
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:43,257
You two junkies aren't worth
half as much as that kid.

102
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,561
What you got in mind, Li’s Dice?

103
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:53,309
<i>To be a real hood you need more
than just a gun. You need ideas.</i>

104
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,564
<i>And Li'! Dice had them.</i>

105
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,701
- Is that the motel?
- Yeah.

106
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:07,414
We grab the money and get out.
No killing.

107
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,955
- I need this.
- Don't touch my gun.

108
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,920
- Don't do that again.
- Don't point at me.

109
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,539
Don't point your finger at me!

110
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,042
Stop acting like a baby!

111
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,127
Here's yours.

112
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,675
Awesome!
Let's go!

113
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,390
- Not so fast!
- What?

114
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,182
You stay here and keep watch.

115
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:34,024
If the cops come,
shoot that window over there.

116
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,644
- Why me? Let that dork do that.
- Calm down.

117
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:41,900
I gave you this great plan for free
while that guy's absolutely useless!

118
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,867
- You just had the idea.
- Exactly!

119
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,532
You're just a kid, remember?

120
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,702
You cover us, OK?

121
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,953
Let's go.

122
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:55,876
You'll get your turn.
Stop trying to rush things.

123
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,839
You stay there.

124
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,253
EXIT

125
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,222
This is a hold-up, bitch.

126
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,103
You should be studying or working.

127
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:16,226
You don't look like hoodlums.
You can't even tell.

128
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,604
You should be working, studying.

129
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,481
Shut up! What a pain in the ass!

130
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,325
OK, Clipper?

131
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,653
Shall we go in?

132
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,331
I didn't order anything.

133
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:40,633
It's on the house, sir.
Hand over the money!

134
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,047
Keep calm. All I want is your cash.

135
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,886
- Don't point that...
- Your wallet...

136
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,900
Hey, man.

137
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,236
What kind of whorehouse is this?

138
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,488
(Screams)

139
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,947
- You from the church?
- Yes, brother.

140
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,113
Give it to me!

141
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,700
Slut!

142
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,668
You're fat and flabby!

143
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,913
Wanna take her place?

144
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,590
(Gunshots)

145
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,549
What's going on?

146
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,890
- The cops!
- Let's beat it!

147
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:37,231
Take that car.
I'll go get Li’s Dice.

148
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,690
Jesus, what a car!

149
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,073
Something fucked up.
Li’s Dice is gone.

150
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,698
The cops are shooting. Let's go!

151
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,439
Slow down! Hold on.
You said you knew how to drive.

152
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,063
I do, so cool it!

153
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,940
Turn! Watch out!

154
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,154
(Tyres screech)

155
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,655
(Horn blares)

156
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,339
You fucking asshole!

157
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:48,256
Hey, I didn't do it on purpose.

158
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,878
No-one saw anything.

159
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,803
So keep your mouths shut,
understand?

160
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:55,759
(Gunshot)

161
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,353
Hold on, I twisted my ankle.

162
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,222
Goose fucked up his ankle.

163
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,440
- What happened?
- It fucking hurts.

164
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:06,483
Take him into the woods.
I'll shoot to distract the cops.

165
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,356
- In God we trust.
- In God we trust.

166
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,117
<i>Pass</i> me the telephone, Penguin.

167
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:20,334
<i>Shorty is another notorious guy
in the City of God.</i>

168
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:23,045
<i>But it's not yet time
to tell his story.</i>

169
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:27,333
It fucking hurts, Goose.

170
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,210
Shut up.

171
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:34,090
You sound like a damn sissy, man.

172
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,640
Climb up!

173
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,262
No-one saw anything?

174
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:46,394
How odd! A car crashes into a bar
and no-one saw a thing.

175
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,612
I suppose
you didn't see anything either?

176
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:54,986
As usual, no-one saw,
no-one knows.

177
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,326
So what's up, Shorty?

178
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,576
They're hiding in the woods.

179
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,793
Hello, Melon head.

180
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:07,665
I have this feeling
that they're out in the woods.

181
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,135
- The motherfuckers.
- They're out in the woods.

182
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:15,756
Felipe, lock up the car.
Angel, come with me.

183
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:23,017
I can't see a thing.
How the hell can they see?

184
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,436
Fucking jungle.

185
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,397
(Panting)

186
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,735
- They stole a fortune at that motel.
- I know.

187
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,361
What if we took the money?

188
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,494
Are you crazy?

189
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,583
I'm not getting mixed up in that.

190
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,702
I want to exterminate these guys.

191
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:50,753
What? Since when is stealing
from niggers and thieves a crime?

192
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,967
It won't be hard to nab them.

193
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:57,090
I have a stool in the City.

194
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,557
(Flies buzzing)

195
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,530
(Gunshots)

196
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:26,535
Did you hear those shots?

197
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,208
If I catch one of them, I'll kill him.

198
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,588
(Cock crows)

199
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,550
Maraca!

200
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,099
Open the door!

201
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:51,561
- What's the matter?
- The cops are after me.

202
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,826
Shaggy!

203
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:07,038
The cops are on my ass!
Hide me!

204
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,411
Quick, come in.

205
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,635
Shit.

206
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,506
I thought the cops
would be down there all night.

207
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,180
I had a vision, Goose.

208
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,979
You been smoking something?

209
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,521
- You've had a job, right?
- Yeah.

210
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,815
What's it like?
What do people say?

211
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:40,113
I worked with my father.
And fathers talk a lot of shit.

212
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,702
You know what, Goose?

213
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,162
I'm getting out.
I don't want to die.

214
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,783
This gangster's life isn't for me.

215
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,752
Wait!
The cops are still down there.

216
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,212
I don't give a shit.

217
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,760
I'm going back to the church.

218
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:03,473
<i>I will say of the Lord,</i>

219
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:09,813
<i>he is my refuge and my fortress,
in him will I trust.</i>

220
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,854
<i>Fear not the terror by night,</i>

221
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,819
<i>nor the arrow that flies by day.</i>

222
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:18,859
- Stop, motherfucker!
- Don't move!

223
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,403
Stop, or I'll shoot!

224
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,535
(Gunshots)

225
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:31,410
<i>...shall abide under the shadow
of the Almighty.</i>

226
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:36,336
<i>The hold-up at the motel went down
as the bloodiest in history.</i>

227
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,380
<i>The destinies of the outlaws
then took different paths.</i>

228
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:43,050
I don't think this guy
was involved in the heist.

229
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,014
See here?

230
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:49,307
- He's a worker, not a hoodlum.
- I'll make him one now.

231
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,721
(Bullet ricochets)

232
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:58,020
<i>Destiny put Clipper
back into the hands of God.</i>

233
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:03,992
<i>Shaggy was in Bernice's hands.</i>

234
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:08,079
<i>And Goose was in my father's hands.</i>

235
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,576
Why do you do these things?
You think I'm a fool?

236
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,704
From now on, you'll work with me.

237
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,050
Your younger brother
will keep an eye on you.

238
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:25,264
If I catch you
with money that isn't yours,

239
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,098
I'll kill you.

240
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,637
That goes for you, too.

241
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,932
Get changed!
You start work immediately.

242
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:36,483
<i>Having a hood as a brother sucks.</i>

243
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,898
<i>You always end up footing the bill.</i>

244
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,691
Don't worry.

245
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:46,819
Dad's mad at me,
but he'll get over it.

246
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:53,910
Give me that, Rocket.
It's not for you.

247
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:56,537
- You have to study.
- Getting shot doesn't scare you?

248
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,504
I'm a hood because I got no brain.

249
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:03,093
But you're smart.
You should study.

250
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:06,839
I go to school
because I don't like physical work.

251
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,305
Promise me something...

252
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:12,223
That you'll never touch this gun.
Promise?

253
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:13,845
Let's shake.

254
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,566
We'd better hurry.

255
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:23,105
I'm gonna sell a lot of fish.
And don't laugh.

256
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:25,152
You grinned when I got slapped.

257
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,241
- Who, me?
- I saw you.

258
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,852
What is it, Shaggy?
Cat got your tongue?

259
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:01,477
Your fidgeting behind me
makes me nervous.

260
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,819
I'm thinking of what to say to you.

261
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:08,363
You're thinking, as well?
Don't. It'll be your downfall.

262
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:13,079
My heart has chosen you.
And I follow my heart.

263
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,619
Are you pulling my leg?

264
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:19,335
You never heard
of love at first sight?

265
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,205
Hoods don't love,
they desire.

266
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,548
You criticism everything I say.

267
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:28,636
Hoods don't talk,
they smooth-talk.

268
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:32,132
Well, I'll stop
wasting my breath on you.

269
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:36,728
Hoods don't stop,
they take a break.

270
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:39,314
Talking about love with you
sure is complicated.

271
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:43,185
It's not love, it's a con game.

272
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,453
It's just that I love you.

273
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,673
You just might end up convincing me.

274
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:30,027
<i>After the hold-up,</i>

275
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,697
<i>there were constant police raids
in the slum.</i>

276
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,327
(Shouting)

277
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:44,793
<i>Every day, someone got beaten up,
someone was nailed.</i>

278
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:48,796
<i>But no-one had seen anything.</i>

279
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,714
<i>No-one knew anything.</i>

280
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,847
<i>No-one blabbed to the cops</i>

281
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:57,889
<i>about where the thieves
were hiding out.</i>

282
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:03,306
<i>Shavian -</i>

283
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,980
Why don't you change your life?

284
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:10,981
Get a job instead of
lying around in bed all day.

285
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:14,109
- Good-for-nothing!
- What do you mean?

286
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:17,738
You think you can make money
working? Go ahead.

287
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:21,707
That's right, Shaggy.
What do you think I do all day?

288
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,004
Take it easy, baby.

289
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:31,468
You know all I want is to be with you,
have kids

290
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:36,089
and a farm, raise chickens,
grow pot and get high.

291
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:40,560
Sure! For me,
that's nothing but smooth talk.

292
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:54,358
What? I almost got rich
with that motel job.

293
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,983
Are you kidding?

294
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,535
The cops are still looking for you
because of the deaths in the motel.

295
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:04,868
What deaths?
What are you talking about?

296
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:08,497
Did you see anything?
You don't know shit, so shut up.

297
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,715
You weren't there.
I didn't kill anyone.

298
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:15,587
I bet it's those fucking policemen,
and I'm the one taking the rap.

299
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:19,307
They even nabbed Li’s Dice.
So don't bring it up again!

300
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,811
- I don't care who did it.
- It wasn't me.

301
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,521
Let me just say.

302
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:29,313
I don't want my kid's father
to be a hoodlum. You're all alone.

303
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,027
- All alone?
- That's right!

304
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:33,738
- Clipper's gone religious.
- Hallelujah!

305
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,527
- Goose is working.
- Ass-kisser!

306
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,117
- And you?
- I haven't changed. So what?

307
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:42,455
They've deserted me, that's all.

308
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,995
Then I'm deserting you too.

309
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:47,789
I'm splitting, Shaggy.
Come with me, if you want.

310
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:51,085
Otherwise I'll go alone.

311
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:07,397
Fish for sale!

312
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,855
<i>My brother had promised
to stop messing around.</i>

313
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,979
<i>But a hood doesn't stop.</i>

314
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:17,698
<i>A hood takes a break.</i>

315
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:21,661
<i>Goose began messing around
with Shorty's wife.</i>

316
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:26,704
I have trout.
But for special customers like you,

317
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:29,874
I also have a kisser fish.

318
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,417
Hey, that's a mullet!

319
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:39,255
Doesn't your husband
go down on you?

320
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:42,048
No.

321
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:45,472
Mine, before entering me,
has to use his tongue.

322
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,436
For about half an hour.

323
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:50,182
And from behind?
Do you let him?

324
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:53,776
Good God, no.
Doesn't it hurt?

325
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,895
The first few times.

326
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:59,820
Then you'll see, it's fantastic.
But you need a banana.

327
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,283
What for?

328
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:04,905
You're missing
the good things in life, girl!

329
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,873
You take a banana, warm it up...

330
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:11,336
Put it up your thing,
while he takes you from behind.

331
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,000
It's a real rush!

332
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,044
Ask your husband.

333
00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:19,715
I couldn't. You don't know him.

334
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,758
He's liable to beat me.

335
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:26,180
Try him.
Men go wild for smut like that.

336
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:33,895
Motherfucking nigger!

337
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,319
(Screaming)

338
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:39,439
Slut!

339
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,775
Whoring bitch!

340
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:49,999
Rocket, give me your shorts.

341
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:52,585
Take them off, damn it!

342
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:56,547
- No way I'm getting naked!
- You want your brother to die?

343
00:27:56,675 --> 00:28:00,669
- Give me your shorts!
- Give me your shirt.

344
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,011
(Sirens wailing)

345
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,177
Your shorts! Hurry up!

346
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:12,351
I knew it. It's always me
who forks out for that bum.

347
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,407
The bastard ran off.
That's his brother.

348
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,947
- That brat there?
- I'll castrate that fucker.

349
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:32,994
Fish! Fish for sale!

350
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:36,500
Hey, kid, come over here.

351
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,924
- Where's your brother?
- He's not working today.

352
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,715
- Get in.
- I didn't do anything.

353
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,054
- Get in!
- What about my fish?

354
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,344
Hurry it up, kid!

355
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:51,970
- I don't want to lose my fish!
- Forget your fish. Give me that.

356
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:53,471
Get in.

357
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:57,396
- My father will kill me.
- That doesn't matter.

358
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:10,993
Let's go. There's nothing here.

359
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:15,210
<i>That day, my father swore he never
wanted to see my brother again.</i>

360
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,169
Let's go, Felipe.

361
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:21,457
<i>And he never did.</i>

362
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,550
<i>No-one ever saw him
in the slum again.</i>

363
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,890
<i>The story of the Tender Trio
was coming to an end.</i>

364
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:30,850
Li’s Dice?

365
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:34,391
Shit, man. I thought
you were a goner at the motel.

366
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,311
You're fucking loaded!

367
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:41,653
Don't, Benny. That's our money.

368
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,489
Fuck you.
Cut the crap and give me the money.

369
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,607
Benny.

370
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:50,578
Tell your brother Shaggy
that Shorty is squealing.

371
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,663
I'm leaving the slum.

372
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,499
<i>But Shorty had his hands full.</i>

373
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,834
(weeping)

374
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,965
Let's go see, Stringy.

375
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:13,684
(Crowd murmuring)

376
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:24,692
<i>A neighbour called the police
before sunrise.</i>

377
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,861
<i>The tabloids went to town.</i>

378
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:31,486
<i>"Man Buries Wife Alive
in the City of God."</i>

379
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:35,081
<i>Along with reporters,
the place was swarming with cops.</i>

380
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,288
<i>The hoodlums took off.</i>

381
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,161
You wanna die?

382
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:44,791
It's you who's gonna die
if you don't do what I say.

383
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:47,089
And show the lady more respect.

384
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,046
Let's go, damn it!

385
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:54,266
- There are cops ahead.
- Fuck them, let's go.

386
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:58,184
- Where to?
- Anywhere, just go.

387
00:30:58,315 --> 00:30:59,476
(Engine splutters)

388
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,019
What's the matter?

389
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:04,189
Have mercy!
This car is a piece of junk.

390
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:09,407
- My ass! Start the damn thing!
- It needs a push.

391
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,867
Push,Shay!

392
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,326
Push!

393
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:30,382
You? I don't understand.

394
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:34,469
You want to arrest the thieves?
Over there.

395
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,093
Nab that guy over there!

396
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,453
Run, shaggy!

397
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,833
Stop the car!

398
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:52,251
This way! He's over here.

399
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:57,556
We got that son of a bitch!

400
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:13,485
- The bastard!
- He's a murderer.

401
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:18,202
<i>On the day Shaggy died,
I remember the crowds</i>

402
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,288
<i>and a camera.</i>

403
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,158
<i>I'd always wanted to have one.</i>

404
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:28,379
Let's go to school.

405
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:39,723
- Well?
- Let's go to the beach.

406
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,718
- But we have an exam.
- So what?

407
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:48,144
Everyone else is at the beach.

408
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:50,985
Come on, let's go!

409
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:54,902
She's in a bikini,
but doesn't want to go.

410
00:33:55,033 --> 00:34:00,119
What's that saying you have?

411
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:03,239
The sun is for everyone,
the beach for those who deserve it.

412
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,626
<i>I bought my first camera
when I was 16.</i>

413
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,716
<i>Like all poor people,
I started at the bottom</i>

414
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:17,587
<i>with the world's cheapest model.</i>

415
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:21,678
So, Rocket? How are things going?

416
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:25,929
- Any luck getting laid yet?
- None.

417
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:30,308
<i>Angelica, I was crazy about her.</i>

418
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:33,061
So, Rocket, still clicking away?

419
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:37,155
<i>She was gorgeous and the only girl
in our gang who screwed.</i>

420
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:39,366
<i>I wanted to lose my virginity with her.</i>

421
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,235
With her, buddy?

422
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,112
She's got a guy.

423
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:46,081
- So? I'm not jealous.
- Her dad's a sergeant.

424
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:48,242
No-one's perfect.

425
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,585
Closer together!

426
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:54,173
<i>I was the official photographer
of our gang.</i>

427
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:55,791
<i>The gang of grooves.</i>

428
00:34:55,927 --> 00:35:00,171
<i>Everyone paid
to have copies of the pictures.</i>

429
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:09,639
Ti ago, move back a little.

430
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:10,936
Is this OK?

431
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:12,650
Perfect.

432
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,232
(Laughter and cheering)

433
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,613
I need a joint.

434
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:27,616
Instead of smoking, man,
you should snort coke. It's far out.

435
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:31,710
You snort, Ti ago?
I prefer a good toke.

436
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:37,375
If you like, I can get it for you.

437
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:42,051
You can?
Then go on, move your ass!

438
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:46,176
But the choice stuff is coke.
That's a real necrotic.

439
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,143
Narcotic!

440
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:54,901
- Your mouth is all salty, Ti ago.
- Screw you.

441
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:57,770
You want to be a lifeguard, Stringy?

442
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,364
- You're never in the water.
- What?

443
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:04,360
- I'll bet you a beer I swim better.
- You're on.

444
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:11,125
If you like,
I can go get you a joint at Black’s.

445
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:27,262
<i>I'd have done anything to please her.</i>

446
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:30,144
<i>Buy her pot, coke.</i>

447
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:40,863
<i>I could g to the top dogs
to buy quality stuff' at' a good price</i>

448
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:48,200
<i>because the local boss
was a former classmate, Black.</i>

449
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,535
Who is it?

450
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,658
Rocket.

451
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,419
Come in.

452
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,630
- How are things down there?
- Fine.

453
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:01,171
- And the kids?
- Fine too.

454
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:03,294
- You want to buy or smoke a joint?
- Buy.

455
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,262
Come in, buddy.

456
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,637
(Knocking)

457
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,260
Who is it?

458
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:21,236
<i>This was Black's turf.</i>

459
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,857
<i>But it hadn't always been his.</i>

460
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,745
- Hey, Black.
- Fuck, Li’s Dice.

461
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,830
You show up like this at my place?

462
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,120
Who said it was your place?

463
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:41,500
<i>Dona Zelig began selling drugs here</i>

464
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:45,720
<i>in order to raise her daughters.</i>

465
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,384
<i>She also gave away drugs
to boys at times</i>

466
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:51,509
<i>in return for special favors.</i>

467
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:54,057
<i>Her favourite was "Big Boy".</i>

468
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:57,227
<i>One day, he grew very big!</i>

469
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,691
<i>Shelia’s operation was so amateur</i>

470
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,279
<i>that he had no trouble
seizing it from her.</i>

471
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:08,276
<i>Big Boy used
the neighbourhood kids as dealers.</i>

472
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:12,826
- What about my pot?
- Stick it up your ass.

473
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,700
<i>The best dealer...</i>

474
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:17,326
I sold everything.

475
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:20,124
<i>...was a guy called Carrot.</i>

476
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:23,045
Can I have a sip?

477
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,964
<i>He earned Big Boy's trust</i>

478
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:29,088
<i>and moved up to become a manager.</i>

479
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:32,216
Black, 20 for us and 5 for you, OK?

480
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:37,437
<i>One day
a buddy of Carrot's showed up.</i>

481
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:41,400
<i>His name was Aristotle.</i>

482
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:43,439
My wife needs an operation.

483
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:47,907
<i>His family had taken Carrot in</i>

484
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,116
<i>when he was down and out.</i>

485
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,953
<i>He couldn't refuse
to help a brother in need.</i>

486
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:57,791
Here's the dope. I want the dough
no later than Friday.

487
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:01,162
- You've bailed me out, brother.
- Friday.

488
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:05,132
He's my buddy.
Practically my brother, Big Boy.

489
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:09,094
Give him another week.

490
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:14,133
Either you kill him or I'll kill you.

491
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:15,759
<i>Carrot had no choice.</i>

492
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:18,763
- Hear the news? I got a job.
- I said Friday.

493
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:21,311
Don't do it, man.

494
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:26,438
<i>Carrot wanted to kill Big Boy,
but it wasn't necessary.</i>

495
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:30,362
<i>Big Boy hadn't paid off the cops.
He died in jail.</i>

496
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,325
We got them!

497
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,368
<i>Carrot took everything
that belonged to Big Boy,</i>

498
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,788
<i>but didn't want the apartment.</i>

499
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:42,411
<i>The place was ill-fated.</i>

500
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:45,039
<i>Carrot gave it
to his most trusted dealer...</i>

501
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:46,165
<i>150 bags.</i>

502
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:47,462
<i>...Black.</i>

503
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:50,461
We can sell loads.

504
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:54,010
<i>That's how he took over
the local trade.</i>

505
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,133
<i>But not for long.</i>

506
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:57,430
(Knocking)

507
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,394
Who is it?

508
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,897
Go see.

509
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,993
- Hey, Black.
- Fuck, Li’s Dice.

510
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,953
You show up like this at my place?

511
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:19,494
Who said it was your place?

512
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,993
Yeah, who?

513
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,214
Li’s Dice?

514
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:31,631
Li’s Dice, my ass.
My name is Li’s Z now.

515
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,349
<i>Li'! Z had always wanted
to be boss of the City of God,</i>

516
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:42,187
<i>ever since he was called Li'! Dice.</i>

517
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,311
They're having fun, and not me?

518
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,242
(Woman sobbing)

519
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,413
I want to get out of here.

520
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:01,782
(She screams)

521
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:05,912
What, kid? Your friend took everything.
What do you want?

522
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:15,300
<i>That night, Li'! Dice
satisfied his thirst to kill,</i>

523
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:17,764
<i>though he knew
Shaggy would never forgive him.</i>

524
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,758
(Screaming)

525
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:29,777
<i>To avoid being punished,
he left the City of God.</i>

526
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,859
<i>He had to work hard for peanuts.</i>

527
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:37,951
- What's with you, kid?
- You're an idiot.

528
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,240
Yeah, Benny!

529
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:41,989
<i>Li'! Dice and Benny managed well.</i>

530
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,788
<i>They had the gift of crime.</i>

531
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,379
- You have more than me.
- It was my idea.

532
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,215
<i>The only problem
was running into an older hoodlum</i>

533
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,754
<i>like my brother Goose.</i>

534
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:55,673
Li’s Dice?

535
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:59,298
Shit, man. I thought
you were a goner at the motel.

536
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:02,176
You're fucking loaded!

537
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:06,397
Don't, Benny.
That's our money.

538
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,891
Fuck you. Pass me the money!

539
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:13,897
Benny, tell your brother Shaggy
that Shorty is squealing.

540
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,522
I'm leaving the slum.

541
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,076
Goose!

542
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:25,416
Take it. From Shaggy.
You'll need it.

543
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:48,230
<i>From one hit to the next,
Li'! Dice grew up.</i>

544
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:52,727
<i>At 18, he was the most respected hood
in the City of God.</i>

545
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,853
You're of age now, watch out!

546
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:58,232
<i>He was one of
the most wanted robbers in Rio.</i>

547
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:13,334
Li’s Dice, how's it going?

548
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:17,460
Happy birthday.
I'm so glad you've turned 18.

549
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,007
- Get lost, Tuba!
- Excuse me, amigo.

550
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:23,636
Give me a beer!

551
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,851
Didn't you see me, prick?
You didn't see me?

552
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:27,970
What's up, man?

553
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:33,192
Up yours! The next time,
I'll waste you, asshole!

554
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,572
<i>Li'! Dice was ready for anything.</i>

555
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:41,738
I wanna talk.

556
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,360
<i>And he was itching to start.</i>

557
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:46,614
- Who are the fattest cats here?
- There are tons of them.

558
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,160
Look at Jerry Adrian.

559
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:53,204
Gold chain, snazzy clothes.

560
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,252
Look at Perspire
and the chick he's with.

561
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:59,046
Bernice. She was my brother's girl.

562
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:01,011
Check out his car.

563
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:05,133
Then there's Black.
Covered in gold.

564
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:08,101
Gold chain, gold watch.

565
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:11,392
Look at Carrot, and his car.

566
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:13,265
They're all dealers.

567
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,267
They're all fucking loaded.

568
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:19,818
Hold-ups bring in chicken shit.
The big bucks are in drugs.

569
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:22,737
- I see.
- Especially in selling coke.

570
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:25,361
- But you need money.
- Not really.

571
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:29,364
We'll kill these clowns
and take over their business.

572
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,083
- When do we start?
- Now.

573
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:45,639
Eu-the-Devil
is the light that shines forth.

574
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:48,475
He brought you here.

575
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:53,769
Why remain in the City of God,
where God has forgotten you?

576
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,480
I know what you want.

577
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,102
You want power.

578
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:03,278
I have something
which will give it to you.

579
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:09,405
To change your fate,
I give you my protector, boy.

580
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,204
But you mustn't fornicate
with the amulet,

581
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:15,873
otherwise...

582
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:19,339
...you’ll die.

583
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:24,503
The boy is no longer called Li’s Dice,
but Li’s Z.

584
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:28,223
Li’s Z will grow up.

585
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:32,345
You'll stick with me,
I'll stick with you.

586
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:47,234
<i>Li'! Dice became Li'! Z
and he began to kill.</i>

587
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:52,490
<i>He started one morning,
taking over Jerry Adriana’s racket.</i>

588
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:55,117
<i>He spent all day on the job.</i>

589
00:45:56,129 --> 00:46:00,498
<i>By night, almost all of the rackets
in the slum were his.</i>

590
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:03,751
<i>The only business
he didn't touch was Carrot's,</i>

591
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,843
<i>since he was a friend of Benny's.</i>

592
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:09,465
<i>All that was left was the apartment.
But that would be easy.</i>

593
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,052
(Knocking)

594
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,678
Who is it?

595
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:19,016
Go see.

596
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:25,898
- Hey, Black.
- Fuck, Li’s Dice.

597
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:28,025
You show up like this at my place?

598
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:30,619
Who said it was your place?

599
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:33,239
- Yeah, who?
- Something wrong, Li’s Dice?

600
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:36,583
Li’s Dice, my ass.
My name is Li’s Z now.

601
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:37,701
Li’s Z, see?

602
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:41,080
- You're a goner, bastard.
- Don't kill him. He understands.

603
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,205
Right, Black?

604
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,508
It's all yours.

605
00:46:46,596 --> 00:46:48,178
I don't want no trouble, OK?

606
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:51,424
<i>I should have taken this chance
to avenge my brother's death.</i>

607
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:53,015
(Gunshot)

608
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:57,138
You'll live, but you'll work for us.

609
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:58,263
Understand?

610
00:46:58,399 --> 00:46:59,810
<i>That's easy to say.</i>

611
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:04,277
- Where are you going?
- He's clean, Li’s Z.

612
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:06,942
What's your name, kid?

613
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:10,864
- Rocket.
- He's Goose's brother.

614
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:13,077
- Goose?
- The late Goose.

615
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:18,033
Quick, kid. Run along.

616
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,912
Tell everyone that this business
now belongs to Li's Z.

617
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:25,916
And that we'll be selling coke.
Got that?

618
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:27,884
Cocaine.

619
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:34,049
- Where's the turf?
- Over there, on the left.

620
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:37,177
<i>Selling drugs
is like any other business.</i>

621
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:39,429
<i>The supplier
delivers the merchandise,</i>

622
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,353
<i>which is then packaged
on the premises.</i>

623
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:46,649
<i>It's done in an assembly line.</i>

624
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:49,614
<i>Boring as hell.</i>

625
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:53,280
<i>Pot is wrapped up in "lids".</i>

626
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:56,246
<i>Cocaine is put into packets,</i>

627
00:47:56,374 --> 00:48:01,210
<i>and then into bundles of 10 or 100.</i>

628
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:03,704
<i>You can even make a career
in dealing drugs.</i>

629
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:08,542
<i>The kids start out as delivery boys.</i>

630
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:13,468
<i>They're paid to run errands
and take messages.</i>

631
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,135
<i>Then they become lookouts.</i>

632
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:16,679
<i>If the police arrive,</i>

633
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:19,519
<i>the kites disappear
and everyone scrams.</i>

634
00:48:20,857 --> 00:48:24,976
<i>Later, you become
a dealer or a "vapor".</i>

635
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:27,819
<i>When the heat's on,
the "vapor" quickly evaporates.</i>

636
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:32,032
<i>Moving up the ladder,
you have the "soldier".</i>

637
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,994
<i>And if the guy is good at maths,
he can become a manager,</i>

638
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:39,535
<i>the boss's right-hand man.</i>

639
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:44,620
<i>The police receive their part
and don't make trouble.</i>

640
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:49,875
<i>Since Li'! Zr killed off
all of his enemies,</i>

641
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:53,129
<i>there were no shoot-outs
in the City of God.</i>

642
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:54,880
<i>You could drive there.</i>

643
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:58,805
<i>The playboys felt safe
buying their drugs there.</i>

644
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:05,232
<i>The City teemed with addicts
and Li'! Z grew rich.</i>

645
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,150
- Do you want to try some?
- Cheers, mate.

646
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:15,860
- Can't decide which to wear.
- This one's cool.

647
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:18,362
<i>If dealing were legal,</i>

648
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:22,742
<i>Li'! Z would have been
man of the year.</i>

649
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:27,371
<i>But things were risky for me.
I was afraid of him.</i>

650
00:49:27,507 --> 00:49:29,839
<i>And he was everywhere.</i>

651
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,674
What a drag this guy is.

652
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:36,467
<i>Whenever I wanted to smoke a joint,
I had to go see Carrot.</i>

653
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:43,345
Half a lid.

654
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,267
Thanks.

655
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:49,643
<i>But it was worth it.
I only smoked with Angelica.</i>

656
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:54,527
<i>She and Ti ago had split up,
so lamed my move.</i>

657
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:57,071
<i>I was about to win her over.</i>

658
00:49:57,203 --> 00:50:00,446
These pictures are really great.

659
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:03,994
- You think so?
- I look good here.

660
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,959
- You look beautiful everywhere.
- I'm serious.

661
00:50:07,088 --> 00:50:08,328
Me too.

662
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:16,004
<i>A setting sun, a deserted beach,
a long kiss.</i>

663
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,179
<i>I was sure this was it.</i>

664
00:50:20,393 --> 00:50:22,725
<i>But the Runts arrived.</i>

665
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:26,429
Can I have a toke?

666
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,770
Here.

667
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:37,691
- I'm going. See you later.
- You're leaving?

668
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:39,363
She's leaving!

669
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:41,327
Hold on, Angelica.

670
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:45,198
- Your joint, man.
- Keep it.

671
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:47,166
What a cool guy.

672
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:56,051
<i>That was my first run-in
with the Runts.</i>

673
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:04,517
- Steak and fries, Benny.
- Great!

674
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:09,059
Here.

675
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:13,898
- A tip for you.
- Really? Thanks.

676
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:15,520
- Wanna eat something?
- No.

677
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,150
Wanna trade this watch?

678
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:25,997
<i>After Angelica left him,
Ti ago began snorting more and more.</i>

679
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:29,208
- Is it your grandfather's?
- No, my dad's.

<i>When a guy ls really hooked,
he ends up in the hands of the dealer.</i>

681
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,957
- Two bags often.
- One often.

682
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,083
OK, one bag.

683
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:40,553
<i>For Ti ago, it was different.</i>

684
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:44,265
- Watch out!
- Sorry, Godfather.

685
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:47,431
Godfather, my ass.
Did I baptist your kids?

686
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:50,521
- I'm sorry.
- Now beat it.

687
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:57,103
Black, lend me your bike.

688
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:23,005
Hey, wanna race?

689
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:27,134
- Where to?
- Up to the highway.

690
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:30,261
- OK.
- Ready? Go!

691
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:53,784
Pretty tough, wasn't it?

692
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:56,413
Yeah, you're good.

693
00:52:56,549 --> 00:53:00,588
- Where'd you buy those sneakers?
- Not far from here.

694
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,678
- The shirt as well?
- No, uptown.

695
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:06,764
- Cool.
- It's a designer shirt.

696
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,054
If I give you money,
can you buy me one?

697
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,598
Shorts and a shirt?

698
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:15,815
Buy whatever you can.

699
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:21,445
- What size are you?
- Measure me.

700
00:53:21,574 --> 00:53:24,407
- With what, man?
- Shit, with your hand.

701
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,653
- Shoe size?
- Seven.

702
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:30,621
Turn around.

703
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:38,959
Hey,Benny!

704
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:42,379
You got the digs?

705
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:49,679
- Just one pair of pants?
- No, there's more.

706

- You like it?
- Yeah.

707
00:53:56,484 --> 00:53:58,691
There's some change.

708
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:02,187
- Keep it.
- Cool.

709
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:12,451
This is Benny.

710

- This is Rocket.
- Hi. I know him.

711
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:44,608
I've become a playboy.

712

Hey, gangsters, listen to this.

713
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:53,283
Watch out.

Fuck off, you bastards!

717

Benny, didn't I tell you
to shoot Carrot?

721
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,737
He's endangering the slum.

722
00:55:34,874 --> 00:55:38,287
- Cool it. Go talk to him.
- I'm gonna kill that fucker.

723
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:41,502
- Stop trying to wipe out everyone.
- I'm gonna kill him.

724
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:46,758
Don't worry, Angelica.
The guys in here are cool.

725
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:49,628
Sure, I'm not worried.

726
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:53,089
You gonna dance, Benny?
What about Carrot?

727
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:58,311
Go talk to the guy.

728
00:55:58,439 --> 00:56:02,023
<i>Benny was the coolest hood
in the City of God.</i>

<i>Li'! Z was the opposite.</i>

<i>He wanted an excuse
to take over Carrot's racket.</i>

- Hey, Carrot.
- What's up?

734
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:21,459
You shouldn't let the Runts
do hold-ups in the slum.

735
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:26,673
You look after your section,
I'll look after mine. Got that?

736
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,916
I'm gonna get a drink.

- No problem.

My parents are out.
You'll be all alone with her.

You can lose your virginity tonight.

Not so loud, man!
Everyone will hear.

Shit!

Look, man, I know the Runts
are associated with you.

Think I'm a sucker, you little brat?

755

You want to take my racket?

756

I want to talk to you

Get your hand away!

758
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,531
The Runts are screwing up

Wait, Rocket.

760
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,658
Give the baby his bottle.

761
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:47,287
Carrot,
just ask the kids to cool it, OK?

762
00:57:47,423 --> 00:57:50,666
He's useless.
He lets the Runts do hold-ups.

763
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:53,919
The police come around,
and that's bad for business.

764
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:58,264
I'll do it only because I like you.

765
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:00,224
But you need to change
that baby's nappy.

766

I'll show you who's the baby.

767

Tell the kids that in my slum
no-one robs or rapes!

No wonder you're "Little" Z!

00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,046
You rob me all the time!

- Let's go.
- Don't hurt the Runts.

780
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:00,655
I won't touch them.

781

Don't worry,
no one gets through.

- How's it going, Li’s Z?

783
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:10,332
- Wanna take a walk, Steak?
- With you? Hold on.

784
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:14,749
Mum, I'm going out with my friends.

785

That's the best chicken I ever ate.

786
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:32,608
The old guy was scared shirtless.

787
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:35,603
Feeling sorry for him?

788
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:37,696
You're crazy, man!

789
00:59:37,825 --> 00:59:39,031
(Burps)

790
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:40,615
(Laughter)

791
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:48,950
Why not stick up a bank
or a supermarket?

792
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:53,580
- Peanuts. Drugs are where it's at.
- Yeah, selling drugs.

793
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,297
Shut up!

794
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,713
But you have to start out
as a delivery boy.

795
00:59:58,846 --> 01:00:00,462
You wanna be a delivery boy?

796
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:05,717
It's a rip-off.
It takes a long time to move up.

797
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:10,097
You have to wait till
an older guy gets killed to move up.

798
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:11,973
I don't wanna wait
till some guy croaks.

799
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:15,943
I'm gonna do what Li’s Z did.
I'm gonna wipe them all out.

800
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:19,526
Talking about me, kid?
The boss is here.

801
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,202
Come back, you brat!

802
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:33,085
Where do you think you're going?

803
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:35,170
They're quick, those kids.

804
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:36,960
They run fast.

805
01:00:37,092 --> 01:00:40,380
- They're all gone except you.
- Any others?

806
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:51,053
You're gonna pay
for the ones that escaped.

807
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:54,979
You choose.
Shall I shoot you in the hand or foot?

808
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:57,522
Come on, choose!

809
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:00,442
Hand or foot?

810
01:01:03,035 --> 01:01:05,868
- Choose, for fuck's sake!
- Come on!

811
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:13,367
Come on, choose!

812
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:16,621
- Hand.
- The little hand, eh?

813
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:27,594
Cool.

814
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:33,263
Hey, Steakhouses,
let's see what you're made of.

815
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:36,811
Choose and then kill one of them.

816
01:01:36,944 --> 01:01:40,687
- Leave it. I'll do it.
- Butt out, Tuba. This is for him.

817
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:45,491
Go on, Steak.

818
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:48,281
Go on, choose one and shoot.

819
01:01:49,498 --> 01:01:52,365
Come on, I haven't got all day.

820
01:01:52,501 --> 01:01:55,368
Go on, Steak,
choose one and shoot.

821
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:00,206
Go on, I haven't got all day.

822
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:05,303
I wanna see what you're made of.

823
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:10,550
Come on, get it over with.

824
01:02:10,686 --> 01:02:12,768
Come on, I haven't got all day.

825
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:16,309
Well done!

826
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:17,727
You did it.

827
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:20,897
You're one of us.

828
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:23,737
Very good, Steak.

829
01:02:26,118 --> 01:02:31,704
Get up, brat. Go back to your rat hole.

830
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:33,072
Without limping!

831
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:38,419
Tell your buddies
that no-one robs in Li’s Z’s slum.

832
01:02:38,547 --> 01:02:40,538
Go now. And no limping, OK?

833
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:02,109
<i>While Li'! Z was winning
the respect of the residents,</i>

834
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:05,446
<i>Benny was winning Angelica's heart.</i>

835
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:10,861
<i>As for me, I was still a virgin,
single and broke.</i>

836
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:12,987
<i>I had no choice.</i>

837
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:21,208
<i>I had to fake a job in a supermarket'.</i>

838
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:25,925
<i>I worked long hours for chicken feed.
I wanted to be laid off</i>

839
01:03:26,053 --> 01:03:30,468
<i>so I could buy a camera
with the severance pay.</i>

840
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:34,141
<i>But things didn't work out that way.</i>

841
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:40,105
- It's the guy on the beach.
- Hey, bro!

842
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:43,316
- Still smoking good stuff?
- Yeah.

843
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:44,901
That guy's too cool.

844
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,522
Hey, kid. Come here.
Lift up your shirt.

845
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:55,997
We give these kids a chance.
They don't appreciate it.

846
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:59,833
- What about my severance pay?
- What severance pay?

847
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:04,046
<i>That fucking manager
thought I was part of the gang.</i>

848
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:09,214
You're fired for serious misconduct.
Get out. Immediately!

849
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:12,930
<i>I didn't get a single cent.</i>

850
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,854
<i>It was like a message from God.</i>

851
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:34,573
<i>"Honesty doesn't pay, sucker."</i>

852
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:49,876
The bus sure took a long time to come.

853
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:52,218
I should already be at work.

854
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:55,465
Shit, hide that gun.
Are you nuts?

855
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,934
It was Goose's.
It's broken anyway.

856
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,178
The company
doesn't run many buses on this line.

857
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:02,975
It's always someone else.

858
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:08,023
It's my grandfather's fault.

859
01:05:08,155 --> 01:05:09,737
And then they make us squeeze!

860
01:05:09,865 --> 01:05:12,072
Have a nice evening, ma'am.

861
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:17,828
I know that guy.
He lives in the City.

862
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:20,038
He'll recognise us.

863
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:22,625
So? He couldn't care less
if we take his boss's money.

864
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,743
OK. Let's go.

865
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:30,207
Yahveh,boys?
Aren't you from the City of God?

866
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:33,211
Yeah.

867
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:36,008
I'll let one of you through
without paying.

868
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:45,598
You should study
so you can get out of the slum.

869
01:05:45,734 --> 01:05:48,396
- It's too full of cops and hoodlums.
- Did you study?

870
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:51,566
I was in school and in the army.

871
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:55,111
I was the best marksman
in my barracks.

872
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:57,735
This job was
all I could find afterwords.

873
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:02,081
But I do karate.
If I'm hired somewhere,

874
01:06:02,209 --> 01:06:04,371
I'll leave the slum.

875
01:06:04,503 --> 01:06:09,339
- Do you fight, then?
- I'm for peace and love.

876
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:10,956
But if I have to...

877
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:14,175
<i>He didn't know he would have to.</i>

878
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:18,218
<i>But not yet. It's not time
to tell Knockout Ned's story.</i>

879
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:20,967
- We should be going.
- Let's go.

880
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:22,263
- Goodbye.
- Thanks.

881
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:24,227
See you.

882
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:31,652
I couldn't do it.
He was such a cool guy.

883
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:35,694
Yeah, totally.
That's Person’s brother.

884
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,816
Let's go home.

885
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:45,370
- No way! That bakery's empty.
- What will you say?

886
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:49,666
I don't know. "This is a hold-up."

887
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:52,831
Here's my number.

888
01:06:52,968 --> 01:06:55,551
- You like soul or groovy?
- Soul.

889
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:57,716
<i>That one didn't work either.</i>

890
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:01,215
<i>The counter girl was just too foxy.
And she flirted with me.</i>

891
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:02,591
Will you call me?

892
01:07:03,895 --> 01:07:07,388
I couldn't pull a gun on her,
she was such a cool girl.

893
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:09,390
Yeah, I agree.

894
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:13,560
Excuse me.

895
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:19,446
I'm lost. How do I get to Barr?

896
01:07:19,578 --> 01:07:20,568
- To Barr?
- Yes.

897
01:07:20,704 --> 01:07:23,696
<i>I thought, "Tough luck
for this guy from 50s Paulo. "</i>

898
01:07:23,832 --> 01:07:27,746
- We were going there.
- You're kidding.

899
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:31,120
- You're a lifesaver.
- That's right.

900
01:07:32,299 --> 01:07:35,792
<i>Because no guy from So Paulo
could ever be cool.</i>

901
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:46,469
- The body's over here.
- We found it, chief.

902
01:07:46,605 --> 01:07:48,767
The forensic expert!

903
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:06,705
Not a pretty sight, eh?

904
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:09,120
- What a great singer.
- You like him?

905
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:11,960
I love music. What about you?

906
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:14,580
Tell me, do you also like pot?

907
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:20,423
I can't say. I've never tried it.

908
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:23,889
The devil recognizes his own.

909
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:27,475
Do you have papers?

910
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:32,227
- I've run out.
- I have some.

911
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:36,647
<i>I'd always been an ace
at rolling a joint'.</i>

912
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:39,863
<i>If I'd had the same skill with girls,</i>

913
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:43,985
<i>I'd never have missed
so many chances to lose my virginity.</i>

914
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,454
For a So Paulo guy
you're really cool.

915
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:50,870
Thanks, bro.

916
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:53,960
What did they use?

917
01:08:54,089 --> 01:08:58,253
- A club or a rock.
- And the child?

918
01:08:58,385 --> 01:09:01,503
- Untouched.
- Thank goodness.

919
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:06,974
- How long ago?
- About four hours.

920
01:09:07,102 --> 01:09:08,684
- Can we take it away?
- Go ahead.

921
01:09:10,689 --> 01:09:15,525
The murderer has to be
from the City of God.

922
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:17,643
(Baby crying)

923
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:21,943
(Siren wailing)

924
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:35,877
You bastard! You motherfucker!

925
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:41,925
Did you have to kill
your chick in the slum?

926
01:09:42,053 --> 01:09:44,044
The place is crawling with cops now!

927
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,922
- Come on, Li’s Z.
- Come on? Fuck you!

928
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:49,971
I had to avenge my honor.

929
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:53,641
Her family's turned me in.
You won't have any problems.

930
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:55,935
The cops are everywhere
because of you.

931
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:58,980
- You're dead meat, asshole.
- Let up, Li's Z.

932
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:00,694
You've punished him enough.

933
01:10:00,822 --> 01:10:02,654
You know the law.

934
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:05,774
Anyone who kills in my slum
has to die as an example.

935
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:08,493
That was his business, Li’s Z.

936
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:11,204
Listen, you son of a bitch,
get outta the slum.

937
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:13,414
You showed no respect, understand?

938
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:16,626
Don't fuck up again!

939
01:10:16,755 --> 01:10:18,245
You know what, Benny?

940
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:22,215
You're too nice. If you raise a snake,
expect to get bitten.

941
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:25,461
He wasn't worth shit.

942
01:10:25,597 --> 01:10:28,510
- A dirty traitor.
- Shut up, Tuba.

943
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:30,973
I'm going for a walk with my girl.

944
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:35,562
Don't take too long, though.

945
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:39,604
When things calm down, we'll get back
to our business with Carrot, OK?

946
01:10:44,616 --> 01:10:47,108
You need a girlfriend, Li’s Zr.

947
01:11:07,806 --> 01:11:10,047
Know what I'm thinking, Benny?

948
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:13,350
That I'm so sexy?

949
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:17,096
That too. But I mean,
you know what we could do?

950
01:11:17,232 --> 01:11:21,146
- Make love again.
- I'm serious.

951
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:25,987
We could go away from here.
This violence sucks.

952
01:11:27,242 --> 01:11:28,573
Go where?

953
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:31,451
To a farm.

954
01:11:33,081 --> 01:11:36,745
We're really hippies at heart,
aren't we?

955
01:11:38,253 --> 01:11:40,085
A farm?

956
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:46,208
Peace and love?

957
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:13,159

<i>The religious crowd.</i>

963
01:12:37,812 --> 01:12:39,268
I'll pay you a visit at the church.

964
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:41,934
Thanks for coming to my party.

- Want to dance with me?
- Huh?

970
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:21,720
- Want to dance with me?
- I didn't hear...

971
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:26,601
- Want to dance?
- No, thank you, I'm with someone.

972
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:42,790
Hey, Rocket!

973
01:13:56,683 --> 01:13:59,516
Come, I want to talk to you, buddy.

974
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:03,386
You can't just split with that chick.

975
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:08,563
Why not? I'm gonna go live on a farm,
smoke pot, listen to rock.

976
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:12,563
You wanna throw away everything
for that bitch?

977
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:16,650
She's not a bitch, she's my girl.

978
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:19,073
We'll take over Carrot's business.
It'll be yours.

979
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:22,288
- Carrot's a good guy.
- He's a motherfucker!

980
01:14:22,417 --> 01:14:26,035
Everyone's a motherfucker to you.
That's why I'm leaving.

981
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:30,084
I'm your friend.
I don't want to fight.

982
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:32,457
You got to understand, I have to go.

983
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:38,054
I love you, man, but I've had enough.

984
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:39,946
Motherfucker,
let's see if you have any balls.

985

You wanna die? Fuck off, bitch!

Strip, nigger.
I wanna see your ass.

Hurry up! Take it all off!

I want to see you naked.
Take it off!

Show your ass to everyone!

991

Stop it, please.

992
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:18,446
You loser!

993
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,190
Take it off!

994
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:34,583
What's up, Benny?

995
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:36,456
This camera for a bag of coke?

996

I don't deal any more.

997
01:16:38,553 --> 01:16:41,136
Come on, do it for me.
You're my friend.

998

- Is it stolen?
- It's OK, it's my dad's.

Your dad's?

Give it t Li’s Z.

1001
01:16:50,857 --> 01:16:53,519
Rocket would love this camera.

1002

- Great.

1003

Shit, dude! This is great!

1007

Now move your ass.

Shake it!

1009
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:59,418
You'll take some great pictures.

1010
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:04,340
Give me that.

1011

Where's the motherfucker who did it?

1018

Black’s here.

1027

I'm fucked.

- Why?
- I'm fucked. And you are too.

1030
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:08,210
I think I killed Benny.
Li’s Z's coming to take your place.

1031

We can get him,
he's in the dance hall.

1032
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:12,513
You killed Benny?

1033
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:16,475
I didn't mean to. He moved.
I was aiming at Li’s Z.

1034
01:20:16,604 --> 01:20:18,470
Come on, let's go.

1035

Black.

1036

You killed the coolest hood
in the City of God.

1037
01:20:24,028 --> 01:20:25,439
Let's get Li’s Z...

- Let me through.
- Gimme a kiss, girl.

1045

Let me through, please.
Have you seen what you look like?

1046

You're mine now.

I can't even look her in the face now.

01:22:52,343 --> 01:22:54,334
I can't.

1064

Why didn't that fucker kill me?

1065

Hold on.

1066

Why didn't I kill that fucker?

1067

Let's go back.

- What about Carrot?
- Let's go back.

1069

You gonna kill him?

1070
01:23:22,456 --> 01:23:26,415
Knockout Ned, motherfucker!
Come out, you loser!

1071
01:23:27,795 --> 01:23:29,786
Take it easy.

1072
01:23:31,924 --> 01:23:33,380
I'm going out.

1073
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:35,500
Let me go.

1074
01:23:48,524 --> 01:23:51,607
- Person!
- Come back, son!

1075
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:05,989
This doesn't concern you, kid.
We're here for your brother.

1076
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:09,538
Let's talk. We can work it out.
My brother's a peaceful guy.

1077
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:13,129
Is he too good-looking
to come talk to me? Call him.

1078

He hasn't done anything.

1079
01:24:14,592 --> 01:24:18,460
Are you crazy?
You know who I am?

- Li’s Z, man.
- He's Li’s Z.

Call that motherfucker!

1082

Go on, man.

1083
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:34,775
Calm down. I'll call him.

1084
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:12,267
I hurt my arm.
Carrot will have to wait.

1085
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:15,107
That loser got what he deserved.

1086
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:17,067
Let's g!

Person.

1090

That bastard killed my brother.

1091
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:59,064
I can't let that go.

1092
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:10,237
So?

1093
01:26:14,503 --> 01:26:16,244
Want a gun?

1094
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:19,589
- My son.
- Calm down, Mum.

1095
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:23,592
Please, Mum.

1096
01:26:32,688 --> 01:26:37,899
- Do it right, asshole.
- There's no other way.

1097
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:40,609
How did I let that loser hit me?

1098
01:26:40,738 --> 01:26:43,981
Shit, it's deep.

1099
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:46,107
(Gunshots)

1100
01:27:12,603 --> 01:27:15,937
- It's as if we were brothers.
- Shut up.

1101
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:20,103
Both of us hurt in the arm.
You by one brother, me the other.

1102
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:23,773
- Shut up!
- That was incredible!

1103
01:27:23,906 --> 01:27:26,614
- Shut up!
- That Knockout Ned's not bad, eh?

1104
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:29,860
He came out of nowhere.

1105
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:31,326
(Gunshot)

1106
01:27:31,455 --> 01:27:35,198
Shut up,Tuba!
You're a fucking pain!

1107
01:27:42,883 --> 01:27:47,047
<i>It was as if the Cl(y of God
had suddenly found a hero.</i>

1108
01:27:47,179 --> 01:27:49,295
God bless you, son.

1109
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:52,924
That kid was just asking
to be killed.

1110
01:27:55,938 --> 01:27:57,770
Keep cool.

1111
01:27:59,191 --> 01:28:00,852
You did a good job.

1112
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:03,396
You'd better go hide.

1113
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:08,860
<i>I thought Knockout Ned
would start a revolution here.</i>

1114
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:11,780
<i>But God had other plans.</i>

1115
01:28:11,912 --> 01:28:15,701
Steak, where are all the dealers?

1116
01:28:15,833 --> 01:28:19,167
They're hiding.
Li’s Z is in a bad mood.

1117
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:23,083
They get us hooked
and then they go off and hide.

1118
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:26,207
Do me a favour.
Go get some nose candy for me.

1119
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:28,049
<i>I'll try.</i>

1120
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:32,172
Tell them it's for Ti ago,
to keep my buzz going.

1121
01:28:47,364 --> 01:28:48,980
(Glass shatters)

1122
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:54,610
Steakhouses,

1123
01:28:55,581 --> 01:28:58,073
go to Carrot's and tell him.

1124
01:28:58,208 --> 01:29:00,916
Li’s Z says
that if you kill Knockout,

1125
01:29:01,044 --> 01:29:02,910
he'll leave you alone.

1126
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:06,914
Hey, Knockout Ned.
Did you hear that?

1127
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:09,542
Grab the kid!

1128
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:13,545
You heard the boy?

1129
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:17,676
If you don't stick with us,
you're dead.

1130
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:21,679
I think you should join us.
We'll be partners.

1131
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:24,728
Drugs aren't my thing.

1132
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:27,022
This is just something
between me and him.

1133
01:29:28,906 --> 01:29:31,898
Those guys aren't worth shit.

1134
01:29:32,034 --> 01:29:35,527
They'll do anything for power.

1135
01:29:35,662 --> 01:29:36,652
Got the kid.

1136
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:42,500
Like that kid.
They're all robots, like this punk here.

1137
01:29:42,628 --> 01:29:43,959
What's in your head, kid?

1138
01:29:45,339 --> 01:29:47,831
Can't you see
you're wrecking your life

1139
01:29:47,966 --> 01:29:52,130
with that maniac
and a bunch of trigger-happy fools?

1140
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:56,381
Are you crazy?

1141
01:29:56,516 --> 01:29:58,553
- You're just a kid.
- A kid?

1142
01:29:58,685 --> 01:30:03,725
I smoke, snort,
I've killed and robbed. I'm a man.

1143
01:30:03,857 --> 01:30:06,519
Shit, you have no idea!

1144
01:30:06,652 --> 01:30:09,644
You should join up with us.

1145
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:10,941
Shall we kill him?

1146
01:30:11,073 --> 01:30:15,192
Steak, we're going to grind you.

1147
01:30:16,662 --> 01:30:20,826
- OK, I accept.
- Great!

1148
01:30:20,958 --> 01:30:25,122
Tell your boss that Knockout Ned
and Carrot are in command.

1149
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:26,664
But on one condition.

1150
01:30:27,714 --> 01:30:31,378
No killing of innocent people.

1151
01:30:33,053 --> 01:30:35,795
I can't accept that, understand?

1152
01:30:35,931 --> 01:30:38,548
OK, no innocent people.

1153
01:30:38,684 --> 01:30:41,642
No innocent people.

1154
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:44,182
Steak fucked up!

1155
01:30:49,027 --> 01:30:50,893
Cool it, little shit!

1156
01:30:58,495 --> 01:30:59,906
Have you got a gun for me?

1157
01:31:00,038 --> 01:31:04,498
No, but we can hold up a gun store.

1158
01:31:04,626 --> 01:31:06,788
No problem.

1159
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:10,879
I don't want to hold up anything.
I'm not a hoodlum.

1160
01:31:11,008 --> 01:31:14,421
This is a personal affair
between me and him, OK?

1161
01:31:14,553 --> 01:31:17,386
I'm not a hoodlum.

1162
01:31:19,599 --> 01:31:21,590
He raped your chick,

1163
01:31:21,727 --> 01:31:25,561
killed your uncle and brother,
gunned your house,

1164
01:31:25,689 --> 01:31:28,681
and you killed one of his guys.

1165
01:31:33,655 --> 01:31:37,398
If you're not a hood, then get out.

1166
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:49,535
- It's a hold-up!
- This is a hold-up!

1167
01:31:58,638 --> 01:32:00,174
<i>The first time...</i>

1168
01:32:00,307 --> 01:32:02,048
Where are the revolvers?

1169
01:32:02,184 --> 01:32:06,018
<i>...Knockout Ned saved a sales
assistant from being shot by Carrot.</i>

1170
01:32:06,146 --> 01:32:10,561
We said no killing!

1171
01:32:10,692 --> 01:32:12,182
That's the rule.

1172
01:32:13,904 --> 01:32:18,319
We want the boss's money.
Everyone keep calm.

1173
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:22,318
You want us to go? We do too.

1174
01:32:22,454 --> 01:32:25,947
Come on, give me the money!

1175
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:27,073
Look at the ground!

1176
01:32:27,209 --> 01:32:30,201
<i>The second time,
Carrot saved Knockout Ned's life.</i>

1177
01:32:33,048 --> 01:32:36,461
<i>Ned learned that
there's an exception to every rule.</i>

1178
01:32:36,593 --> 01:32:38,584
Exception to the rule.

1179
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:42,721
- Are you the manager?
- Yes.

1180
01:32:42,849 --> 01:32:46,934
This is a hold-up.
Everyone on the ground!

1181
01:32:47,062 --> 01:32:48,427
On the ground!

1182
01:32:50,982 --> 01:32:52,564
Give me the money!

1183
01:32:56,530 --> 01:32:58,737
I'm not kidding.

1184
01:32:58,865 --> 01:33:01,197
The first person
who moves is dead!

1185
01:33:01,326 --> 01:33:05,240
<i>The third time,
the exception becomes the rule.</i>

1186
01:33:20,971 --> 01:33:22,461
<i>With the hold-up money,</i>

1187
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:25,510
<i>Carrot and Knockout Ned
prepared to face Li'! Zr'.</i>

1188
01:33:25,642 --> 01:33:28,600
<i>Carrot could protect his business.</i>

1189
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:30,435
<i>Knockout Ned,</i>

1190
01:33:30,564 --> 01:33:33,556
<i>the best marksman in his battalion,
wanted revenge.</i>

1191
01:33:33,692 --> 01:33:37,981
First, the Italians. This is a mm.

1192
01:33:38,697 --> 01:33:40,859
- Let me see.
- Not bad, eh?

1193
01:33:40,991 --> 01:33:42,573
The sight isn't well-aligned.

1194
01:33:42,701 --> 01:33:45,864
I'll give you a good price.

1195
01:33:45,996 --> 01:33:49,364
The mm. The "hand job".

1196
01:33:49,499 --> 01:33:50,534
See why?

1197
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:53,785
An Uzi, mm. It's Israeli.

1198
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,661
The Star of David.

1199
01:33:55,797 --> 01:33:58,414
- Jewish.
- I want a 30-06.

1200
01:33:59,301 --> 01:34:02,419
Now we can start having fun.

1201
01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:05,888
The war's on.
Let's start with a prayer.

1202
01:34:06,016 --> 01:34:10,556
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

1203
01:34:10,687 --> 01:34:12,894
Thy kingdom come.

1204
01:34:13,023 --> 01:34:17,608
Thy will be done in earth,
as it is in heaven.

1205
01:34:17,736 --> 01:34:20,103
Give us this day our daily bread.

1206
01:34:20,238 --> 01:34:22,070
And forgive us our trespasses,

1207
01:34:22,199 --> 01:34:25,442
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1208
01:34:25,577 --> 01:34:27,659
And lead us not into temptation,

1209
01:34:27,787 --> 01:34:29,903
but deliver us from evil.
Amen.

1210
01:34:30,832 --> 01:34:32,994
<i>Hoodlums have guns, but can't shoot.</i>

1211
01:34:33,126 --> 01:34:37,336
<i>One bullet from Knockout Ned
was worth ten from Li'! Z's gang.</i>

1212
01:34:37,464 --> 01:34:41,674
<i>Li'! Z couldn't take it.
He counter-attacked.</i>

1213
01:34:44,262 --> 01:34:48,551
<i>The slum had been purgatory.
Now it was hell.</i>

1214
01:34:52,604 --> 01:34:54,766
<i>I decided to get out.</i>

1215
01:34:54,898 --> 01:34:57,981
<i>That's how I became a reporter.</i>

1216
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:03,604
Great photo!
I bet it's by Rogelio Reich.

1217
01:35:05,242 --> 01:35:07,574
What did I tell you?

1218
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:09,363
<i>Like any pro,</i>

1219
01:35:09,496 --> 01:35:13,740
<i>I started at the bottom.
Way down at the bottom.</i>

1220
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:17,368
<i>Without knowing what awaited me.</i>

1221
01:35:19,089 --> 01:35:21,956
<i>Instead of going home,
I'd go over to the paper.</i>

1222
01:35:22,092 --> 01:35:25,756
<i>A guy from the City of God
worked in the lab.</i>

1223
01:35:25,887 --> 01:35:28,470
Check this out.

1224
01:35:28,598 --> 01:35:32,592
<i>He helped me move closer
to what I loved most In life.</i>

1225
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:34,718
- Hi, Rogelio.
- How are you, Pierre?

1226
01:35:34,854 --> 01:35:37,471
This is Rocket.
He's a photographer.

1227
01:35:37,607 --> 01:35:39,018
Hello, Rocket.

1228
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:40,686
- He's a fan of yours.
- Really?

1229
01:35:40,819 --> 01:35:43,060
You have good taste, Rocket!

1230
01:35:43,196 --> 01:35:46,439
- Well, I'm done. I'm off.
- See you.

1231
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:49,316
What a cool guy!

1232
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:53,203
<i>What should have been
a swift revenge</i>

1233
01:35:53,331 --> 01:35:55,743
<i>turned into an all-out war.</i>

1234
01:36:01,047 --> 01:36:03,379
<i>The City of God was divided.</i>

1235
01:36:03,508 --> 01:36:07,342
<i>You couldn't go
from one section to the other.</i>

1236
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:09,211
<i>Not even to visit a relative.</i>

1237
01:36:09,347 --> 01:36:13,762
<i>The cops considered anyone
living in the slum a hoodlum.</i>

1238
01:36:13,893 --> 01:36:17,306
<i>People got used to living in Vietnam.</i>

1239
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:26,695
<i>And more and more volunteers
kept signing up to die.</i>

1240
01:36:26,823 --> 01:36:28,655
- This kid...
- What do you want?

1241
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:30,945
A boy from Carrot's gang punched me.

1242
01:36:31,077 --> 01:36:32,988
<i>The war
was an excuse for everything.</i>

1243
01:36:33,121 --> 01:36:34,862
Li’s Z's soldiers kicked my ass.

1244
01:36:34,998 --> 01:36:38,912
Take this .22.

1245
01:36:40,754 --> 01:36:43,212
The jerk who raped my sister
is with Carrot.

1246
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:44,796
Li’s Z evicted my family.

1247
01:36:44,924 --> 01:36:46,210
I'm unemployed...

1248
01:36:46,343 --> 01:36:47,458
Kill... Be respected.

1249
01:36:47,594 --> 01:36:49,881
A guy from Li’s Z's gang
is messing up with my sister.

1250
01:36:59,856 --> 01:37:02,598
I'm Ti ago, a friend of Benny's.

1251
01:37:02,734 --> 01:37:05,396
- Can you read? Can you add?
- Yes.

1252
01:37:05,528 --> 01:37:08,941
I'm pretty good in business.

1253
01:37:09,074 --> 01:37:10,940
OK, get to work.

1254
01:37:11,076 --> 01:37:14,819
- What do you want?
- To get my father's murderer.

1255
01:37:14,954 --> 01:37:17,992
- What's your name?
- My name's Otto.

1256
01:37:23,463 --> 01:37:25,500
What's the matter?

1257
01:37:25,632 --> 01:37:29,591
- He's a worker.
- But he wants a gun.

1258
01:37:30,387 --> 01:37:33,049
He won't last a week.

1259
01:37:37,977 --> 01:37:39,968
(Shouting and cheering)

1260
01:37:44,025 --> 01:37:48,815
<i>A year later, no-one remembered
how it' had all begun.</i>

1261
01:37:48,947 --> 01:37:51,314
Take that!

1262
01:37:53,368 --> 01:37:57,953
<i>For both sides, the aim was
to take over the enemy's business</i>

1263
01:37:58,081 --> 01:38:02,826
<i>in order to buy more guns
and take over more businesses.</i>

1264
01:38:24,774 --> 01:38:29,519
<i>smokeless, snort',
I've killed and robbed. I'm a man.</i>

1265
01:38:41,166 --> 01:38:42,998
(Cocks gun)

1266
01:38:45,211 --> 01:38:47,122
(Gunshot)

1267
01:38:52,051 --> 01:38:54,088
<i>The media started taking an interest.</i>

1268
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:57,429
<i>The police had to intervene.</i>

1269
01:38:57,640 --> 01:38:59,881
(Agonizing screams)

1270
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:15,655
<i>A gang leader from the City of God
was arrested today.</i>

1271
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:17,615
<i>Manuel Mach ado, aka Knockout Ned,</i>

1272
01:39:17,744 --> 01:39:20,987
<i>was hospitalized
after being wounded by Li'! Zr"s gang.</i>

1273
01:39:21,122 --> 01:39:23,409
<i>Our reporter interviewed him.</i>

1274
01:39:23,541 --> 01:39:27,830
<i>- Is the war still going on?
- It's still going on.</i>

1275
01:39:27,962 --> 01:39:29,452
<i>Have many people died?</i>

1276
01:39:30,131 --> 01:39:32,463
<i>Many have died.</i>

1277
01:39:32,592 --> 01:39:34,583
<i>Mostly innocent people.</i>

1278
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:38,462
<i>Just knowing me</i>

1279
01:39:38,598 --> 01:39:42,683
<i>is enough to get you killed
by Li'! Zr'.</i>

1280
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:44,392
<i>The police don't go in there?</i>

1281
01:39:44,521 --> 01:39:49,561
<i>They go after me, not him.</i>

1282
01:39:49,692 --> 01:39:53,526
<i>I've been in jail
while he goes on killing undisturbed.</i>

1283
01:39:53,655 --> 01:39:55,612
<i>And they don't arrest him.</i>

1284

<i>(Newsreader) Knockout Ned

1285
01:39:58,493 --> 01:40:00,029
<i>Police Chief Guides</i>

<i>has promised
to arrest both of the gangs.</i>

1287
01:40:12,465 --> 01:40:14,297
Motherfucker!

1288
01:40:14,425 --> 01:40:18,134
I'm the boss here, but he gets
his picture in the paper!

1289
01:40:18,263 --> 01:40:21,597
- Have you found mine?
- Just Knockout Ned's.

1290
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:23,385
Keep looking.

1291
01:40:23,518 --> 01:40:26,180
At least my name's got to be in there.

1292
01:40:26,312 --> 01:40:28,428
- There's nothing.
- Can you read?

1293
01:40:28,565 --> 01:40:31,148
Just the pictures.

1294
01:40:32,110 --> 01:40:33,646
Nothing.

1295
01:40:33,778 --> 01:40:37,646
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

1296
01:40:37,782 --> 01:40:39,272
It's just the want ads.

1297
01:40:39,409 --> 01:40:42,652
I don't care! Read everything!

1298
01:40:42,787 --> 01:40:44,528
But there aren't any articles.

1299
01:40:44,664 --> 01:40:47,122
Want a bullet in your head?

1300
01:40:49,002 --> 01:40:52,666
Gotta show them who's boss here.

1301
01:40:57,635 --> 01:41:01,128
<i>- Give me the camera!
- No way!</i>

1302
01:41:03,558 --> 01:41:06,220
Take my picture, man.

1303
01:41:06,352 --> 01:41:09,561
I can't work it.

1304
01:41:09,689 --> 01:41:11,475
Go ahead.

1305
01:41:11,608 --> 01:41:14,566
I'll hold the Beretta.

1306
01:41:14,694 --> 01:41:16,401
Let me try.

1307
01:41:17,155 --> 01:41:19,738
Back off.

1308
01:41:19,866 --> 01:41:21,072
There's no click.

1309
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:24,659
What a bunch of bozos!

1310
01:41:24,787 --> 01:41:27,825
I'm fucked off with you guys.

1311
01:41:27,957 --> 01:41:29,288
I have an idea.

1312
01:41:29,417 --> 01:41:34,162
I'll go get a guy I know.
Hang loose.

1313
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,211
Here he is.

1314
01:41:39,344 --> 01:41:42,177
Take the camera.

1315
01:41:42,305 --> 01:41:44,763
Well, kid?

1316
01:41:45,975 --> 01:41:48,182
Aren't you a photographer?

1317
01:41:48,311 --> 01:41:51,224
Make the camera work.
We can't do it.

1318
01:41:53,107 --> 01:41:54,848
Take our picture.

1319
01:42:00,198 --> 01:42:03,566
- You fucking broke it.
- It wasn't me.

1320
01:42:03,701 --> 01:42:05,863
I think the problem is here.

1321
01:42:14,837 --> 01:42:17,295
- What's your name?
- Rocket.

1322
01:42:17,423 --> 01:42:19,960
Another picture, Rocket.

1323
01:42:20,093 --> 01:42:22,881
- How about two rows?
- What?

1324
01:42:23,012 --> 01:42:26,801
Two rows.
Everyone with their guns.

1325
01:42:27,558 --> 01:42:29,799
You're outside, for Christ's sake!

1326
01:42:29,936 --> 01:42:33,645
- Talk to him nicely, kid.
- Sorry. Move in, please.

1327
01:42:35,983 --> 01:42:38,600
Another one.

1328
01:42:42,615 --> 01:42:45,277
- I think the roll's finished.
- Show us the pictures.

1329
01:42:45,410 --> 01:42:49,278
- They have to be developed.
- Developed?

1330
01:42:49,414 --> 01:42:50,495
How much is it?

1331
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:56,414
Take this money
and bring back the pictures.

1332
01:42:56,546 --> 01:43:01,757
- I have to remove the film.
- Keep the camera.

1333
01:43:01,884 --> 01:43:06,754
Benny wanted to give it to you.
It's yours.

1334
01:43:06,889 --> 01:43:08,379
Thanks.

1335
01:43:10,476 --> 01:43:12,467
Don't forget the pictures.

1336
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:15,721
The photos, Rocket!

1337
01:43:25,908 --> 01:43:28,240
- Pierre!
- What?

1338
01:43:28,786 --> 01:43:31,448
Can you develop this for me?

1339
01:43:32,874 --> 01:43:36,162
I can't, Rocket.
I could get into trouble.

1340
01:43:36,294 --> 01:43:40,253
It's only for the paper's reporters.
I could risk my job.

1341
01:43:40,381 --> 01:43:42,748
Develop these for me.

1342
01:43:42,884 --> 01:43:45,922
This one too, OK?

1343
01:43:46,053 --> 01:43:48,420
I'm going to lunch.

1344
01:43:48,556 --> 01:43:53,551
- You're lucky. What size?
- What?

1345
01:43:53,686 --> 01:43:56,644
For the enlargement, what size?

1346
01:43:56,773 --> 01:44:00,607
Well... Whatever you think is best.

1347
01:44:20,379 --> 01:44:22,461
- Here.
- Thanks.

1348
01:44:24,717 --> 01:44:25,923
Let's go.

1349
01:44:26,427 --> 01:44:27,838
I'm in deep shit now.

1350
01:44:31,015 --> 01:44:33,006
I'm as good as dead.

1351
01:44:44,821 --> 01:44:46,903
<i>Someone had signed
my death sentence.</i>

1352
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:50,490
<i>I wanted to bash the jerk's face in.</i>

1353
01:44:56,082 --> 01:44:58,744
Are you Marina?

1354
01:44:58,876 --> 01:45:02,164
Because of you, I'm dead.
You stole my photos.

1355
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:04,333
Dead? Stole? What do you mean?

1356
01:45:04,465 --> 01:45:06,331
Not so loud.

1357
01:45:06,467 --> 01:45:09,755
Not so loud?
I'll be killed because of you.

1358
01:45:09,887 --> 01:45:12,845
You were gone,
your photos were in the lab.

1359
01:45:12,974 --> 01:45:15,261
There's nothing I can do.

1360
01:45:15,393 --> 01:45:18,886
The photos in our lab are photos
to be published in the paper.

1361
01:45:19,021 --> 01:45:22,355
I saw the photos, I published them.

1362
01:45:22,483 --> 01:45:24,690
- You stole them.
- I did not. Here.

1363
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:29,939
- Give them to me.
- Just a second.

1364
01:45:31,033 --> 01:45:32,865
Give them back to me.

1365
01:45:32,994 --> 01:45:34,109
Are there any others?

1366
01:45:34,245 --> 01:45:36,828
Calm down. What's your name?

1367
01:45:37,415 --> 01:45:40,328
- Rocket.
- Rocket?

1368
01:45:41,210 --> 01:45:43,668
Nice to meet you. I'm Marina.

1369
01:45:43,796 --> 01:45:49,132
Now, relax. I have money for you.
For your pictures.

1370
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:54,926
Here, when we use a picture,
we pay the photographer.

1371
01:45:55,057 --> 01:45:57,799
- Do you want to be a photographer?
- Yes.

1372
01:45:57,935 --> 01:45:59,892
Great start! On the front page.

1373
01:46:00,021 --> 01:46:03,639
- How did you get these photos?
- I live there.

1374
01:46:03,774 --> 01:46:08,268
Rocket, no photographer
has ever been able to go in there.

1375
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:14,195
If you could bring us
more pictures of Li’s Z,

1376
01:46:14,327 --> 01:46:16,614
the paper would buy them.

1377
01:46:16,746 --> 01:46:19,454
We'd Pa)' Yo"-

1378
01:46:19,582 --> 01:46:21,744
Could you?

1379
01:46:21,876 --> 01:46:23,787
I don't know.

1380
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:25,502
What's the problem?

1381
01:46:25,630 --> 01:46:28,622
The problem?
I can't go there any more at night.

1382
01:46:28,758 --> 01:46:30,590
And during the day?

1383
01:46:30,718 --> 01:46:31,958
It's too risky.

1384
01:46:34,597 --> 01:46:39,637
Look, man! They've finally
understood that I'm the boss.

1385
01:46:41,812 --> 01:46:43,644
What's your
photographer-friend's name?

1386
01:46:43,773 --> 01:46:45,263
Rocket.

1387
01:46:45,399 --> 01:46:48,357
He's good.
I'll take more to show the others.

1388
01:46:51,364 --> 01:46:55,232
So, Rocket, is it yes or no?

1389
01:46:57,244 --> 01:47:00,236
It's a great opportunity.

1390
01:47:02,583 --> 01:47:04,574
OK.

1391
01:47:04,710 --> 01:47:07,828
You made the right choice.
Very good!

1392
01:47:07,964 --> 01:47:10,456
I'll give you some film, lenses,
and another camera.

1393
01:47:10,591 --> 01:47:15,131
I'll show you the equipment room.

1394
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:18,762
There's another problem.

1395
01:47:18,891 --> 01:47:21,849
- What is it?
- Where can I sleep tonight?

1396
01:47:22,728 --> 01:47:25,140
I can't go back now.

1397
01:47:28,109 --> 01:47:30,441
This is a jemmy.

1398
01:47:30,569 --> 01:47:33,812
- Will you be close up or far away?
- Far away.

1399
01:47:33,948 --> 01:47:35,438
- Can you measure the light?
- Yes.

1400
01:47:35,574 --> 01:47:37,611
Try it.

1401
01:47:39,662 --> 01:47:42,745
Aren't you too close?

1402
01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:47,955
<i>I don't know what made me
go talk to them like that.</i>

1403
01:47:48,087 --> 01:47:50,328
<i>Maybe I was going to die,</i>

1404
01:47:50,464 --> 01:47:53,877
<i>but now I had a camera</i>

1405
01:47:54,010 --> 01:47:57,093
<i>and a chance
to become a photographer.</i>

1406
01:47:57,221 --> 01:47:59,963
Watch out for the dog shit.

1407
01:48:00,099 --> 01:48:04,263
<i>Not to mention
that the night was still young.</i>

1408
01:48:05,021 --> 01:48:07,103
- Want something to eat?
- No, thank you, ma'am.

1409
01:48:07,231 --> 01:48:10,690
Nothing to eat? Nothing to drink?

1410
01:48:10,818 --> 01:48:13,230
<i>A Wm';?</i>

1411
01:48:14,155 --> 01:48:15,896
Try this.

1412
01:48:34,633 --> 01:48:36,624
It's time to go to sleep.

1413
01:48:38,721 --> 01:48:42,134
I'll show you your bed.

1414
01:48:42,266 --> 01:48:48,137
- The water is hot, isn't it?
- Yes. You've never taken a hot shower?

1415
01:48:48,272 --> 01:48:50,559
- No.
- What do you do?

1416
01:48:50,691 --> 01:48:54,104
We heat up the kettle.

1417
01:48:54,236 --> 01:48:57,820
- Why are you standing there?
- What room do I sleep in?

1418
01:48:57,948 --> 01:49:04,411
Unfortunately, there's only one room.
You have to sleep with me.

1419
01:49:04,538 --> 01:49:08,281
<i>I won't go into the details
of my first sexual experience.</i>

1420
01:49:08,417 --> 01:49:10,408
Just relax.

1421
01:49:12,088 --> 01:49:13,999
<i>Because elsewhere</i>

1422
01:49:14,131 --> 01:49:20,127
<i>another more important sex scene
for the slum was taking place.</i>

1423
01:49:20,262 --> 01:49:25,177
<i>Carrot was helping Knockout' Ned escape
without firing a shot.</i>

1424
01:49:26,811 --> 01:49:32,648
<i>The policeman guarding him
was in the willing hands of the nurse.</i>

1425
01:49:33,442 --> 01:49:38,152
<i>And in the meantime, to eliminate Carrot,
Li'! Zr' was investing in munitions.</i>

1426
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:41,489
<i>He invested heavily,
even if he couldn't pay.</i>

1427
01:49:42,493 --> 01:49:45,656
- Remember the double-barrel?
- I already have it.

1428
01:49:45,788 --> 01:49:47,370
This is a repeater rifle.

1429
01:49:47,498 --> 01:49:51,992
You don't have this one, the Browning.
It'll shoot down a plane.

1430
01:49:52,128 --> 01:49:55,291
I'm not shooting down planes.
And the one I asked for?

1431
01:49:55,422 --> 01:49:57,709
The AR-15, Uncle Sam.

1432
01:49:57,842 --> 01:50:03,554
- You can't get them in Brazil.
- Uncle Sam, my ass.

1433
01:50:06,225 --> 01:50:08,512
I have a solution.

1434
01:50:08,644 --> 01:50:10,635
The Rugger. Ever seen one?

1435
01:50:10,771 --> 01:50:15,356
It's like the AR-15.
Same caliber, but lighter.

1436
01:50:15,484 --> 01:50:18,772
With an infrared sight?
400 shots a minute?

1437
01:50:18,904 --> 01:50:21,987
- It depends.
- It depends, my ass!

1438
01:50:22,116 --> 01:50:24,778
Trying to fuck me over?

1439
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:26,400
I'll fuck you over first.

1440
01:50:26,537 --> 01:50:30,075
You leave now
without the money or the guns.

1441
01:50:30,958 --> 01:50:32,073
What do I tell the boss?

1442
01:50:32,209 --> 01:50:36,043
That's your problem.
You'll think of something.

1443
01:50:36,172 --> 01:50:38,209
You heard him, chubby? Get out.

1444
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:41,924
Beat it, fatso.

1445
01:50:42,052 --> 01:50:43,634
<i>Li'! Z had made a big mistake.</i>

1446
01:50:43,762 --> 01:50:48,006
<i>He should have known that behind
every salesman lies a supplier.</i>

1447
01:50:48,142 --> 01:50:50,634
<i>And they don't joke around.</i>

1448
01:50:52,062 --> 01:50:54,053
Have you seen this?

1449
01:50:54,899 --> 01:50:57,391
What do they need an AR-15 for?

1450
01:50:57,526 --> 01:50:59,483
These stories
will push the police to investigate.

1451
01:50:59,612 --> 01:51:03,105
They'll nab you.
And me, along with you.

1452
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:07,655
Think I'm going to give you away?

1453
01:51:11,081 --> 01:51:16,076
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
But don't fuck up again.

1454
01:51:22,927 --> 01:51:24,759
Charlie!

1455
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:27,169
Come here!

1456
01:51:27,806 --> 01:51:30,673
Listen, you tell him.

1457
01:51:30,809 --> 01:51:32,265
(Gunshot)

1458
01:51:32,937 --> 01:51:37,022
Let's go make
that sleazy little dealer pay up.

1459
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:50,948
Come here, kids!

1460
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:55,828
- Do you like chicken?
- It depends.

1461
01:51:55,960 --> 01:52:00,124
We'll eat some chicken
and have Carrot for dessert.

1462
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:03,715
I have a present for you.

1463
01:52:05,678 --> 01:52:07,464
Here.

1464
01:52:08,764 --> 01:52:11,176
A big one for you.

1465
01:52:11,308 --> 01:52:13,515
Are you really giving us these guns?

1466
01:52:13,644 --> 01:52:18,389
Yes, but I want you on my side,
against Carrot.

1467
01:52:18,524 --> 01:52:20,686
Then can we hold up
anyone we want?

1468
01:52:20,818 --> 01:52:23,025
Not in the slum.

1469
01:52:23,153 --> 01:52:26,191
- Can you shoot?
- More or less.

1470
01:52:26,323 --> 01:52:31,318
Hey, you guys, come help these kids.

1471
01:52:33,289 --> 01:52:35,496
I know. You do it like this.

1472
01:52:52,474 --> 01:52:54,340
Get that chicken!

1473
01:53:06,739 --> 01:53:08,070
Come on, let's go.

1474
01:53:08,657 --> 01:53:10,364
If Li’s Z catches you, he'll kill you.

1475
01:53:12,286 --> 01:53:15,244
Yeah, well, he's gotta find me first.

1476
01:53:22,713 --> 01:53:25,330
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!

1477
01:53:25,466 --> 01:53:28,254
Get that chicken!

1478
01:53:28,385 --> 01:53:30,422
Shit! The cops!

1479
01:53:30,554 --> 01:53:32,795
Hell, don't fucking run off!

1480
01:53:32,931 --> 01:53:34,842
Give me that.

1481
01:53:45,944 --> 01:53:48,356
Hey, Melon head! You fucking fag!

1482
01:53:48,489 --> 01:53:51,527
Get the hell out of here!

1483
01:53:51,658 --> 01:53:53,240
Coward!

1484
01:53:53,369 --> 01:53:55,360
Asshole!

1485
01:53:56,413 --> 01:53:59,405
Come on, let them kill each other.

1486
01:53:59,541 --> 01:54:01,532
They can fuck themselves.

1487
01:54:01,668 --> 01:54:03,534
(Kids jeering)

1488
01:54:10,427 --> 01:54:13,044
Rocket! Take a picture of us!

1489
01:54:14,348 --> 01:54:16,760
What are you waiting for?

1490
01:54:33,909 --> 01:54:35,365
(Gunshot)

1491
01:54:37,871 --> 01:54:39,361
What's happening?

1492
01:54:40,249 --> 01:54:41,159
Shit!

1493
01:54:54,805 --> 01:54:56,421
Let's g!

1494
01:55:04,022 --> 01:55:05,854
Run! Run!

1495
01:55:28,964 --> 01:55:31,581
Move, come on.
Move!

1496
01:55:31,717 --> 01:55:33,299
Let's g!

1497
01:55:35,137 --> 01:55:37,845
Kill one of these fagots! Blast him!

1498
01:56:13,884 --> 01:56:16,091
Take it easy. Don't move.

1499
01:56:16,220 --> 01:56:18,336
It hurts, man.

1500
01:56:18,472 --> 01:56:21,885
Easy does it, kid.

1501
01:56:22,017 --> 01:56:24,850
Why did you join this fucking war?

1502
01:56:24,978 --> 01:56:29,017
Knockout Ned!
Li’s Z's been hit. Come on!

1503
01:56:29,149 --> 01:56:32,187
Wait here. Hold on.

1504
01:56:41,245 --> 01:56:44,408
<i>- What's your name?
- My name's Otto.</i>

1505
01:56:52,798 --> 01:56:56,336
<i>I want to get my father's murderer.</i>

1506
01:57:25,038 --> 01:57:27,621
Wait here. Hold on.

1507
01:58:04,244 --> 01:58:06,827
(Sirens wailing)

1508
01:58:07,456 --> 01:58:09,447
The fucking cops!

1509
01:58:11,251 --> 01:58:12,833
On the ground!

1510
01:58:12,961 --> 01:58:14,747
- Hands over your head.
- Don't move!

1511
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:16,917
- Come on.
- Stand up!

1512
01:58:17,049 --> 01:58:18,505
Move!

1513
01:58:20,552 --> 01:58:22,964
- Let's go.
- Move!

1514
01:58:23,096 --> 01:58:28,808
- You're the one I want.
- You're finished, pal.

1515
01:58:28,935 --> 01:58:31,518
Handcuff him.

1516
01:58:48,455 --> 01:58:52,790
- Wait! Where are you going?
- I got something to clear up.

1517
01:59:24,032 --> 01:59:25,693
OK, lovebirds.

1518
01:59:25,826 --> 01:59:28,488
Come on, Li’s Z,
let's go settle our scores.

1519
01:59:28,620 --> 01:59:30,031
Come on.

1520
01:59:30,163 --> 01:59:33,497
Not you.
You're a present for the media.

1521
02:00:10,412 --> 02:00:15,407
- Does it come to 10,000?
- Almost. That's all I have.

1522
02:00:15,542 --> 02:00:18,751
- That's all there was, chief.
- We searched everywhere.

1523
02:00:18,879 --> 02:00:20,870
Let him go.

1524
02:00:23,717 --> 02:00:28,883
What about this ring?
Is it gold?

1525
02:00:29,014 --> 02:00:33,633
Fill it up.
You'll owe us the rest.

1526
02:00:33,769 --> 02:00:35,601
Let's go.

1527
02:00:38,648 --> 02:00:41,106
Fucking war!

1528
02:00:43,111 --> 02:00:45,648
Knockout Ned is dead
and I'm dead broke!

1529
02:00:45,781 --> 02:00:48,148
You're fucked, eh?

1530
02:00:48,283 --> 02:00:53,699
Kids, we'll have to do a few hold-ups
to get my business going again.

1531
02:00:53,830 --> 02:00:57,289
- Your business, Li’s Z?
- What's your problem, kid?

1532
02:00:57,417 --> 02:01:00,000
This is for our friend, motherfucker!

1533
02:01:00,128 --> 02:01:01,618
A Soviet attack!

1534
02:01:01,755 --> 02:01:03,746
(Hail of gunfire)

1535
02:01:08,637 --> 02:01:10,878
<i>The business is ours!</i>

1536
02:02:05,485 --> 02:02:09,979
<i>This picture of the hood
will guarantee my salary.</i>

1537
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:13,941
<i>This one will make me famous.</i>

1538
02:02:14,077 --> 02:02:15,818
<i>It'll even make the cover
of a magazine.</i>

1539
02:02:19,249 --> 02:02:21,160
<i>I won't have to worry
about Li'! Z any more.</i>

1540
02:02:24,754 --> 02:02:26,745
<i>But the cops?</i>

1541
02:02:35,015 --> 02:02:40,055
GANGSTER, SELF-STYLED BOSS
OF CITY OF GOD, SHOT DEAD

1542
02:02:41,521 --> 02:02:43,558
Where are the other photos?

1543
02:02:43,690 --> 02:02:46,352
Only this photo
could've gotten us killed?

1544
02:02:46,484 --> 02:02:48,066
I think so.

1545
02:02:48,194 --> 02:02:52,734
- At least it got you a job.
- Not a job, an internship.

1546
02:02:52,866 --> 02:02:57,861
- It pays a little, doesn't it?
- A little.

1547
02:02:57,996 --> 02:03:00,909
What about that lady journalist?
Was she a good lay?

1548
02:03:01,041 --> 02:03:03,624
- More or less.
- You didn't like it?

1549
02:03:03,752 --> 02:03:07,086
I don't think journalists
know how to screw.

1550
02:03:07,213 --> 02:03:11,753
- Cocoa robbed three houses in Barr.
- Better kill him.

1551
02:03:11,885 --> 02:03:14,297
- Who shot Roger?
- It was Beef.

1552
02:03:14,429 --> 02:03:16,261
Kill that fucker.

1553
02:03:16,389 --> 02:03:18,801
We should kill the chief
and Gringo as well.

1554
02:03:18,934 --> 02:03:22,427
- What about Cherry?
- Let's go. Us two, and three others.

1555
02:03:22,562 --> 02:03:24,394
It's a deal.

1556
02:03:24,522 --> 02:03:27,480
Have you heard of the Red Brigade?

1557
02:03:27,609 --> 02:03:30,317
No, but if they come,
we'll kill them.

1558
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:35,363
- Who knows how to write?
- Me, sort of.

1559
02:03:35,492 --> 02:03:38,575
Let's make a blacklist.
We'll kill them all.

1560
02:03:38,703 --> 02:03:42,037
- Put fucking Night owl on there.
- And Croquet.

1561
02:03:42,165 --> 02:03:44,281
Leonard, too.
He owes me money.

1562
02:03:44,417 --> 02:03:46,454
And China man.
He thinks he's hot stuff.

1563
02:03:46,586 --> 02:03:47,997
And Claudio.

1564
02:03:48,129 --> 02:03:51,542
- Where's Giant?
- Come on, Giant!

1565
02:04:06,731 --> 02:04:10,725
<i>I forgot to say,
my name isn't Rocket any more.</i>

1566
02:04:10,860 --> 02:04:14,854
<i>I'm now Wilson Rodriguez,
photographer.</i>

1567
02:04:35,969 --> 02:04:37,960
<i>Manuel Mach ado, aka Knockout Ned,</i>

1568
02:04:38,096 --> 02:04:41,134
