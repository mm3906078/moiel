1
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:36,009
How you doing, Keaton?

2
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,347
I can't feel my legs

3
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:45,310
Keyser.

4
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,815
Ready?

5
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:04,120
What time is it?

6
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,372
12:30.

7
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:14,857
<i>It all started back in New York
six weeks ago.</i>

8
00:05:14,983 --> 00:05:18,736
<i>A truck loaded with stripped gun parts
got jacked outside of Queens.</i>

9
00:05:18,778 --> 00:05:21,072
<i>The driver didn't see anybody,
but somebody fucked up.</i>

10
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:23,783
<i>He heard a voice.
Sometimes that's all you need.</i>

11
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:29,789
- Mr. McManus?
- Christ!

12
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:31,874
Don't you fucking guys ever sleep?

13
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:35,169
- We have a warrant for your arrest.
- Fuck you, pig.

14
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:44,429
Todd Hockney?

15
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:47,974
- Who wants to know?
- New York Police Department.

16
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,439
- Shit.
- Freeze!

17
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,815
Hold it!

18
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,613
Sure you brought enough guys?

19
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,525
It's quite simple, really.

20
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:44,489
A restaurant that changes with the taste
without losing the overall aesthetic.

21
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,823
In other words,

22
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:48,993
the atmosphere will not be
painted on the walls.

23
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:54,457
- Well, let me give you an example.
- This I had to see for myself.

24
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:58,169
David.

25
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:01,631
- I'm in a meeting.
- Time for another one.

26
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,009
Everyone, this is David Kujan.

27
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:07,512
Special Agent Kujan, US Customs.

28
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:10,681
These gentlemen are
from the New York Police Department.

29
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:14,685
You look good, Keaton.
Better than I would have thought.

30
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:19,690
A small matter of a stolen truck
loaded with guns.

31
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,694
Mr. Keaton?

32
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:26,697
Will you excuse us for a moment?

33
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:30,535
We have some questions
to ask you downtown.

34
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:31,869
You're gonna be a while.

35
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:35,832
No, no, no. Please, please, please.
Sit down.

36
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:38,876
This is... This is a small problem.

37
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,588
Enjoy the meal. I'll talk to you later.

38
00:08:05,236 --> 00:08:07,572
<i>It didn't make
sense that I'd be there.</i>

39
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:10,533
<i>I mean, these guys were
hard-core hijackers,</i>

40
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:12,368
<i>but there I was.</i>

41
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:16,914
<i>At that point, I wasn't scared.</i>

42
00:08:16,956 --> 00:08:19,917
<i>I knew I hadn't done anything
they could do me for.</i>

43
00:08:20,877 --> 00:08:22,628
<i>Besides, it was fun.</i>

44
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:25,590
<i>I got to make like I was notorious.</i>

45
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,134
<i>All right,
you all know the drill.</i>

46
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,385
<i>When your number is called,</i>

47
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:32,597
<i>step forward and repeat the phrase
you've been given. Understand?</i>

48
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:35,266
<i>Number one, step forward.</i>

49
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,607
"Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker."

50
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,611
<i>Number two, step forward.</i>

51
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:53,117
Give me the fucking keys,
you fucking cocksucker, motherfucker!

52
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:56,495
Knock it off! Get back!
Number three, step forward.

53
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,467
<i>- "Hand me the keys, you cocksucker."
In English, please.</i>

54
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:12,345
<i>- Excuse me'?
- In English.</i>

55
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:16,265
Hand me the fucking keys, you cocksucker.
What the fuck?

56
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:18,267
<i>Number four, step forward.</i>

57
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:21,312
<i>It was bullshit.
The whole rap was a setup.</i>

58
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:24,357
"Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker."

59
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,400
<i>It was the cops' fault.</i>

60
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:28,361
<i>You don't put guys like that
into a room together.</i>

61
00:09:28,444 --> 00:09:29,695
<i>Number five, step forward.</i>

62
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:31,864
<i>Who knows what can happen?</i>

63
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:35,284
"Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker."

64
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:39,455
This has really got to be
embarrassing for you guys, huh?

65
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:40,831
<i>They drilled us all night.</i>

66
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:42,833
<i>Somebody was pissed
about that truck getting hijacked</i>

67
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,168
<i>and the cops had nothing.</i>

68
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,836
<i>They were hoping
somebody would slip up</i>

69
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:47,505
<i>and give them something to go on.</i>

70
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:50,341
<i>They knew we wouldn't fight it
because they knew how to lean on us.</i>

71
00:09:50,383 --> 00:09:51,676
<i>They've been doing it forever.</i>

72
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,469
<i>I mean, our rights
went right out the window.</i>

73
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:55,596
<i>It was a violation. I mean, disgraceful.</i>

74
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,599
<i>They went after McManus first.
Top-notch entry man.</i>

75
00:09:58,683 --> 00:10:00,059
What truck?

76
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,311
The truck with the guns, fucko.

77
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:03,562
"Fucko?"

78
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:09,026
<i>He was a good guy.
Crazy, though.</i>

79
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,195
You wanna know
what your buddy Fenster told us?

80
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,114
- Say who?
- McManus.

81
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:14,907
He told us another story altogether.

82
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:18,619
Oh, is that the one
about the hooker with dysentery?

83
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:21,872
<i>Fenster always worked
with McManus. He was a real tight-ass,</i>

84
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:25,209
<i>but when it came to the job,
he was right on. A smart man.</i>

85
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:28,004
- What are you saying?
- I said he'll flip you.

86
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:31,048
- He'll what?
- Flip you. Flip you for real.

87
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,467
- Yeah, I'm shaking. Come on.
- Okay.

88
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:36,554
- Answer my question.
- Can you hear me in the back?

89
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:38,723
Hello?

90
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:40,891
I want my lawyer.

91
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,686
I'm gonna have your
fucking badge, cocksucker.

92
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:46,564
<i>Todd Hockney,
good with explosives.</i>

93
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:50,735
<i>Without a doubt, the one guy
who didn't give a fuck about anybody.</i>

94
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,404
You guys don't have
a fucking leg to stand on.

95
00:10:53,446 --> 00:10:54,739
You think so, tough guy?

96
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,199
I can put you in Queens
on the night of the hijacking.

97
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,451
Really?

98
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:00,328
I live in Queens.

99
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:02,788
Did you put that together
yourself, Einstein?

100
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:05,458
What, you got a team of monkeys
working around the clock on this?

101
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,878
You know what happens
if you do another turn in the joint?

102
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,923
Fuck your father in the shower
and then have a snack.

103
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:16,344
- Are you gonna charge me, dickhead?
<i>- I'll</i> charge you when I'm ready.

104
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:17,511
With what?

105
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:19,096
You know damn well, dead man.

106
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:20,222
<i>But Keaton?</i>

107
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:23,100
<i>Keaton was the real prize for them,
for obvious reasons.</i>

108
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:25,853
It was your mistake, not mine.

109
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,608
Did you ever stop to ask me?

110
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:36,238
I mean, I've been walking around
with the same face, the same name.

111
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,075
I'm a businessman.

112
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,285
Yeah, what's that?
The restaurant business?

113
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:45,289
No. From now on, you're in
the getting-fucked-by-us business.

114
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:47,792
I'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker.

115
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,251
Like I said,

116
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:51,837
it was your mistake,

117
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,464
not mine.

118
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:56,175
Now, you charge me with this shit

119
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:58,969
and I'll beat it.

120
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,305
Okay?

121
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:04,475
Let's get back to the truck, asshole.

122
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:07,520
All right, really, really, really,

123
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:09,063
somebody gotta do
something about this shit,

124
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,148
getting hauled in every five minutes.

125
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:12,983
So I did a little time.

126
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:17,488
Does that mean I get railed every time
a truck finds its way off the planet?

127
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,823
Fuck 'em.

128
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:21,117
Fenster, will you relax?

129
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:23,536
These guys don't have
any probable cause.

130
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,704
You're fucking-A right. No PC.

131
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:29,250
Not goddamn right.
You do some time, never let you go.

132
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,836
You know, they treat me like a criminal,

133
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,839
- I'll end up a criminal.
- You are a criminal.

134
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:38,884
Now, Why'd you got to go and do that?

135
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:42,596
- Trying to make a point.
- Well, why don't you make your point?

136
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,057
You're making me tired all over.

137
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:46,600
Oh, fuck it, then.

138
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,353
- I heard you were dead.
- Oh, yeah?

139
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:50,521
Well, you heard right.

140
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,690
Word I got is you
hung up your spurs, man.

141
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,568
- What's that all about?
- What's this?

142
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,698
Rumor has it Keaton's gone straight.
I hear he's tapping Edie Finneran.

143
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:01,949
Who is that?

144
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,577
She's a heavyweight criminal lawyer
from uptown.

145
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,704
I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.

146
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,581
How about it, Keaton?

147
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,499
You a lawyer's wife?

148
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,544
What kind of retainer you giving her?

149
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:14,587
Whoops!

150
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:18,132
Hey, Fenster, do your friend a favor.

151
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,218
Tell him to keep quiet.

152
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:23,762
Dean Keaton.

153
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:26,765
Gone clean, huh?

154
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:28,893
Say it ain't so.

155
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:32,688
- Or was it you that hit that truck?
- Mac, Mac, forget him.

156
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,982
Did you get to talk to your lawyer?

157
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,860
This whole thing was a shakedown.

158
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:41,405
- What makes you say that?
- How many times you been in a lineup?

159
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:44,742
It's always you and four dummies.

160
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:48,287
The PD are paying homeless guys
10 bucks a head, half the time.

161
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,998
And there's no way
they'd line five felons in the same row.

162
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,626
No way. And what's a voice lineup?

163
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,503
A public defender
could get you out of that one.

164
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:59,089
- So, why the hell was I strip-searched?
- It was the feds.

165
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,634
A truckload of guns gets snagged,

166
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:04,303
Customs comes down on top of NYPD
looking for answers.

167
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:06,931
They come up with us.
They're clutching at straws.

168
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:08,933
I had a guy's finger up my asshole tonight.

169
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,809
Is it Friday already?

170
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:13,771
Yeah, lover boy.

171
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,690
You want a piece? Jump in. I'll love you.

172
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:19,944
So who in the goddamn piss hell
stole that fucking truck?

173
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:24,698
- What did you say?
- Who stole the fucking truck?

174
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:27,910
- I don't want to know.
- Who asked you, working man?

175
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:30,704
Fuck who did it.
What I want to know is, who's the gimp?

176
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:33,040
- He's okay.
- Says you. How do I know that?

177
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:35,084
What about it, pretzel man?
What's your story?

178
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,919
His name is Verbal.

179
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:38,629
Verbal Kint.

180
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,214
- Verbal?
- Yeah.

181
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:43,425
Roger, really. People say I talk too much.

182
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,636
Yeah, I was just going
to tell you to shut up.

183
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:49,348
- We met before, once or twice.
- In County. I was in for fraud.

184
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,725
You were in a lineup then, too.
What happened?

185
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:54,645
I walked. 90 days, suspended.

186
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:57,481
- So you did it.
- All right, now, look,

187
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,986
we've all been put out
by this whole thing, right?

188
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:05,823
So, I figure we owe it to ourselves
to salvage a little dignity.

189
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:09,660
Now, me and Fenster
heard about a little job.

190
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:11,495
Why don't you just calm down?

191
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,831
What do you care what he has to say?

192
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,792
I'm just talking here

193
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:20,379
and it seems to me like Mr. Hockney
wants to hear what I got to say

194
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:22,464
and I know Fenster's down.

195
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:24,967
What about you, guy?

196
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,178
I'm interested, sure.

197
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,389
There. See?

198
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:33,726
So now, I'd like to exercise my right
to free assembly.

199
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,603
Why don't you just shut up?

200
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,861
You're missing the point.

201
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:44,987
No.

202
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,032
You're missing the point.

203
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,701
I don't want to hear anything from you.

204
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:53,245
I don't care about your job.

205
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,206
And

206
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,919
I want nothing to do with any of you.

207
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:04,548
I beg your pardon,
but you can all go to hell.

208
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:10,596
Dean Keaton gone the high road.

209
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,475
What is the world coming to?

210
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,731
Fuck him.

211
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:27,112
<i>And that was how it started.</i>

212
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:29,573
<i>The five of us being brought in
on a trumped-up charge</i>

213
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:31,617
<i>to be leaned on by half-wits.</i>

214
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:37,414
Okay, now, I really can't
talk about it much here.

215
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:41,085
<i>What the cops never figured out,
and what I know now,</i>

216
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:44,421
<i>was that these men would never break,
never lie down,</i>

217
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:47,424
<i>never bend over for anybody.</i>

218
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:49,635
<i>Anybody-</i>

219
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:08,779
- Who are you?
- Agent Jack Baer, FBI.

220
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:11,115
- How many dead?
- Fifteen, so far.

221
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:14,076
They're still pulling some bodies
out of the water, though.

222
00:17:14,118 --> 00:17:16,120
- Any survivors?
- Yeah, there's two.

223
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,956
One guy's in County hospital,
but he's in a coma.

224
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,126
The DA has a second guy,
a cripple from New York, I think.

225
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:24,628
Listen, the chief wants this place
sealed off.

226
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,506
If you have any questions, give him a call.

227
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,125
<i>This is Dave Kujan.</i>

228
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:05,085
<i>I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.</i>

229
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:07,337
<i>If you need to reach me, contact Jeff Rabin</i>

230
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:10,716
<i>of the San Pedro Police Department
at extension 112.</i>

231
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:12,634
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

232
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,557
- Why can't I see him?
- Dave, I told you,

233
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,518
the DA came down here last night
ready to arraign,

234
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,854
even before they moved him
to County, okay?

235
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:26,106
Kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later,

236
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,359
the DA comes out of the office looking
like the bogeyman smacked him around.

237
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:32,905
All right? They take a statement
and they cut him a deal.

238
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:37,034
- Did they charge him with anything?
- Yeah, weapons. Misdemeanor 2.

239
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:38,869
What is that?

240
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:43,040
Listen, I give the DA credit
for getting that much, you understand?

241
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,625
Excuse me, sir.

242
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:48,086
This whole thing has turned political.

243
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,798
The mayor was here last night, the chief.

244
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:53,217
This morning, the governor called, okay?

245
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:55,177
I'm telling you, this guy is protected

246
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:57,471
from up on high
by the Prince of Darkness.

247
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,973
- Take my word for it.
- Well, when does he post bail?

248
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:02,267
- Maybe two hours, tops.
- I want to see him.

249
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:04,228
- No, Dave.
- Well, I gotta see him, Jeffrey.

250
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:06,897
- Dave, no! I cannot...
- Listen, you gotta do this for me.

251
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,440
I came a long way for this.

252
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,401
Dave, please.

253
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:18,617
Even if I let you talk to him,
he won't talk to you.

254
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:20,911
He's paranoid about being recorded.

255
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,835
He knows the interrogation rooms
are all wired.

256
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:23,914
<i>I</i> quit.

257
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,917
This won't be an interrogation,
just a friendly chat to kill some time.

258
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,002
He will not go into the interrogation room.

259
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:31,547
- Then someplace else, then.
- Where?

260
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

261
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,844
If this was a dope deal, where's the dope?

262
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:38,512
If it was a hit, who called it in?

263
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,764
And I'm sure you have
a host of wild theories

264
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:42,099
to answer all these questions.

265
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,461
They know damn well what I think.

266
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,519
That's crazy, and, besides,
it doesn't even matter.

267
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:48,605
The guy's got total immunity.
His story checks out.

268
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,649
He doesn't know what you want to know.

269
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:53,068
I don't think he does, not exactly.

270
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,487
But there's a lot more to his story,
believe me.

271
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:59,992
Jeffrey, look, I wanna know why
27 men died on that pier

272
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:04,371
for what looks to be $91 million
worth of dope that wasn't there.

273
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:08,041
And above all,
I want to be sure Dean Keaton's dead.

274
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:09,793
He's dead.

275
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,255
Come on. Two hours.
Just till he makes bail.

276
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,215
They're all dead.

277
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,426
I don't care how tough a guy
you say this Keaton was,

278
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:20,387
nobody on that boat
could've come out alive.

279
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,725
Is he talking?

280
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:26,643
He regained consciousness
less than an hour ago.

281
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,979
He spoke... not English, then he lapsed.

282
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,147
You think Hungarian?

283
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,982
I don't know.
I think that might've been what it was.

284
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:33,275
Yeah. Most of them were Hungarians.

285
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:34,651
Here, you gotta put on one of these.

286
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,576
Burn victims are very susceptible
to infection.

287
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:40,449
And, of course, there's no smoking.

288
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,753
Keep your mask up.
Please don't touch him.

289
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,004
Is he gonna die?

290
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:56,965
He has burns over 60% of his body,
a number of his ribs were broken...

291
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:59,676
Call hospital security, get a man
put on the door till the police get here.

292
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,887
- Is he dangerous?
- Yes.

293
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,055
Do it.

294
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:05,015
Do it, now!

295
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,604
Joel? Yeah, Baer. Down at LA County.

296
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:14,691
Look, the guy they pulled
out of the harbor is Arkosh Kovash.

297
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,526
Yes. Yes, I'm sure.

298
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:18,737
Well, no, no, he's all fucked up.

299
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:22,199
I can't hear you.

300
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:24,910
Will you shut up? I'm on the phone.

301
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:26,828
Yes.

302
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:29,373
Well, no, no. Not till I put a man on him.

303
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:32,000
Listen, send me someone
who can speak Hungarian.

304
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:34,795
Yeah, he's awake.
He's talking like a Thai hooker.

305
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,213
Keyser Soze.

306
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:39,758
- What?
- Keyser Soze!

307
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,760
Keyser Soze!

308
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:44,388
Keyser Soze.

309
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,889
No shit?

310
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:50,435
Joel, come in. Yeah.
Call Dan Metzheiser over at Justice,

311
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,896
and find Dave Kujan from Customs.

312
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:29,725
Verbal, this is Agent Kujan from Customs.

313
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,394
Nice to meet you.

314
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:35,063
He wants to ask you a few questions
before you go.

315
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:38,108
- What about?
- About a Dean Keaton, mostly.

316
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:42,279
But I'd like to start at the lineup
back in New York.

317
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:45,782
- Can I get some coffee?
- In a while. Let's talk about the lineup.

318
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:49,161
I'm really thirsty.
I used to dehydrate as a kid.

319
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:51,621
One time, I got so bad
my piss come out like snot.

320
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:53,081
I'm not kidding.
It was all thick and gooey...

321
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:54,708
I'll get your fucking coffee.

322
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,335
Get me one, too, while you're at it.

323
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:03,467
That guy is tense.

324
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:05,343
Tension is a killer.

325
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:08,430
I used to be in a barbershop quartet
in Skokie, Illinois.

326
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:11,183
The baritone was this guy
named Kip Diskin, big fat guy.

327
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,601
I mean, like, orca fat.

328
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:14,144
He was so stressed in the morning,
you know.

329
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:15,937
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.

330
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:18,190
Sure, and I appreciate that.

331
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:21,401
And I wanna help you, Agent Kujan.
I like cops.

332
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:24,071
I would've liked to have been
a fed myself, but my CP always...

333
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:28,116
Verbal, you're not telling us everything.
I know you know something.

334
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,327
<i>I told the DA
everything I know.</i>

335
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:35,123
<i>Verbal, I know you like Keaton.</i>

336
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:38,835
<i>- I know you think he's a good man.
- I know he was good.</i>

337
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:40,337
<i>He was a corrupt cop.</i>

338
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,340
<i>Sure, 15 years ago,
but he was a good thief.</i>

339
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:45,842
Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him
go legit.

340
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:48,053
Dean Keaton was a piece of shit.

341
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:53,850
Are you trying to get a rise out of me,
Agent Kujan?

342
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:57,771
- I just wanna hear your story.
- It's all there.

343
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,440
May I have a cigarette?

344
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:06,530
- According to your statement...
- I need a light.

345
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:12,869
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator,

346
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:14,704
run-of-the-mill...

347
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:22,462
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator,

348
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,923
run-of-the-mill scams.

349
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:27,592
That's been suppressed.
Anything in there is inadmissible.

350
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:31,096
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have here.
Total immunity.

351
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:34,975
Well, I do have the weapons charge.

352
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:37,686
I'm looking at
six whole months' hard time.

353
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:40,313
You know a dealer
named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?

354
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:43,483
You know a religious guy
named John Paul?

355
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:46,528
- You know Ruby's in Attica?
- He didn't have my lawyer.

356
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,488
I know Ruby. He's big on respect.

357
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:51,074
He's a good friend of mine,
likes me very much.

358
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:54,077
Now, I know your testimony is sealed.
Ruby's well-connected.

359
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:56,872
He's got lots of friends inside,
do a lot of favors for him.

360
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,373
What do you think he would say

361
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:00,750
if he found out
you dropped his name to the DA?

362
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:04,588
- There's nothing in there about Ruby.
- I'll be sure to mention that to him.

363
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,381
First thing on the job,
you know what I learned?

364
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:07,716
How to spot a murderer.

365
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:10,135
Let's say you arrest three guys
for the same killing.

366
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:11,678
You put them all in jail overnight.

367
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:13,763
The next morning,
whoever's sleeping is your man.

368
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:15,557
You see, if you're guilty,
you know you're caught.

369
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:17,809
You get some rest.
You let your guard down.

370
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:19,769
- You follow me?
- No.

371
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:22,647
Let me get right to the point.

372
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,567
I'm smarter than you

373
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:27,819
and I'm gonna find out what I wanna know

374
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:31,323
and I'm gonna get it from you,
whether you like it or not.

375
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:32,908
I'm not a rat.

376
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:40,457
Thanks.

377
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:46,922
Back when I was picking beans
in Guatemala,

378
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,590
we used to make fresh coffee.

379
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:51,468
Right off the trees, I mean. That was good.

380
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:54,137
This is shit,
but, hey, I'm in a police station.

381
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:55,639
Can we get started again?

382
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:57,974
Now, what happened after the lineup?

383
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:05,774
The desk sergeant
was actually trying to tell me

384
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:06,983
that he couldn't release you.

385
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:10,070
I mean, can you believe that?
You weren't even charged.

386
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:11,529
Damn police.

387
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:16,576
You know, I wanna have
pictures taken of your face.

388
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,787
I'll take them to the DA's office
first thing in the morning.

389
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,455
- Forget about it.
- Absolutely not!

390
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:22,897
I'm gonna have this thing
in front of a grand jury by Monday.

391
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:25,669
Look, I don't want
to talk about it, Edie, okay?

392
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:30,173
So, what did Fortier and Renault say?

393
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:32,676
They asked for some more time
to think about investing.

394
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,302
- Damn it.
- More time. It's okay.

395
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:35,971
More time for what, Edie?

396
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:39,933
No matter how you cover my tracks,
they're still gonna find out about me.

397
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:41,685
Give me some credit.

398
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:44,187
I got you this far.
Let's go to the grand jury.

399
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:45,897
You know, this isn't gonna stop
if we don't...

400
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:48,400
It's never going to stop, period.

401
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:52,654
By next week, every investor in the city
is gonna be walking away from us.

402
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:56,199
It's finished.

403
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:57,909
I'm finished.

404
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,792
Don't give up on me now, Dean.

405
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:09,713
It's never gonna stop.

406
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:18,388
I love you.

407
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:21,808
They ruined me in there tonight.

408
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:25,145
I love you.

409
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,064
Do you hear me?

410
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,197
What?

411
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:40,118
All right.

412
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:43,246
Let's just go to my place.

413
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:00,430
We'll worry about this tomorrow.

414
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:06,227
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

415
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:11,399
<i>Fenster and McManus
had</i> a <i>cagey proposition,</i>

416
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:14,069
<i>a fast-jump, high-risk, long money.</i>

417
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:16,279
<i>We all knew it could be done.</i>

418
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:19,240
<i>The way I figured,
to do it wrong meant killing.</i>

419
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:21,493
<i>To do it right took five men.</i>

420
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:23,745
<i>Five men meant Keaton.</i>

421
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:26,790
<i>Keaton took convincing.</i>

422
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:31,669
New York's finest taxi service.

423
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:33,713
Bullshit.

424
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:35,799
Bullshit.

425
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:39,135
They don't operate anymore.

426
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:41,262
McManus has a friend in the 14th precinct.

427
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:43,390
They're coming out for one job, Thursday.

428
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:46,226
They're picking up a guy smuggling
emeralds out of South America.

429
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:48,311
McManus already has a fence
set to take the stuff.

430
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:49,562
A fence? Who?

431
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:51,272
Some guy in California,
his name is Redfoot.

432
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:54,317
- I never heard of him.
- You have to come.

433
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:58,655
- What's it to you whether I do it or not?
- They don't know me. You do.

434
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:01,491
They won't take me unless you go.

435
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:03,868
Look at me. I need this.

436
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:08,164
You're telling me you don't need this?
Is this your place?

437
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:09,332
Look, I'm not knocking you.

438
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:12,210
You look like you got a good little scam
going with this lawyer.

439
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:17,715
Sorry.

440
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:20,468
It's okay. It's okay.

441
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:24,722
You say it's the real thing? That's cool.

442
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:28,476
You Okay?

443
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,395
I was out of line.

444
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:34,065
But they're never gonna stop with us,
you know that.

445
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:36,860
As clean as you could ever get,
they'll never let you go now.

446
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:41,281
This way, we hit the cops where it hurts
and we get well in the meantime.

447
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:46,703
You're sure you're okay?

448
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:48,621
I'll be all right.

449
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:04,387
Look, i...

450
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:07,515
- I sometimes get...
- Forget it.

451
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:13,229
I'll probably shit blood tonight.

452
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:25,533
So...

453
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:30,288
How do they wanna do it?

454
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:34,417
McManus wants to go in shooting,
I say no.

455
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:37,670
Fenster? Hockney?

456
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:41,382
They're pretty pissed off.
They'll do anything.

457
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:43,593
Now, I got a way to do it
without killing anyone.

458
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:46,804
But like I say,
they won't let me in without you.

459
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,574
Three million?

460
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:09,786
Maybe more.

461
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:15,792
No killing.

462
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,379
Not if we do it my way.

463
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:56,499
<i>New York's finest taxi service
was not your normal taxi service.</i>

464
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:59,002
<i>It was a ring of corrupt cops in the NYPD</i>

465
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:00,545
<i>that ran a high-profit racket,</i>

466
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:03,047
<i>driving smugglers and drug dealers
all over the city.</i>

467
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:04,549
<i>For a few hundred dollars a mile,</i>

468
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:06,968
<i>you got your own blue and white,
and a police escort.</i>

469
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,970
<i>They even had their own business cards.</i>

470
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:11,472
<i>After a while,
somebody started asking questions</i>

471
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:13,182
<i>and the taxi service shut down.</i>

472
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:14,350
<i>Ever since then,</i>

473
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:16,936
<i>Internal Affairs have been waiting
to catch them in the act.</i>

474
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,855
<i>And that's where we came in.</i>

475
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:21,608
- So, how was the flight?
- Fucking great.

476
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:26,404
Will this get me to Staten Island?

477
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:29,991
You kidding me?
This'll get you to Cape Cod.

478
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:32,869
<i>McManus came to us
with the job, Fenster got the vans,</i>

479
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:34,579
<i>Hockney supplied the hardware,</i>

480
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:37,332
<i>I came through with how to do it
so no one got killed.</i>

481
00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:40,543
<i>But Keaton?
Keaton put on the finishing touch.</i>

482
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:44,714
<i>A little fuck you
from the five of us to the NYPD.</i>

483
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,719
All right, watch this, watch this.
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

484
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:51,638
Careful, careful, careful!

485
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:53,014
Come on, asshole!

486
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:56,100
Holy shit!

487
00:32:57,101 --> 00:33:00,229
- Don't move, you fucker!
- Drop it now, motherfucker!

488
00:33:00,313 --> 00:33:02,398
Drop the fucking gun! Drop it!

489
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,734
Don't fucking move.
Don't fucking touch a fucking thing.

490
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:07,236
- What the fuck do you guys want?
- Put your fucking thing away.

491
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:09,405
We're cops, you stupid assholes!

492
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:12,075
- Watch the glass!
- Don't fucking move, motherfucker!

493
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:14,369
<i>You want a buckshot shampoo,
chubby?</i>

494
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,703
Shut up!

495
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:18,665
Oh, fuck!

496
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,420
Afternoon, my little pork chops.
Now give me the shit.

497
00:33:24,462 --> 00:33:26,130
- Don't move!
- Give him the fucking shit!

498
00:33:26,214 --> 00:33:28,216
Give him the fucking thing!
Give him the fucking thing!

499
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:30,093
Give him the fucking shit, man!

500
00:33:30,134 --> 00:33:32,679
- Give it to me.
- Hurry up! Come on!

501
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:34,597
- Now the money.
- There's no money.

502
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:36,099
Give me the money right now,
motherfucker!

503
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,141
There's no fucking money.

504
00:33:37,225 --> 00:33:39,585
- Give him the money right now!
- Give me the fucking money!

505
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:42,177
- Do it! Give him the money!
- Give me the fucking money!

506
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:44,440
- Give him the money!
- Hurry up!

507
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:47,944
You know the fucking...
You know who the fuck I am?

508
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:50,697
You people know who the fuck I am? Fuck!

509
00:33:51,322 --> 00:33:53,116
We do now, jerk-off.

510
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:55,410
Cocksucker.

511
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:02,875
Wait a minute. What's that?
Oh, shit.

512
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,003
What the fuck was...

513
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:07,505
Holy shit!

514
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:11,968
Go, go, go!

515
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:26,149
<i>Keaton made
an anonymous phone call.</i>

516
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,776
<i>The press was on the scene
before the police were.</i>

517
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:31,320
<i>Strausz and Rizzi
were indicted three days later.</i>

518
00:34:31,362 --> 00:34:34,490
<i>Within</i> a <i>few weeks,
50 more cops went down with them.</i>

519
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:38,202
<i>Everybody got it right in the ass,
from the chief on down.</i>

520
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:39,912
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

521
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:49,672
I owe you $2.50.

522
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:52,425
Dr. Keaton.

523
00:34:55,178 --> 00:34:59,098
- There's more here than I thought.
- When's the fence coming?

524
00:34:59,182 --> 00:35:02,643
Redfoot never comes to see me,
I always go to see him.

525
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:04,771
In California?

526
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:08,524
Yes, Verbal, in California.
Fenster and I...

527
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:10,526
Wait, wait, wait. Hold the fucking phone.

528
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:12,945
You and Fenster? No, no, no, no.

529
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:16,866
- You fucking kidding me?
- Okay, so, then who's gonna go?

530
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:19,118
We all go!

531
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:23,289
What's your fucking problem, man?

532
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:24,707
My fucking problem, man,

533
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:27,001
is that you and Fenster
are off honeymooning in California,

534
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:29,045
while the rest of us are sitting here
holding our dicks.

535
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:31,047
Hey! The job's over.

536
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:33,382
Cool it.

537
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,094
LA's a good place to lie low for a while.

538
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:41,390
You wanna dance?

539
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:49,732
Ladies.

540
00:35:57,698 --> 00:36:00,034
I would like to propose a toast.

541
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,411
There you go.

542
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:06,624
To Mr. Verbal,

543
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,211
the man with the plan.

544
00:36:23,474 --> 00:36:25,142
We're gonna miss the flight.

545
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:28,938
Don't do this. Send her a note, something.

546
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:31,816
I said we'll make it.

547
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,810
We're gonna miss the plane.

548
00:37:09,103 --> 00:37:10,771
She'll understand.

549
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,710
That's heartwarming. Really.

550
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:36,130
I'm weepy!

551
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:39,508
Jeff, you wanna wait outside?

552
00:37:42,637 --> 00:37:44,798
You guys wanted to know
what happened after the lineup,

553
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:47,350
- I'm telling you.
- Come on, Verbal.

554
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:49,560
Who do you think you're talking to?

555
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:52,396
You expect me to believe that he retired?

556
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:54,690
For a woman?

557
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:59,362
Bullshit. Keaton was using her.

558
00:37:59,904 --> 00:38:02,031
- He loved her.
- Sure.

559
00:38:02,073 --> 00:38:03,491
<i>And I'm supposed to believe</i>

560
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:05,612
<i>that hitting the taxi service
wasn't his idea either.</i>

561
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:07,161
<i>It was all Fenster and McManus.</i>

562
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:09,372
<i>Come on, Keaton was a cop for four years.</i>

563
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:11,248
<i>Who else would know
the taxi service better?</i>

564
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:13,000
<i>That job had his name
written all over on it.</i>

565
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:14,442
<i>But Edie had him all turned around.</i>

566
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:16,379
Let me tell you something,

567
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:18,130
I know Dean Keaton.

568
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:21,008
I've been investigating him
for the past three years.

569
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:23,886
The guy I know
was a cold-blooded bastard.

570
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:26,222
LAD indicted him
on three counts of murder

571
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:28,265
before he was kicked off the force.

572
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:30,726
So, don't sell me the hooker
with a heart of gold.

573
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:32,645
You got him all wrong.

574
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:34,522
<i>Do i?></i>

575
00:38:35,106 --> 00:38:37,900
Dean Keaton was under indictment
a total of seven times

576
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:39,568
while he was on the force.

577
00:38:39,652 --> 00:38:42,238
In every case, witnesses
either reversed their testimony

578
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:45,616
to the grand jury
or died before they could testify.

579
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:51,080
When they finally did nail him for fraud,
he spent five years in Sing Sing.

580
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:53,249
He killed three prisoners inside.

581
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:56,002
Of course, I can't prove this,

582
00:38:57,253 --> 00:38:59,922
but I can't prove the best part either.

583
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:03,050
Dean Keaton was dead.

584
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:05,553
Did you know that?

585
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:07,596
He died in a fire two years ago

586
00:39:07,638 --> 00:39:10,182
during an investigation
into the murder of a witness

587
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:12,518
who was going to testify against him.

588
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:15,604
Two people saw Dean Keaton
walk into a warehouse he owned

589
00:39:15,646 --> 00:39:17,440
just before it blew up.

590
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:20,943
They said he went in
to check a leaking gas main.

591
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:24,739
It blew up
and took all of Dean Keaton with it.

592
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:30,745
Within three months of the explosion,
the two witnesses, they were dead.

593
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:33,622
One killed himself in his car.

594
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:36,500
The other fell down an open elevator shaft.

595
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:41,088
- Agent Baer?
- Let's get this show on the road.

596
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,298
- Agent Baer?
- Yeah, wait, just wait, hold on.

597
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:44,717
This is not what we discussed.
There are too many people in this room.

598
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,177
Doctor, look. I promise
we'll be out of here

599
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,303
before he blows his porch light, okay?

600
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,180
- I have a noon meeting, Baer.
- Yeah. Okay, look.

601
00:39:49,263 --> 00:39:51,891
- Agent Baer, five minutes.
- Everyone just calm down, all right?

602
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:55,311
I want you to ask this man
about the shootout in the harbor.

603
00:40:07,198 --> 00:40:10,117
- He says they were buying...
- Dope. We know.

604
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:19,001
He doesn't know what they were buying,
but not dope.

605
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,170
- People.
- What?

606
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:30,846
He needs guarantees...

607
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:34,016
- What is he talking about, guarantees?
- He says his life's in danger.

608
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:38,896
He saw the Devil, looked him in the eye.

609
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:41,941
- I'm on my way.
- No, no, no. Wait a minute.

610
00:40:42,024 --> 00:40:46,195
Ask him to tell him what he told me
about the Devil.

611
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,906
Who's the Devil?

612
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:55,663
Keyser Soze.

613
00:41:00,543 --> 00:41:02,002
Keyser Soze?

614
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:04,880
Yeah, he was in the harbor,
killing many men.

615
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:07,383
He saw Keyser Soze?

616
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:16,517
- He saw his face.
- All right. All right, look, okay?

617
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:19,395
Tell him to tell her what he looks like.

618
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:21,438
- Describe him.
- Okay.

619
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:30,239
Six weeks ago,
I get an anonymous phone call

620
00:41:30,281 --> 00:41:33,325
telling me I can find Keaton
eating at Mondino's with his attorney.

621
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:34,493
And there he is.

622
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,122
Now, because he never profited
from his alleged death,

623
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:39,790
and because we convicted someone else

624
00:41:39,874 --> 00:41:43,586
of the murder we tried to pin on him,
we had to let him go.

625
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,673
He was dead just long enough
for the murder rap to blow over,

626
00:41:47,798 --> 00:41:49,466
and then he had lunch.

627
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:51,802
I don't know about that.

628
00:41:51,886 --> 00:41:55,681
Oh, I don't think you do.
But you say you saw Keaton die.

629
00:41:56,473 --> 00:41:59,435
I think you're covering his ass,
and he's still out there somewhere.

630
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:01,812
I think he's behind that whole circus
at the harbor.

631
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:03,939
My bet is he's using you
because you're stupid

632
00:42:04,023 --> 00:42:05,441
and you think he's your friend.

633
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:07,943
You tell me he's dead, so be it.

634
00:42:08,736 --> 00:42:10,988
I wanna be sure he's dead
before I go back to New York.

635
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,991
He wasn't behind anything,
it was the lawyer.

636
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:17,620
What lawyer? What lawyer, Verbal?

637
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:20,663
You know, back when I was in that
barbershop quartet in Skokie, Illinois...

638
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:23,292
You don't think that I know
you held out on the DA?

639
00:42:23,334 --> 00:42:25,002
What did you leave out of that testimony?

640
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:27,213
I could be on the phone to Ruby Deemer
in 10 minutes.

641
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:29,965
- The DA gave me immunity.
- Not from me.

642
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,551
You get no immunity from me,
you piece of shit.

643
00:42:32,635 --> 00:42:36,138
Every criminal I have put in prison,
every cop that owes me a favor,

644
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,641
every creep and scumbag
that walks the street for a living

645
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:40,184
will know the name of Verbal Kint.

646
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:41,644
Now, you talk to me

647
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:44,146
or that precious immunity
they seem so fit to grant you

648
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:47,775
won't be worth the paper the contract
put out on your life is printed on.

649
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:52,363
There was a lawyer.

650
00:42:53,656 --> 00:42:54,990
Kobayashi.

651
00:42:56,075 --> 00:43:00,454
- Is he the one that killed Keaton?
- No. But I'm sure Keaton is dead.

652
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:02,873
Convince me.

653
00:43:03,582 --> 00:43:05,668
And tell me every last detail.

654
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:28,774
<i>We arrived in Los Angeles
and met McManus' fence, Redfoot.</i>

655
00:43:29,525 --> 00:43:32,695
<i>He had a good reputation.
Seemed like a good guy.</i>

656
00:43:33,404 --> 00:43:35,447
<i>Still, we should have known better.</i>

657
00:43:35,531 --> 00:43:36,573
How you doing?

658
00:43:36,657 --> 00:43:39,410
- Good. You?
- Not bad. Can't complain.

659
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:42,371
How's it going, Fenster?

660
00:43:43,205 --> 00:43:45,457
Don't need to open it, right?

661
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,881
You must be Keaton.

662
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:55,884
Redfoot, Dean Keaton.

663
00:43:55,968 --> 00:43:59,972
- Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint.
- Verbal, the man with the plan, huh?

664
00:44:00,764 --> 00:44:02,641
You guys interested in any more work?

665
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:06,270
- We're always looking for extra work.
- We're on vacation.

666
00:44:06,395 --> 00:44:08,731
Oh, well, that's too bad.

667
00:44:09,648 --> 00:44:12,234
I got a ton of work
and I don't have any good people.

668
00:44:12,276 --> 00:44:14,570
- Not like you guys.
- What's the job?

669
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:17,364
There's this jeweler out of Texas
named Saul.

670
00:44:17,406 --> 00:44:19,742
He rents a suite in some downtown hotel.

671
00:44:19,825 --> 00:44:21,577
He does free appraisals for people.

672
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,495
Sometimes he buys,
sometimes he doesn't.

673
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:26,832
Anyway, the word is,
he carries around a lot of cash.

674
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:30,669
So I figure, I keep the merchandise,
you keep the green.

675
00:44:31,378 --> 00:44:33,714
- Simple.
- What about security?

676
00:44:33,756 --> 00:44:37,092
Couple of bodyguards,
nothing you couldn't handle.

677
00:44:37,301 --> 00:44:41,096
- Give me time to check it out?
- I expect nothing less from you, man.

678
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:44,892
- Good to see you. We'll call you.
- Good to see you, too.

679
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:47,978
- All right.
- Enjoy LA, huh? Get yourself laid.

680
00:44:48,437 --> 00:44:49,438
Hey.

681
00:44:52,816 --> 00:44:56,820
A friend of mine in New York
tells me that you knew Spook Hollis.

682
00:44:57,863 --> 00:45:00,949
The way I hear it,
you did time with old Spook.

683
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:03,077
Good man, wasn't he?

684
00:45:03,327 --> 00:45:05,454
I used to run dope for him.

685
00:45:05,871 --> 00:45:08,165
- Too bad he got shived.
- Yeah.

686
00:45:10,209 --> 00:45:11,752
I shived him.

687
00:45:13,879 --> 00:45:17,424
Better you hear it from me now
than from somebody else later.

688
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:20,552
I appreciate that.

689
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:24,098
Just out of curiosity,

690
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:26,725
was it business or personal?

691
00:45:29,103 --> 00:45:30,604
Bit of both.

692
00:45:32,064 --> 00:45:33,732
Well, like I said,

693
00:45:34,108 --> 00:45:36,985
you give me a call
if you're interested, all right?

694
00:45:41,156 --> 00:45:42,908
Is there a problem?

695
00:45:44,618 --> 00:45:47,246
One job. That was the deal.

696
00:45:53,085 --> 00:45:54,336
One job?

697
00:45:57,506 --> 00:45:58,715
One job?

698
00:46:00,426 --> 00:46:02,511
That's a good one, Keaton.

699
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:08,350
<i>Keaton fought it as best he could,
but a man can't change what he is.</i>

700
00:46:08,434 --> 00:46:11,520
<i>He can convince anyone
he's someone else, but never himself.</i>

701
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:15,232
<i>It took one day with McManus nagging
and we went back to work.</i>

702
00:46:29,872 --> 00:46:32,583
So anyways, I get out of my car
and the thing is wrecked.

703
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:35,878
I look in the backseat of the other car
and this woman's totally naked.

704
00:46:35,961 --> 00:46:39,047
- I'm laughing so hard I can't breathe.
- Get in the car, Saul.

705
00:46:39,548 --> 00:46:42,259
Freeze, motherfucker, freeze!
Stay right there!

706
00:46:43,927 --> 00:46:46,555
There's a second one here somewhere.

707
00:46:49,558 --> 00:46:52,436
Give me the case.
Give me the fucking case!

708
00:46:59,109 --> 00:47:02,571
Give me the fucking case.
I'm telling you for the last time.

709
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:04,781
Give me the fucking case!

710
00:47:09,036 --> 00:47:11,580
- Come on!
- Hey, hey! Don't move!

711
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:49,117
Look, just hand over the case.

712
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,787
Hand over the fucking case.

713
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:17,396
Come on, let's go!

714
00:48:18,105 --> 00:48:19,773
- Come on!
- Bad day.

715
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:21,275
- Come on, let's go!
- Fuck it.

716
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:22,818
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

717
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,176
Fuck.

718
00:48:51,305 --> 00:48:55,017
Looks like a lot of
China to me. Shit.

719
00:49:00,314 --> 00:49:01,815
Guys, come on.

720
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:04,276
What are you doing?

721
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:05,819
What's it look like I'm doing?
I'm gonna kill him.

722
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:07,863
Look, we did it your way,
now we're gonna do it my way.

723
00:49:07,904 --> 00:49:09,740
- Are you gonna kill him?
- I'm gonna deal with him.

724
00:49:09,823 --> 00:49:11,867
- Yeah, you better deal with him.
- I'm gonna deal with him.

725
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:12,951
Shut up.

726
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,878
What am I supposed to do with that?

727
00:49:23,045 --> 00:49:26,214
I don't know, feed it to the gimp.
Ease his pain. I don't know what that is.

728
00:49:26,298 --> 00:49:27,899
What do you mean you don't know?
Shut up.

729
00:49:27,924 --> 00:49:30,719
I don't know.
I got thrown this job by some lawyer.

730
00:49:30,761 --> 00:49:31,928
Yeah, who?

731
00:49:32,012 --> 00:49:34,014
I don't know, some limey.

732
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:37,643
He's a middleman for somebody, okay?
He doesn't say, I don't ask.

733
00:49:37,726 --> 00:49:40,228
- You're fucking full of shit!
- Fuck you.

734
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:42,230
- Fuck you.
- Listen to me.

735
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:44,399
We wanna meet him, okay?

736
00:49:44,733 --> 00:49:46,193
That's funny.

737
00:49:46,943 --> 00:49:49,738
He called me last night,
he says he wants to meet you guys.

738
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:53,033
Okay, we'll meet him.

739
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:54,534
- I'll call you.
- Good.

740
00:49:54,576 --> 00:49:56,078
- Do that. No problem.
- I don't like it, Dean.

741
00:49:56,161 --> 00:49:59,331
I don't like it. Wait a minute.
One more thing, tough guy.

742
00:49:59,414 --> 00:50:02,250
Any more surprises,
and I'm gonna kill you.

743
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:06,630
You're such a tough guy, McManus.
But do me a favor, all right?

744
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:09,091
- Get the fuck off my dick.
- Fuck!

745
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:10,634
Don't, don't.

746
00:50:11,718 --> 00:50:13,762
Put a leash on that puppy.

747
00:50:15,681 --> 00:50:19,267
You know, it's an awful shame
about Saul getting whacked.

748
00:50:19,601 --> 00:50:22,437
Cops are gonna be
looking for the guys who did it.

749
00:50:22,854 --> 00:50:26,233
Sooner or later
they're gonna come around asking me.

750
00:50:27,943 --> 00:50:30,237
You have a sweet night, ladies.

751
00:50:33,949 --> 00:50:35,242
Fuck you.

752
00:50:41,623 --> 00:50:44,042
- So this lawyer...
- Kobayashi.

753
00:50:45,252 --> 00:50:47,295
- Came from Redfoot.
- Right.

754
00:50:47,963 --> 00:50:50,590
And why leave this out
when you talked to the DA?

755
00:50:50,632 --> 00:50:52,676
Dave, someone to see you.

756
00:50:56,221 --> 00:50:57,347
Jack.

757
00:50:58,515 --> 00:51:00,392
I've been looking all over for you.

758
00:51:00,475 --> 00:51:02,477
You still after that coke
that took a walk out of that bloodbath

759
00:51:02,519 --> 00:51:04,354
- in the harbor yesterday?
- Yeah.

760
00:51:04,438 --> 00:51:07,149
Well, you can stop looking.
There was no coke.

761
00:51:07,232 --> 00:51:10,026
I've been in LA County talking to a guy
they pulled out of a drainpipe

762
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:12,696
in San Pedro yesterday after the shootout.

763
00:51:12,779 --> 00:51:14,823
He came to this morning,
he started talking.

764
00:51:14,865 --> 00:51:16,116
He's part of a Hungarian mob

765
00:51:16,158 --> 00:51:18,160
there to do a deal
with a bunch of gwats from Argentina,

766
00:51:18,201 --> 00:51:20,787
and he says
it was definitely not a dope deal.

767
00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:22,080
- But the 91 million...
- Yeah. We know.

768
00:51:22,164 --> 00:51:24,166
But our man says no way on the dope.

769
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:25,834
This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch

770
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:27,836
was pulling stumps for Turkey
the next day.

771
00:51:27,878 --> 00:51:29,755
They had no time to negotiate
that kind of product

772
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:31,631
and no means to move it.

773
00:51:31,673 --> 00:51:33,759
- What's the money for?
- He didn't know.

774
00:51:33,842 --> 00:51:36,845
No one doing the deal knew
except for a few key people.

775
00:51:36,887 --> 00:51:39,306
They were all very hush about it, he says.

776
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:43,560
- Whatever it was, it was very sensitive.
- I don't get it.

777
00:51:43,643 --> 00:51:45,896
They tell me you got the cripple in there
from New York?

778
00:51:45,979 --> 00:51:47,731
- Yeah.
- Did he mention Keyser Soze?

779
00:51:47,814 --> 00:51:48,857
Who?

780
00:51:49,649 --> 00:51:51,526
Just bear with me here.

781
00:51:53,069 --> 00:51:55,864
- Who's Keyser Soze?
- Oh, fuck!

782
00:51:56,865 --> 00:52:00,035
We've been going over this
for an hour and a half.

783
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:02,496
What we need to do
is find Redfoot, Keaton...

784
00:52:02,537 --> 00:52:04,417
- Listen.
- ...and get the hell out of here, now.

785
00:52:04,456 --> 00:52:06,541
What we need to do is think.

786
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:07,959
Think back.

787
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:11,755
Somebody with power,

788
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:15,550
somebody who was capable of tracking
us from New York to Los Angeles.

789
00:52:15,634 --> 00:52:17,511
Come on, Dean,
what the hell are we doing here?

790
00:52:17,552 --> 00:52:18,887
We're waiting.

791
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:20,388
- Sit down.
- Bye, now.

792
00:52:20,472 --> 00:52:21,473
- Sit down.
- No.

793
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:23,308
It's hot and I'm fucking bored.

794
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:25,185
Mr. Hockney, do stay.

795
00:52:25,894 --> 00:52:27,270
Mr. Keaton.

796
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:29,981
Mr. Fenster I recognize
from his mug shots,

797
00:52:30,065 --> 00:52:34,236
as well as Mr. McManus.
I can only assume that you are Mr. Kint,

798
00:52:34,277 --> 00:52:36,947
the gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg.

799
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:40,742
My employer sends his gratitude,
a most unexpected benefit.

800
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:43,662
I am Mr. Kobayashi.

801
00:52:43,745 --> 00:52:48,375
I have been asked by my employer
to bring a proposal to you gentlemen.

802
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:49,417
What do you want?

803
00:52:49,501 --> 00:52:52,546
My employer requires
your services, gentlemen.

804
00:52:53,755 --> 00:52:57,551
One job, one day's work. Very dangerous.

805
00:52:57,592 --> 00:53:01,221
He does not expect all of you to live,
but those of you who do

806
00:53:01,263 --> 00:53:05,308
will have $91 million to divide
between you in any way you see fit.

807
00:53:05,392 --> 00:53:06,977
Who's your boss?

808
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:10,897
I work for Keyser Soze.

809
00:53:22,158 --> 00:53:23,410
Who's Keyser Soze?

810
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:25,954
Judging by the sudden change
in mood, Mr. Kint,

811
00:53:25,996 --> 00:53:29,124
I feel sure the rest of your associates
can tell you.

812
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:32,085
I come with an offer
directly from Mr. Soze.

813
00:53:32,335 --> 00:53:36,047
- An order, actually.
- What do you mean, "an order"?

814
00:53:36,256 --> 00:53:38,008
In 1981, Mr. Keaton,

815
00:53:38,091 --> 00:53:41,761
you participated in the hijacking
of a truck in Buffalo, New York.

816
00:53:41,803 --> 00:53:45,473
The cargo was raw steel,
steel which belonged to Mr. Soze

817
00:53:45,515 --> 00:53:49,686
and which was destined for Pakistan
to be used in a nuclear reactor.

818
00:53:49,811 --> 00:53:52,981
A most profitable violation
of UN Regulations.

819
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:55,191
You had no way of knowing this,
Mr. Keaton,

820
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:58,361
because the fellow shipping the steel
was working for Mr. Soze

821
00:53:58,445 --> 00:54:00,280
without his knowledge.

822
00:54:00,322 --> 00:54:03,033
Earlier this year,
Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus

823
00:54:03,116 --> 00:54:06,870
hijacked a two-prop cargo flight
out of Newark airport.

824
00:54:06,953 --> 00:54:09,623
The plane was carrying
gold and platinum wiring

825
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:11,750
also set for Pakistan.

826
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:15,337
Two months ago,
Mr. Hockney stole a truck

827
00:54:15,378 --> 00:54:17,923
carrying gun parts through Queens.

828
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:19,925
Gun parts which were set to be destroyed

829
00:54:20,008 --> 00:54:21,760
by the state of New York.

830
00:54:21,843 --> 00:54:25,680
They were to be lost in a way station
and rerouted to Belfast.

831
00:54:25,722 --> 00:54:29,017
Again, Mr. Soze using pawns
who had no knowledge.

832
00:54:29,059 --> 00:54:31,186
Which brings us to Mr. Kint.

833
00:54:32,395 --> 00:54:34,981
Nine months ago, one of Mr. Soze's

834
00:54:35,023 --> 00:54:39,611
less-than-intelligent couriers was taken
in a complicated confidence scam

835
00:54:40,362 --> 00:54:41,780
by a cripple.

836
00:54:42,155 --> 00:54:44,574
He was relieved of $62,000.

837
00:54:45,283 --> 00:54:48,119
Now, it has taken us
some time to find you.

838
00:54:48,578 --> 00:54:52,540
Our intention was to approach you
after your apprehension in New York.

839
00:54:52,624 --> 00:54:54,709
- You set up the lineup.
- Yes.

840
00:54:54,793 --> 00:54:57,295
You were not to be released
until I had come to see you.

841
00:54:57,379 --> 00:55:00,507
It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney,
Ms. Finneran,

842
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:04,302
was a little too effective
in expediting his release.

843
00:55:04,386 --> 00:55:06,680
Holding the rest of you
became a moot point.

844
00:55:06,721 --> 00:55:09,432
- What about Redfoot?
- Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.

845
00:55:09,557 --> 00:55:12,060
Mr. Soze rarely works
with the same people for very long

846
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:14,187
and they never know
who they're working for.

847
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:18,066
One cannot be betrayed
if one has no people.

848
00:55:19,067 --> 00:55:21,152
So, why are you telling us?

849
00:55:21,486 --> 00:55:25,657
Because you have stolen from Mr. Soze,
Mr. Fenster.

850
00:55:25,907 --> 00:55:26,950
All of you.

851
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:29,119
That you did not know you stole from him

852
00:55:29,202 --> 00:55:31,246
is the only reason you are still alive.

853
00:55:31,287 --> 00:55:34,958
He feels you owe him.
You will repay your debt.

854
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:39,629
All right, fuck the debt, and fuck you.
How do we know you work for Soze?

855
00:55:39,713 --> 00:55:42,549
I don't think that is very relevant,
Mr. Hockney.

856
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:45,760
All five of you are responsible
for the murder of Saul Berg

857
00:55:45,844 --> 00:55:47,137
and his bodyguards.

858
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:50,015
Mr. Redfoot can testify
to your involvement

859
00:55:50,098 --> 00:55:51,891
and we can see to it that he will.

860
00:55:51,933 --> 00:55:55,270
- What's your point?
- The offer is this, gentlemen.

861
00:55:55,311 --> 00:55:57,605
Mr. Soze's primary interest

862
00:55:57,772 --> 00:55:59,274
is narcotics.

863
00:55:59,441 --> 00:56:02,110
He has been competing, shall we say,

864
00:56:02,193 --> 00:56:04,821
with a group of Argentineans
for several years, now.

865
00:56:04,904 --> 00:56:07,741
Competing with Mr. Soze
has taken its toll.

866
00:56:08,491 --> 00:56:11,286
These Argentineans
are negotiating the sale

867
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:15,373
of $91 million in cocaine
in three days' time.

868
00:56:15,457 --> 00:56:18,293
Needless to say,
this purchase will revitalize

869
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:21,463
the diminishing strength
of their organization.

870
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:25,133
Mr. Soze would like you to stop the deal.

871
00:56:26,301 --> 00:56:29,054
Now, if you choose,
you may wait until after the buy.

872
00:56:29,137 --> 00:56:31,723
Whatever money changes hands is yours.

873
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:35,018
Mr. Soze would like you to get to the boat

874
00:56:35,101 --> 00:56:37,479
and destroy the cocaine on board.

875
00:56:38,104 --> 00:56:42,067
And then you will be free
of your obligations to Mr. Soze.

876
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:48,281
You give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kill you right now.

877
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:52,368
A gift from Mr. Soze.

878
00:56:55,789 --> 00:56:57,540
Good day, gentlemen.

879
00:58:06,693 --> 00:58:10,238
They got my whole life in here,
everything I've ever done since I was 18.

880
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:12,407
They fucking know everything.

881
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:15,660
Everybody I've ever worked with
or did time with.

882
00:58:29,757 --> 00:58:30,758
No.

883
00:58:33,094 --> 00:58:35,263
- This isn't right.
- I don't know.

884
00:58:35,346 --> 00:58:37,724
Who's that guy used to
talk about Soze in New York?

885
00:58:40,101 --> 00:58:44,272
- Bricks Marlin.
- Yeah, he did jobs for him, indirect stuff.

886
00:58:44,856 --> 00:58:46,983
And he said he always made
five times more money on it

887
00:58:47,066 --> 00:58:48,985
than the job was worth.

888
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:50,945
This guy's a pipe dream.

889
00:58:51,029 --> 00:58:53,656
Kobayashi's using him
for window dressing.

890
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,783
I don't know. This is bad.

891
00:58:55,867 --> 00:58:57,202
No, it's bullshit.

892
00:58:57,285 --> 00:59:00,538
This guy could be LAPD.
It's a fucking setup.

893
00:59:00,622 --> 00:59:03,791
The way I hear it,
Soze's some kind of butcher.

894
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:08,087
- A peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher.
- There is no Keyser Soze!

895
00:59:10,882 --> 00:59:12,634
Who is Keyser Soze?

896
00:59:13,635 --> 00:59:17,472
He's supposed to be Turkish.
Some say his father was German.

897
00:59:17,555 --> 00:59:19,807
Nobody ever believed he was real.

898
00:59:19,849 --> 00:59:23,186
Nobody ever knew him or saw anybody
that ever worked directly for him,

899
00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:26,189
but to hear Kobayashi tell it,
anybody could have worked for Soze.

900
00:59:26,272 --> 00:59:28,816
You never knew. That was his power.

901
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:33,571
The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled

902
00:59:33,655 --> 00:59:36,491
was convincing the world he didn't exist.

903
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:40,745
One story the guys told me,
the story I believe,

904
00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:42,622
was from his days in Turkey.

905
00:59:42,664 --> 00:59:45,500
There was a gang of Hungarians
that wanted their own mob.

906
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:49,003
They realized that to be in power,
you didn't need guns

907
00:59:49,045 --> 00:59:50,505
or money or even numbers.

908
00:59:50,588 --> 00:59:54,300
You just needed the will
to do what the other guy wouldn't.

909
00:59:54,342 --> 00:59:57,762
After a while, they come into power
and then they come after Soze.

910
00:59:57,845 --> 01:00:01,140
He was small-time then.
Just running dope, they say.

911
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:04,894
They come to his home

912
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,897
<i>in the afternoon looking for his business.</i>

913
01:00:07,981 --> 01:00:09,649
<i>They find his wife and kids in the house</i>

914
01:00:09,691 --> 01:00:11,859
<i>and decide to wait for Soze.</i>

915
01:00:28,001 --> 01:00:32,338
<i>He comes home to find
his wife raped and children screaming.</i>

916
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:35,717
<i>The Hungarians knew Soze was tough,
not to be trifled with,</i>

917
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,552
so they let him know they meant business.

918
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:40,179
<i>No!</i>

919
01:00:42,932 --> 01:00:46,436
<i>They tell him they want his territory,
all his business.</i>

920
01:00:46,811 --> 01:00:50,648
Soze looks over the faces of his family,

921
01:00:52,275 --> 01:00:55,737
then he showed these men of will
what will really was.

922
01:01:15,298 --> 01:01:18,509
<i>He tells him he would
rather see his family dead</i>

923
01:01:18,676 --> 01:01:21,095
<i>than live another day after this.</i>

924
01:01:22,347 --> 01:01:24,766
<i>He lets the last Hungarian go,</i>

925
01:01:24,807 --> 01:01:26,893
waits until his wife and kids
are in the ground

926
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:29,228
and then he goes after the rest of the mob.

927
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:31,773
He kills their kids, he kills their wives,

928
01:01:31,814 --> 01:01:34,275
he kills their parents
and their parents' friends.

929
01:01:34,776 --> 01:01:37,403
<i>He burns down the houses they live in</i>

930
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:40,114
<i>and the stores they work in.</i>

931
01:01:40,198 --> 01:01:43,743
<i>He kills people that owe them money.
And like that,</i>

932
01:01:45,078 --> 01:01:47,080
he's gone, underground.

933
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:49,624
Nobody's ever seen him since.
He becomes a myth.

934
01:01:49,707 --> 01:01:52,794
A spook story
that criminals tell their kids at night.

935
01:01:52,835 --> 01:01:55,963
"Rat on your pop,
and Keyser Soze will get you."

936
01:01:56,964 --> 01:01:59,175
And no one ever really believes.

937
01:01:59,258 --> 01:02:01,511
Do you believe in him, Verbal?

938
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:05,431
Keaton always said,

939
01:02:05,681 --> 01:02:08,976
"I don't believe in God,
but I'm afraid of him."

940
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:12,939
Well, I believe in God,

941
01:02:13,481 --> 01:02:17,360
and the only thing that scares me
is Keyser Soze.

942
01:02:24,492 --> 01:02:26,536
You give any weight to this?

943
01:02:26,619 --> 01:02:28,996
I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser
from Justice.

944
01:02:29,038 --> 01:02:30,832
He's got a file on Soze in DC.

945
01:02:30,915 --> 01:02:32,834
Been a hobby of his for a couple of years.

946
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:36,129
A lot of  guys equate him to that reporter
on The Incredible Hulk.</i>

947
01:02:41,509 --> 01:02:43,678
- You've heard of him?
- What, on the street?

948
01:02:43,761 --> 01:02:45,221
- Yeah.
- Yeah, a few times.

949
01:02:45,304 --> 01:02:47,515
You know, outside stuff.

950
01:02:47,557 --> 01:02:49,767
Somebody working for a guy
who worked for a guy

951
01:02:49,851 --> 01:02:51,519
who got some money from Keyser Soze.

952
01:02:51,561 --> 01:02:54,021
You know, shit like that.

953
01:02:54,105 --> 01:02:56,482
You know, it could be an old badge.
You know, a hex sign.

954
01:02:56,524 --> 01:02:57,650
Keep people from fucking with you

955
01:02:57,692 --> 01:02:59,360
back when a name
used to mean something.

956
01:02:59,444 --> 01:03:01,696
- But you're here.
- Well, shit, yeah.

957
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:03,030
I got a guy trying to
walk out of a hospital

958
01:03:03,072 --> 01:03:05,366
on a fried drumstick
because he's afraid of Soze.

959
01:03:06,367 --> 01:03:08,786
Yeah, I'll run it up the flagpole.

960
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:12,707
I came clean.
I told it like it happened on the boat.

961
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:14,375
So what if I left out how I got there?

962
01:03:14,459 --> 01:03:17,545
It's so full of holes, the DA would've
told me to blow amnesty out my ass.

963
01:03:17,628 --> 01:03:19,755
So you got what you wanted out of me,
so big fucking deal.

964
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:22,967
- So that's why you never told the DA?
- Well, you tell me, Agent Kujan.

965
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:25,261
If I told you the Loch Ness monster
hired me to hit the harbor,

966
01:03:25,344 --> 01:03:27,145
- what would you say?
- Turn State's evidence.

967
01:03:27,221 --> 01:03:28,598
We'll put you on the stand,
we'll hear it out.

968
01:03:28,681 --> 01:03:31,142
I've got immunity now.
What can you possibly offer me?

969
01:03:31,225 --> 01:03:34,270
If there really is a Keyser Soze,
he's gonna come looking for you.

970
01:03:35,396 --> 01:03:37,398
Where's your head, Agent Kujan?

971
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,066
Where do you think
the pressure's coming from?

972
01:03:39,108 --> 01:03:40,902
Keyser Soze,
or whatever you wanna call him,

973
01:03:40,943 --> 01:03:42,403
he knows where I am right now.

974
01:03:42,528 --> 01:03:44,608
He's got the front burner
under your ass to let me go

975
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:46,824
so he can scoop me up ten minutes later.

976
01:03:46,908 --> 01:03:48,784
Immunity was just a deal
with you assholes.

977
01:03:48,868 --> 01:03:50,745
I got a whole new problem
when I post bail.

978
01:03:50,828 --> 01:03:53,498
So why play into his hands?
We can protect you.

979
01:03:53,581 --> 01:03:57,793
Oh, gee. Thanks, Dave.
Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion.

980
01:03:57,877 --> 01:03:59,921
You'll pardon me
if I ask you to kiss my pucker.

981
01:04:00,004 --> 01:04:02,298
The same fuckers that rounded us up
and sank us into this mess

982
01:04:02,381 --> 01:04:04,800
are now bailing me out? Fuck you.

983
01:04:06,928 --> 01:04:09,555
You think you can catch Keyser Soze?

984
01:04:09,597 --> 01:04:12,558
You think a guy like that
comes this close to getting caught

985
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,393
and sticks his head out?

986
01:04:14,435 --> 01:04:17,480
If he comes up for anything,
it'll be to get rid of me.

987
01:04:17,563 --> 01:04:19,440
After that,

988
01:04:19,524 --> 01:04:22,568
my guess is
you'll never hear from him again.

989
01:04:44,423 --> 01:04:46,008
What happened next?

990
01:04:46,342 --> 01:04:49,053
We woke up the next morning
and Fenster was gone.

991
01:04:49,136 --> 01:04:51,931
He couldn't handle the idea
of slumming for Soze.

992
01:04:51,973 --> 01:04:53,808
He left us a note wishing us good luck

993
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:56,644
and took a chunk of the money
we'd scraped together.

994
01:04:56,727 --> 01:04:57,979
Then what?

995
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:59,480
Well, McManus was furious.

996
01:04:59,564 --> 01:05:02,124
He was talking about tracking him down
and ripping his heart out.

997
01:05:02,149 --> 01:05:03,859
All sorts of shit.

998
01:05:04,652 --> 01:05:06,821
That night, we got the call.

999
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,322
What call?

1000
01:05:08,489 --> 01:05:10,908
Kobayashi told us
where we could find Fenster.

1001
01:05:18,916 --> 01:05:21,210
All right,
let's get the fuck outta here.

1002
01:05:22,962 --> 01:05:24,672
We gotta bury him.

1003
01:05:24,755 --> 01:05:26,090
With what?

1004
01:05:26,507 --> 01:05:28,009
With our hands.

1005
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:39,520
Oh, this is nuts.

1006
01:05:39,562 --> 01:05:41,480
It's dry fucking sand, McManus.

1007
01:05:41,522 --> 01:05:45,109
When he rots, the surfers
are gonna smell him a mile away.

1008
01:05:45,192 --> 01:05:47,153
- Dig, you fuck.
- Keaton, what are we gonna do?

1009
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:49,196
This fucking guy is gonna kill us.

1010
01:05:49,238 --> 01:05:50,823
I don't know about you, peg-leg,
but I can run.

1011
01:05:50,865 --> 01:05:53,034
I got no problem with that.

1012
01:05:53,993 --> 01:05:57,538
Kobayashi doesn't seem
to have a problem with it either.

1013
01:05:58,122 --> 01:06:00,791
You run, and we're gonna be
digging a hole for you.

1014
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:02,335
You got that?

1015
01:06:02,835 --> 01:06:06,881
This ain't my boy we're burying.
I don't owe anybody!

1016
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:11,052
- So fuck you.
- He was my partner for five years.

1017
01:06:11,135 --> 01:06:13,763
We did more jobs and I saw more money

1018
01:06:13,846 --> 01:06:16,390
than you can ever count. So fuck you!

1019
01:06:16,891 --> 01:06:19,810
- 'Cause now it's payback!
- It's not payback!

1020
01:06:23,022 --> 01:06:24,565
It's precaution.

1021
01:06:24,649 --> 01:06:27,693
You want payback? You wanna run?
I don't care.

1022
01:06:30,571 --> 01:06:32,907
I'm not doing this for Fenster.

1023
01:06:33,616 --> 01:06:35,618
I'm not doing it for you.

1024
01:06:37,078 --> 01:06:38,954
I'm doing this for me.

1025
01:06:40,748 --> 01:06:42,917
I'm gonna finish this thing.

1026
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:46,420
This Kobayashi bastard
is not gonna stand on me.

1027
01:07:07,608 --> 01:07:09,944
And after they killed Fenster,
nobody would run?

1028
01:07:09,985 --> 01:07:12,446
I wanted to.
I thought we could make it.

1029
01:07:12,488 --> 01:07:13,948
Why didn't you say anything?

1030
01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:16,617
Believe me, I tried,
but Keaton wouldn't have it.

1031
01:07:16,701 --> 01:07:18,536
It was too far-fetched for him.

1032
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:21,163
Keaton was a grounded guy, an ex-cop.

1033
01:07:21,247 --> 01:07:23,999
To a cop, the explanation
is never that complicated.

1034
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:25,793
It's always simple.

1035
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:28,629
There's no mystery to the street,
no arch-criminal behind it all.

1036
01:07:28,713 --> 01:07:30,673
If you got a dead body
and you think his brother did it,

1037
01:07:30,756 --> 01:07:32,299
you're gonna find out you're right.

1038
01:07:32,341 --> 01:07:33,592
Nobody argued with Keaton.

1039
01:07:33,634 --> 01:07:36,345
They just set their minds
to whacking Kobayashi.

1040
01:07:46,814 --> 01:07:47,898
They're coming up.

1041
01:07:49,608 --> 01:07:52,194
<i>Did you hear me?
He's coming up.</i>

1042
01:07:52,278 --> 01:07:53,738
He's on his way down.

1043
01:08:50,586 --> 01:08:51,962
Don't move.

1044
01:08:52,379 --> 01:08:54,089
Press 20. Do it now.

1045
01:09:14,568 --> 01:09:15,653
Move.

1046
01:09:19,073 --> 01:09:22,159
- The answer is no.
- Mr. Soze will be most upset.

1047
01:09:22,243 --> 01:09:24,245
Listen, you cocksucker,
there is no Keyser Soze.

1048
01:09:24,328 --> 01:09:26,330
You mention his name again,
and I'll kill you right now.

1049
01:09:26,413 --> 01:09:27,998
A strange threat, Mr. Keaton.

1050
01:09:28,082 --> 01:09:31,460
I can only assume that
you've come here to kill me anyway.

1051
01:09:36,173 --> 01:09:38,717
We know that you can get to us,

1052
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:42,263
but now you know that we can get to you.

1053
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:45,850
I'm giving you one last chance
to call this off.

1054
01:09:45,933 --> 01:09:46,934
Mr. So...

1055
01:09:47,434 --> 01:09:49,520
My employer has made up his mind.

1056
01:09:49,603 --> 01:09:52,606
- He does not change it.
- Neither do we.

1057
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:55,568
You got Fenster,
but you won't be able to get all of us,

1058
01:09:55,609 --> 01:09:57,778
not before one of us gets through to you.

1059
01:09:57,862 --> 01:10:01,407
I believe you, Mr. McManus.
I most sincerely do.

1060
01:10:02,116 --> 01:10:04,827
You would not have been chosen,
were you not so suitable.

1061
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:08,205
But I cannot make this decision.
Whatever you threaten me with is

1062
01:10:08,956 --> 01:10:11,834
ludicrous in comparison
to what will be done to me

1063
01:10:11,917 --> 01:10:14,670
if I do not carry out my orders in full.

1064
01:10:21,927 --> 01:10:24,346
I'm the guy that's gonna get you.

1065
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:28,475
I just wanted you to know that.

1066
01:10:29,268 --> 01:10:31,312
I'm so sorry, Mr. McManus.

1067
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:34,440
I implore you, Mr. Keaton, believe me,

1068
01:10:34,648 --> 01:10:37,985
Mr. Soze is very real and very determined.

1069
01:10:38,068 --> 01:10:39,194
We'll see.

1070
01:10:46,994 --> 01:10:50,664
Before you do me in, Mr. McManus,

1071
01:10:50,706 --> 01:10:54,209
you will let me finish my business
with Ms. Finneran first, won't you?

1072
01:10:55,044 --> 01:10:56,170
Fuck.

1073
01:10:59,757 --> 01:11:01,383
What did you say?

1074
01:11:02,343 --> 01:11:04,136
Edie Finneran.

1075
01:11:04,178 --> 01:11:06,347
She's upstairs in my office

1076
01:11:06,805 --> 01:11:09,058
for an extradition deposition.

1077
01:11:10,017 --> 01:11:12,853
I requested she be put
on the case personally.

1078
01:11:12,937 --> 01:11:14,855
She flew in yesterday.

1079
01:11:16,732 --> 01:11:18,067
No matter.

1080
01:11:18,525 --> 01:11:20,486
Kill away, Mr. McManus.

1081
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:26,700
You're lying.

1082
01:11:27,284 --> 01:11:28,369
Am I?

1083
01:11:45,803 --> 01:11:49,556
Ms. Finneran's escort
while she's here in Los Angeles.

1084
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,475
Never leaves her side for a moment.

1085
01:11:51,558 --> 01:11:54,895
I thought you would be glad to know
she's in good hands.

1086
01:11:58,857 --> 01:12:01,735
Now, get some rest.
The boat will be ready for you on Friday.

1087
01:12:01,777 --> 01:12:04,488
If I see you
or any of your friends before then,

1088
01:12:04,571 --> 01:12:08,242
Ms. Finneran will find herself the victim
of a most gruesome violation

1089
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:09,368
before she dies.

1090
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:12,329
As indeed will your father, Mr. Hockney,

1091
01:12:12,413 --> 01:12:15,499
and your Uncle Randall in Arizona,
Mr. Kint.

1092
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:19,753
I might only castrate
Mr. McManus' nephew, David.

1093
01:12:22,631 --> 01:12:24,550
Do I make myself clear?

1094
01:12:25,092 --> 01:12:27,469
We will take care
of the two bodies downstairs.

1095
01:12:27,553 --> 01:12:30,389
We'll add them to the cost of Mr. Fenster.

1096
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:32,975
Now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

1097
01:13:11,013 --> 01:13:13,307
It's a logistical nightmare.

1098
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:16,143
Close quarters, 10, maybe 20 men.

1099
01:13:16,935 --> 01:13:19,646
There's no telling how many more
are gonna be below deck.

1100
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:22,149
- Can we stealth these guys?
- Nah.

1101
01:13:22,483 --> 01:13:24,735
With all that coke, they're gonna be ready.

1102
01:13:26,403 --> 01:13:28,739
Which brings me
to sunny point number two.

1103
01:13:29,406 --> 01:13:32,951
Even if one of us gets through
and jacks the boat, we still get nothing.

1104
01:13:32,993 --> 01:13:35,204
What if we wait for the money?

1105
01:13:35,287 --> 01:13:37,164
Ten more men, at least.

1106
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:41,126
Look, in my opinion, it can't be done.

1107
01:13:41,168 --> 01:13:43,337
Anybody who goes in there
is not coming out alive.

1108
01:13:43,378 --> 01:13:46,340
- I'm gonna wait for the money.
- Me, too.

1109
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:49,927
- Did you hear what he just said?
- If I'm going in, I want a cut.

1110
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:51,220
Me, too.

1111
01:13:52,721 --> 01:13:55,224
There's nothing that can't be done.

1112
01:13:57,768 --> 01:14:01,396
I just can't believe
we're gonna walk into certain death.

1113
01:14:07,694 --> 01:14:10,364
The news said it's raining in New York.

1114
01:14:31,927 --> 01:14:33,554
What language is that?

1115
01:14:33,887 --> 01:14:36,932
I don't know. Russian, I think.

1116
01:14:38,892 --> 01:14:40,227
Hungarian.

1117
01:15:44,416 --> 01:15:46,919
The package has arrived, gentlemen.

1118
01:16:06,813 --> 01:16:08,357
You kids ready?

1119
01:16:08,857 --> 01:16:11,652
I would be if I didn't have to stop
and answer you.

1120
01:16:11,693 --> 01:16:13,153
I'm ready.

1121
01:16:13,195 --> 01:16:16,114
McManus, you better be set up
in 10 seconds.

1122
01:16:18,075 --> 01:16:19,409
I'm ready.

1123
01:16:20,869 --> 01:16:22,829
I want you to stay here.

1124
01:16:23,664 --> 01:16:26,124
- I'm supposed to cover...
- Listen, if we don't get out of this,

1125
01:16:26,166 --> 01:16:27,960
I want you to take the money and go.

1126
01:16:28,001 --> 01:16:29,586
- Keaton, I can't...
- Find Edie.

1127
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:31,546
Tell her what happened.
Tell her everything.

1128
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:33,757
She knows people. She knows what to do.

1129
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,802
If I don't get Kobayashi my way,
she'll get him her way.

1130
01:16:36,843 --> 01:16:39,304
- What if I...
- Please, just do what I say.

1131
01:16:40,055 --> 01:16:41,265
Please.

1132
01:16:44,476 --> 01:16:45,936
Tell her that...

1133
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:51,316
Tell her I tried.

1134
01:17:04,579 --> 01:17:07,291
<i>McManus, he's on his way.</i>

1135
01:17:07,374 --> 01:17:08,709
I'm there.

1136
01:18:00,761 --> 01:18:04,473
One, two, three, four,

1137
01:18:05,182 --> 01:18:07,809
five, six, seven.

1138
01:18:09,269 --> 01:18:10,937
Oswald was a fag.

1139
01:18:19,321 --> 01:18:20,364
Hi.

1140
01:18:21,281 --> 01:18:22,783
How you doing?

1141
01:18:25,452 --> 01:18:27,662
Is there... ls there a problem?

1142
01:18:53,438 --> 01:18:54,523
Now.

1143
01:20:09,306 --> 01:20:10,849
Elvis has left the building.

1144
01:21:38,103 --> 01:21:39,312
Hello.

1145
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,035
<i>Why didn't you run?</i>

1146
01:22:35,869 --> 01:22:37,245
I froze up.

1147
01:22:38,038 --> 01:22:41,458
I thought about Fenster
and how he looked when we buried him.

1148
01:22:41,541 --> 01:22:44,377
And then I thought about Keaton,
it looked like he might pull it off.

1149
01:22:52,302 --> 01:22:54,054
A boy came across a body
on the beach this morning.

1150
01:22:54,137 --> 01:22:56,418
Thrown clear when the boat burned.
Shot twice in the head.

1151
01:22:56,431 --> 01:22:58,391
Two guys from
the Bureau just identified him.

1152
01:22:58,433 --> 01:23:00,894
- What else?
- His name was Arturro Marquez,

1153
01:23:00,977 --> 01:23:02,604
a petty smuggler from Argentina.

1154
01:23:02,687 --> 01:23:05,565
He was arrested last year in New York
for trafficking.

1155
01:23:05,607 --> 01:23:09,402
He escapes to California.
They pick him up in Long Beach.

1156
01:23:09,444 --> 01:23:12,864
They're setting up extradition,
he escapes again.

1157
01:23:12,906 --> 01:23:14,240
Now, get this.

1158
01:23:14,282 --> 01:23:17,911
Edie Finneran's brought in
to advise on the proceedings.

1159
01:23:17,994 --> 01:23:19,245
Kobayashi.

1160
01:23:19,329 --> 01:23:21,539
New York faxed me a copy
of his testimony.

1161
01:23:21,581 --> 01:23:24,167
- He was a rat.
- Yeah, a big fucking rat.

1162
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:27,003
Arturro was very opposed
to returning to prison.

1163
01:23:27,087 --> 01:23:30,965
So much so that he named
close to 50 people.

1164
01:23:31,216 --> 01:23:33,593
Guess who he named in the finale.

1165
01:23:34,552 --> 01:23:35,929
Keyser Soze.

1166
01:23:36,262 --> 01:23:37,764
There's more.

1167
01:23:49,943 --> 01:23:53,780
I'll tell you what I know.
Stop me when this sounds familiar.

1168
01:23:55,615 --> 01:23:57,951
There was no dope on that boat.

1169
01:24:39,743 --> 01:24:41,077
You, stay quiet.

1170
01:24:41,327 --> 01:24:42,662
He's here.

1171
01:24:43,246 --> 01:24:47,167
I know he's here. That's him.
I'm telling you, that's him.

1172
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:48,835
I know he's here!

1173
01:24:50,336 --> 01:24:53,298
- You can't understand. That's him.
- Shut up.

1174
01:24:53,339 --> 01:24:57,719
That's him, you hear me?
I'm telling you, it's Keyser Soze!

1175
01:26:56,421 --> 01:26:58,214
- Where's Hockney?
- I don't know.

1176
01:26:58,298 --> 01:26:59,883
There's no coke.

1177
01:27:00,133 --> 01:27:01,843
- What?
- You heard me, you dumb fuck.

1178
01:27:02,093 --> 01:27:03,136
There's no coke!

1179
01:27:03,177 --> 01:27:04,512
What the fuck do you mean,
there's no coke?

1180
01:27:04,596 --> 01:27:07,156
I've been up and down this ship.
I've been in every fucking room!

1181
01:27:07,181 --> 01:27:09,183
- There's gotta be coke!
- There is nothing!

1182
01:27:09,517 --> 01:27:10,768
Nothing!

1183
01:27:11,144 --> 01:27:12,812
Don't you fuck with me.

1184
01:27:12,854 --> 01:27:16,691
There is no fucking coke!

1185
01:27:27,619 --> 01:27:29,245
I'm outta here.

1186
01:28:10,328 --> 01:28:12,080
I told them nothing.

1187
01:28:13,247 --> 01:28:14,415
I swear.

1188
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:17,585
I told them nothing. Please.

1189
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:06,926
McManus, what the fuck is going on?

1190
01:29:09,595 --> 01:29:11,389
Strangest thing.

1191
01:30:05,985 --> 01:30:07,487
That's what you say
in your statement.

1192
01:30:07,528 --> 01:30:09,322
You saw a man in a suit with a slim build.

1193
01:30:09,405 --> 01:30:11,032
- Wait a minute.
- I don't have a minute.

1194
01:30:11,115 --> 01:30:13,034
Now, are you saying
you saw Keyser Soze?

1195
01:30:13,117 --> 01:30:14,952
You told the DA
you didn't know who it was.

1196
01:30:14,994 --> 01:30:16,621
I know there was dope on that boat.

1197
01:30:16,662 --> 01:30:18,206
- Stop stalling, Verbal.
- I'm not stalling.

1198
01:30:18,289 --> 01:30:19,832
- You know what I'm getting at.
- Get out of my face.

1199
01:30:19,916 --> 01:30:21,626
- You know what I'm getting at.
- I got immunity.

1200
01:30:21,667 --> 01:30:24,003
- I don't have to take that shit.
- You know what, you know what...

1201
01:30:24,087 --> 01:30:25,963
You know what I'm getting at, Verbal.
Yes, you do!

1202
01:30:26,005 --> 01:30:28,007
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- The truth!

1203
01:30:28,091 --> 01:30:30,009
Try to tell me
you saw someone kill Keaton.

1204
01:30:30,051 --> 01:30:31,636
I don't know what you're talking about.
I did. I did.

1205
01:30:31,677 --> 01:30:33,038
- You're lying to me.
- I am not...

1206
01:30:33,054 --> 01:30:35,348
You've known,
you've known this whole fucking time.

1207
01:30:35,389 --> 01:30:36,849
- I don't know what you're saying.
- You know.

1208
01:30:36,933 --> 01:30:39,268
I did see Keaton get shot, I swear to you.

1209
01:30:39,352 --> 01:30:41,187
Then why didn't you help him?
You had a gun.

1210
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:44,190
Why didn't you help him?
He was your friend.

1211
01:30:47,777 --> 01:30:49,570
Because I was afraid.

1212
01:30:50,363 --> 01:30:51,489
Okay?

1213
01:30:51,823 --> 01:30:53,783
- Afraid.
- Afraid of what?

1214
01:30:55,535 --> 01:30:57,703
- Afraid of...
- I knew it was Keyser Soze.

1215
01:30:57,787 --> 01:30:59,956
- But Keaton.
- It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan.

1216
01:31:00,039 --> 01:31:02,083
I mean, the Devil himself.

1217
01:31:03,167 --> 01:31:05,878
How do you shoot the Devil in the back?

1218
01:31:10,258 --> 01:31:11,884
What if you miss?

1219
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:19,142
All right. Let's get back to the pier.

1220
01:32:42,433 --> 01:32:45,895
- Arturro Marquez. Ever hear of him?
- What? No.

1221
01:32:45,978 --> 01:32:48,773
<i>He was a stool pigeon
for the Justice Department.</i>

1222
01:32:48,814 --> 01:32:50,816
He swore out a statement
to Federal marshals

1223
01:32:50,858 --> 01:32:54,528
saying that he had seen
and could positively identify one

1224
01:32:54,612 --> 01:32:55,863
<i>Keyser Soze.</i>

1225
01:32:56,322 --> 01:32:58,074
It says right here in the report.

1226
01:32:58,157 --> 01:33:00,451
He had intimate knowledge
of his businesses,

1227
01:33:00,493 --> 01:33:04,288
including, but not exclusive to,
drug trafficking and murder.

1228
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:06,040
I never heard of him.

1229
01:33:06,123 --> 01:33:08,668
His own people were selling him
to a gang of Hungarians.

1230
01:33:08,751 --> 01:33:12,588
<i>Most likely the same Hungarians that
Soze all but wiped out back in Turkey.</i>

1231
01:33:12,672 --> 01:33:14,507
The money wasn't there for dope.

1232
01:33:14,548 --> 01:33:17,093
The Hungarians were going
to buy the one guy

1233
01:33:17,176 --> 01:33:18,844
<i>that could incriminate Keyser Soze.</i>

1234
01:33:19,512 --> 01:33:21,889
- I said I never heard of him.
- But Keaton did.

1235
01:33:21,973 --> 01:33:25,017
<i>Edie Finneran was Marquez's
extradition advisor.</i>

1236
01:33:25,101 --> 01:33:26,581
<i>She knew who he was and what he knew.</i>

1237
01:33:27,061 --> 01:33:29,647
- I don't...
- There were no drugs on that boat.

1238
01:33:29,689 --> 01:33:30,982
It was a hit.

1239
01:33:31,023 --> 01:33:33,693
A suicide mission
to whack out the one guy

1240
01:33:33,776 --> 01:33:35,861
<i>that could finger Keyser Soze.</i>

1241
01:33:36,028 --> 01:33:38,239
<i>So, Soze put some thieves to it,</i>

1242
01:33:38,322 --> 01:33:40,700
<i>men he knew he could march
into certain death.</i>

1243
01:33:41,033 --> 01:33:43,869
You're saying Soze
sent us to kill someone?

1244
01:33:44,537 --> 01:33:47,707
<i>I'm saying Keaton did.
Verbal, he left you behind for a reason.</i>

1245
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:49,458
Just do what I tell you.

1246
01:33:49,542 --> 01:33:52,712
If you all knew that Soze
could find you anywhere,

1247
01:33:52,753 --> 01:33:54,755
why did he give you the money to run?

1248
01:33:54,839 --> 01:33:58,134
- He could have used you on the boat.
- He wanted me to live.

1249
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,430
<i>A one-time dirty cop
without a loyalty in the world</i>

1250
01:34:02,513 --> 01:34:05,891
<i>finds it in his heart
to save a worthless rat cripple?</i>

1251
01:34:05,975 --> 01:34:07,435
No, sir. Why?

1252
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:09,103
Edie.

1253
01:34:09,186 --> 01:34:11,772
<i>I don't buy that reform story
for a minute.</i>

1254
01:34:12,023 --> 01:34:13,232
Even if I did,

1255
01:34:13,274 --> 01:34:17,194
I certainly don't believe
he would send you to protect her.

1256
01:34:17,236 --> 01:34:18,446
So, Why?

1257
01:34:20,823 --> 01:34:22,742
Because he was my friend.

1258
01:34:22,783 --> 01:34:27,121
No, Verbal, he wasn't your friend.
Keaton didn't have friends.

1259
01:34:27,204 --> 01:34:28,247
What are you doing here?

1260
01:34:28,289 --> 01:34:31,042
He saved you
because he wanted it that way.

1261
01:34:31,083 --> 01:34:32,752
It was his will.

1262
01:34:32,835 --> 01:34:35,463
- Keaton was Keyser Soze.
- No.

1263
01:34:35,546 --> 01:34:37,715
<i>The kind of man
who could wrangle the wills of men</i>

1264
01:34:37,757 --> 01:34:39,091
<i>like Hockney and McManus.</i>

1265
01:34:39,175 --> 01:34:41,719
<i>The kind of man
who could engineer a police lineup</i>

1266
01:34:41,761 --> 01:34:44,555
<i>through all his years of contacts in NYPD.</i>

1267
01:34:44,597 --> 01:34:47,141
The kind of man
who could've killed Edie Finneran.

1268
01:34:52,146 --> 01:34:54,982
She was found yesterday
at a hotel in Pennsylvania,

1269
01:34:55,066 --> 01:34:56,942
shot twice in the head.

1270
01:35:01,822 --> 01:35:04,658
What do you think
about Keaton now, Verbal?

1271
01:35:05,951 --> 01:35:06,952
Edie?

1272
01:35:07,036 --> 01:35:09,121
He used all of you to get him on that boat.

1273
01:35:09,205 --> 01:35:12,792
<i>He couldn't get on alone.
He had to pull the trigger himself</i>

1274
01:35:12,875 --> 01:35:14,752
to make sure he got his man,

1275
01:35:14,794 --> 01:35:17,338
the one man that could identify him.

1276
01:35:17,922 --> 01:35:19,799
This is all bullshit.

1277
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,842
You said you saw him die.

1278
01:35:24,512 --> 01:35:25,513
<i>Or did you?</i>

1279
01:35:25,596 --> 01:35:27,807
You had to hide
when you first heard the police cars.

1280
01:35:27,848 --> 01:35:30,643
<i>You said you heard the shot
before the fire,</i>

1281
01:35:30,726 --> 01:35:32,770
but you didn't see him die.

1282
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:35,815
- I knew him. He would never...
- He programmed you.

1283
01:35:35,898 --> 01:35:38,651
<i>He programmed you to tell us
just what he wanted you to.</i>

1284
01:35:38,692 --> 01:35:40,820
<i>He knew we were close,
you said it yourself.</i>

1285
01:35:40,903 --> 01:35:42,663
<i>Where was the political pressure
coming from?</i>

1286
01:35:42,738 --> 01:35:45,241
Why were you being protected?
It was Keaton.

1287
01:35:45,324 --> 01:35:48,869
- Immunity was your reward.
- But why me?

1288
01:35:49,203 --> 01:35:51,455
Why not Fenster or McManus or Hockney?

1289
01:35:51,497 --> 01:35:54,125
Why me? I'm stupid, I'm a cripple.
Why me?

1290
01:35:54,166 --> 01:35:56,043
Because you're a cripple, Verbal.

1291
01:35:56,127 --> 01:35:58,003
Because you're stupid.

1292
01:35:58,087 --> 01:36:00,423
Because you're weaker than them.

1293
01:36:04,343 --> 01:36:05,719
If he's dead,

1294
01:36:06,053 --> 01:36:09,348
if what you say is true,
then it won't matter.

1295
01:36:11,517 --> 01:36:14,395
It was his idea to hit the taxi service
in New York, wasn't it?

1296
01:36:14,478 --> 01:36:17,857
- Come on, tell me the truth.
- It was all Keaton.

1297
01:36:18,941 --> 01:36:21,694
We followed him from the beginning.

1298
01:36:23,237 --> 01:36:24,864
I didn't know.

1299
01:36:24,905 --> 01:36:26,866
I saw him die.

1300
01:36:27,491 --> 01:36:30,703
I believe he's dead. Oh, Christ.

1301
01:36:31,829 --> 01:36:33,998
You're not safe on your own.

1302
01:36:37,626 --> 01:36:39,086
You think he's...

1303
01:36:39,170 --> 01:36:40,754
Keyser Soze?

1304
01:36:41,547 --> 01:36:43,340
I don't know, Verbal.

1305
01:36:44,675 --> 01:36:48,220
Keyser Soze's a shield,
or like you said, a spook story.

1306
01:36:49,722 --> 01:36:54,059
But I know Keaton, and someone
is out there pulling strings for you.

1307
01:36:54,101 --> 01:36:57,730
- Stay here and let us protect you.
- No way, I'm not bait. I post today.

1308
01:36:57,813 --> 01:36:59,732
You posted 20 minutes ago.

1309
01:36:59,815 --> 01:37:02,067
Captain Leo wants you out of here ASAP,

1310
01:37:02,151 --> 01:37:05,404
- unless you turn State's.
- I'll take my chances, thank you.

1311
01:37:05,446 --> 01:37:09,158
If someone wants to get you,
they're gonna get you out there.

1312
01:37:09,241 --> 01:37:12,620
Turn State's evidence.
You might never see trial.

1313
01:37:12,703 --> 01:37:13,954
Maybe so.

1314
01:37:15,539 --> 01:37:17,875
But I'm not a rat, Agent Kujan.

1315
01:37:34,141 --> 01:37:35,601
Fucking cops.

1316
01:38:00,251 --> 01:38:02,920
Excuse me, can I use your fax machine?

1317
01:38:06,715 --> 01:38:09,468
You'll have to sign for these, Mr. Kint.

1318
01:38:11,554 --> 01:38:13,138
One watch, gold.

1319
01:38:13,639 --> 01:38:15,766
One cigarette lighter, gold.

1320
01:38:16,642 --> 01:38:19,061
One pack of cigarettes. Thank you.

1321
01:38:19,228 --> 01:38:21,313
We've still got nothing, Dave.

1322
01:38:21,647 --> 01:38:23,816
I know what I wanted to know
about Keaton.

1323
01:38:23,899 --> 01:38:25,526
Which is nothing.

1324
01:38:26,026 --> 01:38:29,613
No matter.
He'll have to know how close we came.

1325
01:38:30,155 --> 01:38:32,783
<i>Keyser Soze or no Keyser Soze,</i>

1326
01:38:33,075 --> 01:38:35,995
<i>if Keaton is alive,
he's not coming up again.</i>

1327
01:38:36,495 --> 01:38:37,997
<i>I'll find him.</i>

1328
01:38:38,706 --> 01:38:40,207
<i>Waste of time.</i>

1329
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:45,671
<i>A rumor's not a rumor that doesn't die.</i>

1330
01:38:45,921 --> 01:38:47,047
<i>What?</i>

1331
01:38:47,923 --> 01:38:48,966
<i>Nothing.</i>

1332
01:38:50,968 --> 01:38:52,886
Man, you're a slob.

1333
01:38:52,970 --> 01:38:55,514
Yeah, but it all has a system, Dave.

1334
01:38:56,181 --> 01:38:57,516
It all makes sense
when you look at it right.

1335
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:00,519
You gotta like stand back from it,
you know?

1336
01:39:01,895 --> 01:39:05,024
You wanna see a real horror show?
See my garage.

1337
01:39:42,353 --> 01:39:44,396
<i>Convince me and tell me
every last detail.</i>

1338
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:47,232
<i>You know, back when I was in that
barbershop quartet in Skokie, Illinois...</i>

1339
01:39:47,316 --> 01:39:48,776
<i>Where's your head, Agent Kujan?</i>

1340
01:39:48,859 --> 01:39:51,320
<i>What we need to do is think.
Think back.</i>

1341
01:39:51,403 --> 01:39:52,905
<i>I'm sure you've heard
many tall tales.</i>

1342
01:39:52,946 --> 01:39:54,531
<i>- Bricks Marlin.
- This isn't right.</i>

1343
01:39:54,573 --> 01:39:56,575
<i>I just wanna hear your story.
Tell me every last detail.</i>

1344
01:39:56,659 --> 01:39:58,494
<i>It's all there.
And I'm telling it straight, I swear.</i>

1345
01:39:58,577 --> 01:40:00,371
<i>Some guy in California,
his name is Redfoot.</i>

1346
01:40:00,412 --> 01:40:03,082
<i>- A gift from Mr. Soze.
- Talk to me, Verbal.</i>

1347
01:40:03,123 --> 01:40:06,293
<i>- What about Redfoot?
- Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.</i>

1348
01:40:06,377 --> 01:40:07,378
<i>Using pawns...</i>

1349
01:40:07,419 --> 01:40:09,171
<i>A big fat guy.
I mean, like, orca fat.</i>

1350
01:40:09,254 --> 01:40:11,090
<i>- There was a lawyer.
- Myths, legends.</i>

1351
01:40:11,173 --> 01:40:12,591
<i>Kobayashi.</i>

1352
01:40:13,050 --> 01:40:14,968
<i>Back when I was picking beans
in Guatemala,</i>

1353
01:40:15,052 --> 01:40:16,345
<i>we used to make fresh coffee.</i>

1354
01:40:16,595 --> 01:40:18,035
<i>I know you thought
he was a good man.</i>

1355
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:19,556
<i>I know he was good.</i>

1356
01:40:21,850 --> 01:40:24,937
You tell me every last detail.
The strangest thing.

1357
01:40:24,978 --> 01:40:26,605
<i>How do you shoot the Devil
in the back?</i>

1358
01:40:26,689 --> 01:40:29,441
<i>...Is protected from up on high

<i>Tell me every last detail.</i>

1360
01:40:30,609 --> 01:40:32,277
<i>What about it, pretzel man?
What's your story?</i>

1361
01:40:32,319 --> 01:40:34,363
<i>- There was a lawyer.
- What lawyer, Verbal?</i>

1362
01:40:34,446 --> 01:40:35,614
<i>I am Mr. Kobayashi.</i>

1363
01:40:35,656 --> 01:40:39,118
<i>- Kobayashi. Kobayashi.
- Tell me every last detail.</i>

1364
01:40:39,159 --> 01:40:42,162
<i>- I work for Keyser Soze.
- Convince me. Convince me.</i>

1365
01:40:57,761 --> 01:41:00,639
<i>Every creep and scumbag

<i>will know the name of Verbal Kint.</i>

1367
01:41:03,142 --> 01:41:04,768
The cripple, did you see him?

1368
01:41:04,810 --> 01:41:07,938
- The cripple! Which way did he go?
- Oh. He went out that way.

1369
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:10,607
<i>I know you know something.
I know you're not telling.</i>

1370
01:41:10,649 --> 01:41:12,735
<i>I'm smarter than you
and I'm gonna find out</i>

1371
01:41:12,818 --> 01:41:14,153
<i>what I wanna know
whether you like it or not.</i>

1372

<i>To a cop, the explanation is never
that complicated. It's always simple.</i>

1373
01:41:16,739 --> 01:41:18,198
<i>You know what I'm getting at,
Verbal. The truth!</i>

1374
01:41:18,282 --> 01:41:21,034
<i>There's no mystery to the street,
no arch-criminal behind it all.</i>

1375
01:41:21,118 --> 01:41:24,079
<i>Somebody with power, somebody
who's capable of tracking us...</i>

1376
01:41:24,163 --> 01:41:26,582
<i>Keyser Soze!
- It's Keyser Soze.</i>

1377
01:41:26,665 --> 01:41:30,002
<i>You think a guy like that
comes this close to getting caught</i>

1378
01:41:30,085 --> 01:41:31,754
<i>and sticks his head out?</i>

1379
01:41:31,837 --> 01:41:32,838
<i>Keyser...</i>

1380
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:35,716
<i>Because you're stupid, Verbal.
Because you're a cripple.</i>

1381
01:41:35,799 --> 01:41:37,092
<i>What I wanna know is,
who's the gimp?</i>

1382
01:41:37,176 --> 01:41:39,553
<i>You've known,
you've known the whole fucking time.</i>

1383
01:41:39,636 --> 01:41:40,679
<i>How do I know that?</i>

1384
01:41:40,721 --> 01:41:42,598
<i>If he comes up for anything,
it'll be to get rid of me.</i>

1385
01:41:42,681 --> 01:41:44,016
<i>I'm sure Keaton is dead.</i>

1386
01:41:44,099 --> 01:41:47,352
<i>I can't feel my legs, Keyser.</i>

1387
01:41:47,394 --> 01:41:49,855
<i>First thing I learned on the job,
you know what it was?</i>

1388
01:41:49,938 --> 01:41:51,231
<i>How to spot a murderer.</i>

1389
01:41:51,315 --> 01:41:53,025
<i>They tell me you got the cripple
in there from New York</i>

1390
01:41:53,066 --> 01:41:55,068
<i>- Yeah.
- Did he mention Keyser Soze?</i>

1391
01:41:55,152 --> 01:41:56,487
<i>Who?</i>

1392
01:41:56,528 --> 01:41:58,071
<i>After that,</i>

1393
01:41:58,530 --> 01:42:01,533
<i>my guess is
you'll never hear from him again.</i>

1394
01:42:21,887 --> 01:42:24,473
<i>The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled</i>

1395
01:42:24,556 --> 01:42:27,267
<i>was convincing the world he didn't exist.</i>

1396
01:42:29,394 --> 01:42:30,395
<i>And like that,</i>

1397
01:42:32,022 --> 01:42:33,065
<i>he's gone.</i>
