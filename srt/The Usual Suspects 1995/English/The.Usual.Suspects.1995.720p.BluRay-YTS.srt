00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,333
How you doing, Keaton?

2
00:03:39,962 --> 00:03:42,381
I can't feel my legs...

3
00:03:44,383 --> 00:03:45,926
...Keyser.

4
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,348
Ready?

5
00:04:03,027 --> 00:04:04,320
What time is it?

6
00:04:05,738 --> 00:04:06,947
12:30.

7
00:05:12,554 --> 00:05:15,224
It all started back in New York
six weeks ago.

8
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:18,936
A truck loaded with gun parts
got jacked outside of Queens.

9
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,438
The driver saw nobody,
but someone fucked up.

10
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:24,358
He heard a voice.
Sometimes that's all you need.

11
00:05:27,903 --> 00:05:28,946
Mr. McManus?

12
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:32,199
Christ! Don't you fucking guys
ever sleep?

13
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:35,661
- We have a warrant for your arrest.
- Fuck you, pig.

14
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,795
Todd Hockney?

15
00:05:45,337 --> 00:05:48,340
- Who wants to know?
- New York Police Department.

16
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:53,762
Shit!

17
00:05:54,013 --> 00:05:56,056
- Freeze!
- Hold it!

18
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:03,147
You sure you brought enough guys?

19
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:39,892
It's quite simple.

20
00:06:40,142 --> 00:06:44,897
A restaurant that changes with the
taste without losing the esthetic.

21
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:49,652
In other words, the atmosphere
will not be painted on the walls.

22
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:52,488
Let me give you an example.

23
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,657
This I had to see for myself.

24
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:58,243
David.

25
00:06:59,703 --> 00:07:01,747
- I'm in a meeting.
- Time for another one.

26
00:07:02,831 --> 00:07:05,292
Everyone, this is David Kujan.

27
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:08,420
Special Agent Kujan, U.S. Customs.

28
00:07:08,754 --> 00:07:11,548
These men are from
the New York Police Department.

29
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:15,094
You look good, Keaton.
Better than I'd have thought.

30
00:07:15,344 --> 00:07:16,595
You have a problem?

31
00:07:16,887 --> 00:07:20,516
A small matter of a stolen truck
loaded with guns.

32
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,270
Mr. Keaton?

33
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,772
Will you excuse us for a moment?

34
00:07:29,108 --> 00:07:32,611
We have some questions to ask you
downtown. You'll be a while.

35
00:07:33,445 --> 00:07:36,657
No, no, no, please.
Please, sit down.

36
00:07:38,033 --> 00:07:40,035
This is a small problem.

37
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:41,412
Enjoy the meal.

38
00:07:41,704 --> 00:07:43,247
Talk to you later.

39
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,771
<i>It didn't make sense</i>
<i>that I'd be there.</i>

40
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:10,774
<i>These guys were hard-core hijackers.</i>

41
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:13,068
<i>But there I was.</i>

42
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,239
<i>At that point, I wasn't scared.</i>

43
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:20,576
<i>I knew I hadn't done anything</i>
<i>they could do me for.</i>

44
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:23,203
<i>Besides, it was fun.</i>

45
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:25,998
<i>I got to make like I was notorious.</i>

46
00:08:26,957 --> 00:08:28,334
<i>You all know the drill.</i>

47
00:08:28,626 --> 00:08:33,339
<i>When your number is called,</i>
<i>repeat the phrase you've been given.</i>

48
00:08:33,631 --> 00:08:36,008
<i>Number one, step forward.</i>

49
00:08:40,262 --> 00:08:43,307
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

50
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:47,478
<i>Number two, step forward.</i>

51
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:53,442
Give me the fucking keys,
you cocksucker, motherfucker...

52
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:57,363
Knock it off. Get back.
Number three, step forward.

53
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,625
- Hand me the keys, you cocksucker.
- <i>In English, please.</i>

54
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,085
Excuse me?

55
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:13,337
<i>In English.</i>

56
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:16,465
Hand me the keys, you cocksucker.
What the fuck?

57
00:09:16,715 --> 00:09:18,592
<i>Number four, step forward.</i>

58
00:09:18,884 --> 00:09:21,679
<i>It was bullshit.</i>
<i>The whole rap was a setup.</i>

59
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:25,015
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

60
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:26,684
<i>It was the cops' fault.</i>

61
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:29,853
<i>You don't put guys like that</i>
<i>into a room together.</i>

62
00:09:30,145 --> 00:09:32,106
<i>Who knows what can happen.</i>

63
00:09:32,398 --> 00:09:36,277
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

64
00:09:36,568 --> 00:09:39,655
This has really gotta be
embarrassing for you guys.

65
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:44,451
<i>Someone was pissed about that</i>
<i>hijacked truck. The cops had nothing.</i>

66
00:09:44,702 --> 00:09:47,746
<i>They hoped somebody would slip</i>
<i>and give them something.</i>

67
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:51,917
<i>They knew we wouldn't fight it</i>
<i>because they knew how to lean on us.</i>

68
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:55,879
<i>Our rights went out the window.</i>
<i>It was a violation. Disgraceful.</i>

69
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,716
<i>They went after McManus first.</i>
<i>Topnotch entry man.</i>

70
00:09:59,008 --> 00:10:00,467
What truck?

71
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:04,263
- The truck with the guns, fucko.
- Fucko?

72
00:10:07,224 --> 00:10:09,435
<i>He was a good guy. Crazy though.</i>

73
00:10:09,727 --> 00:10:11,437
Wanna know what Fenster told us?

74
00:10:11,687 --> 00:10:15,107
- Said who?
- McManus. He told us another story.

75
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:18,861
Was that the one about
the hooker with the dysentery?

76
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:21,947
<i>Fenster worked with McManus.</i>
<i>He was a tight-ass.</i>

77
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:25,492
<i>But when it came to the job,</i>
<i>he was right on. A smart man.</i>

78
00:10:25,743 --> 00:10:26,869
What are you saying?

79
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:30,289
- I said he'll flip you.
- He'll what?

80
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:32,207
- Flip you for real.
- I'm shaking.

81
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,501
Come on. Answer my question.

82
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:36,337
Can you hear me in the back?

83
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,175
I want my lawyer.

84
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:44,178
I'm gonna have your fucking badge,
cocksucker.

85
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,222
<i>Todd Hockney. Good with explosives.</i>

86
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:50,976
<i>Without a doubt, the guy who</i>
<i>didn't give a fuck about anybody.</i>

87
00:10:51,268 --> 00:10:53,437
You guys don't have a leg to stand on.

88
00:10:53,729 --> 00:10:57,399
I can put you in Queens
on the night of the hijacking.

89
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,859
Really?

90
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:02,947
I live in Queens. Did you put that
together yourself, Einstein?

91
00:11:03,238 --> 00:11:05,449
You got a team of monkeys
working on this?

92
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:08,869
You know what happens if you do
another turn in the joint?

93
00:11:10,955 --> 00:11:13,040
Fuck your father
and then have a snack.

94
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,627
- You gonna charge me?
- I'll charge you when I'm ready.

95
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,338
- With what?
- You know damn well, dead man.

96
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,259
<i>But Keaton? He was the real prize</i>
<i>for them, for obvious reasons.</i>

97
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,928
It was your mistake. Not mine.

98
00:11:28,806 --> 00:11:31,183
Did you ever stop to ask me?

99
00:11:32,434 --> 00:11:36,814
I mean, I been walking around
with the same face, the same name.

100
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,149
I'm a businessman.

101
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:41,443
What's that?
The restaurant business?

102
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:45,364
From now on, you're in the
getting-fucked-by-us business.

103
00:11:45,656 --> 00:11:47,992
I'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker.

104
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:49,952
Like I said...

105
00:11:50,202 --> 00:11:53,372
...it was your mistake. Not mine.

106
00:11:54,206 --> 00:11:57,042
Now, you charge me with this shit...

107
00:11:57,668 --> 00:11:59,336
...and I'll beat it.

108
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,800
Let's get back to the truck, asshole.

109
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,265
Somebody's gotta do something.
I get hauled in every five minutes.

110
00:12:11,557 --> 00:12:14,602
So I did a little time.
Does that mean I get railed...

111
00:12:14,852 --> 00:12:19,356
...every time a truck finds its way
off the planet? Fuck them.

112
00:12:19,607 --> 00:12:23,694
Fenster, will you relax? These guys
don't have any probable cause.

113
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,030
You're fucking-A right. No P.C.

114
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,408
You're goddamn right.
You do some time, never let you go.

115
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,579
They treat me like a criminal,
I'll end up a criminal.

116
00:12:33,871 --> 00:12:35,247
You are a criminal.

117
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,586
Now, why you gotta go and do that?
I'm trying to make a point.

118
00:12:40,836 --> 00:12:45,466
Why don't you make your point?
You're making me tired all over.

119
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:46,884
Fuck it, then.

120
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:49,261
- I heard you were dead.
- Oh, yeah?

121
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:52,765
- You heard right.
- Word I got is you hung up your spurs.

122
00:12:53,265 --> 00:12:55,893
- What's that all about?
- What's this?

123
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,395
Rumor is Keaton's gone straight.

124
00:12:59,188 --> 00:13:02,316
- I hear he's tapping Edie Finneran.
- Who's that?

125
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:06,654
A heavyweight criminal lawyer.
I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.

126
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,989
How about it, Keaton?

127
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:11,075
You a lawyer's wife?

128
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,577
What retainer you giving her?

129
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:18,791
Hey, Fenster, do your friend a favor.

130
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,585
Tell him to keep quiet.

131
00:13:22,461 --> 00:13:24,421
Dean Keaton.

132
00:13:25,547 --> 00:13:26,966
Gone clean, huh?

133
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:29,260
Say it ain't so.

134
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,136
Or did you hit that truck?

135
00:13:31,428 --> 00:13:35,057
Mac, Mac. Forget him.
Did you get to talk to your lawyer?

136
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:38,018
This whole thing was a shakedown.

137
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:41,730
- Why do you say that?
- How many times you been in a lineup?

138
00:13:42,773 --> 00:13:44,858
It's always you and four dummies.

139
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:48,362
P.D. pays homeless guys
10 bucks a head half the time.

140
00:13:48,737 --> 00:13:51,865
There's no way they'd line
five felons in the same row.

141
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:55,536
A voice lineup? A public defender
could get you out of that.

142
00:13:55,828 --> 00:13:57,538
So why was I strip-searched?

143
00:13:57,788 --> 00:13:59,415
It was the feds.

144
00:13:59,665 --> 00:14:01,750
A truckload of guns get snagged.

145
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:05,879
Customs comes down on NYPD
for answers. They come up with us.

146
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,258
- They're clutching at straws.
- A guy's finger was up my ass.

147
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,676
Is it Friday already?

148
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:14,013
Yeah, lover-boy.

149
00:14:14,263 --> 00:14:16,974
You want a piece?
Jump in. I'll love you.

150
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:20,728
So who are the goddamn pigs
who stole our fucking truck?

151
00:14:22,021 --> 00:14:25,024
- What did you say?
- Who stole the fucking truck?

152
00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:28,235
- I don't want to know.
- Who asked you, working man?

153
00:14:28,485 --> 00:14:30,779
Fuck who did it.
I wanna know, who's the gimp?

154
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:34,825
- He's okay.
- Says you. What about it, pretzel man?

155
00:14:35,451 --> 00:14:36,910
His name is Verbal.

156
00:14:37,703 --> 00:14:39,496
Verbal Kint.

157
00:14:40,664 --> 00:14:43,834
Roger, really.
People say I talk too much.

158
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,878
I was gonna tell you to shut up.

159
00:14:46,128 --> 00:14:47,880
We met before once or twice.

160
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,506
In county. I was in for fraud.

161
00:14:49,757 --> 00:14:51,926
You were in a lineup. What happened?

162
00:14:52,217 --> 00:14:54,970
I walked. 90 days suspended.

163
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:56,388
So you did it.

164
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,474
All right, now look.

165
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:02,227
We've all been put out
by this whole thing, right?

166
00:15:02,478 --> 00:15:06,190
So I figure we owe it to ourselves
to salvage a little dignity.

167
00:15:06,732 --> 00:15:09,944
Now, me and Fenster heard
about a little job.

168
00:15:10,235 --> 00:15:11,904
Why don't you just calm down?

169
00:15:12,363 --> 00:15:14,114
What do you care what he says?

170
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:17,076
I'm just talking here.

171
00:15:17,701 --> 00:15:22,790
It seems to me like Mr. Hockney wants
to hear it, and I know Fenster's down.

172
00:15:23,707 --> 00:15:25,376
What about you, guy?

173
00:15:26,752 --> 00:15:28,128
I'm interested. Sure.

174
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,673
There. See?

175
00:15:30,923 --> 00:15:33,968
Now I'd like to exercise
my right to free assembly.

176
00:15:34,218 --> 00:15:36,053
Why don't you just shut up?

177
00:15:42,184 --> 00:15:43,644
You're missing the point.

178
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:47,815
No. You're missing the point.

179
00:15:48,732 --> 00:15:51,151
I don't wanna hear anything from you.

180
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:53,779
I don't care about your job.

181
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:01,245
I want nothing to do with any of you.

182
00:16:01,578 --> 00:16:05,165
I beg your pardon,
but you can all go to hell.

183
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:09,044
Dean Keaton...

184
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:11,380
...gone the high road.

185
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,217
What is the world coming to?

186
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,098
Fuck him.

187
00:16:25,936 --> 00:16:27,563
<i>And that was how it started.</i>

188
00:16:27,813 --> 00:16:32,318
<i>Us five being brought in on trumped-up</i>
<i>charges to be leaned on by half-wits.</i>

189
00:16:35,237 --> 00:16:37,573
I really can't
talk about it much here.

190
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:41,285
<i>What the cops never figured out,</i>
<i>and what I know now...</i>

191
00:16:41,535 --> 00:16:44,830
<i>...was that these men would</i>
<i>never break. Never lie down.</i>

192
00:16:45,748 --> 00:16:47,791
<i>Never bend over for anybody.</i>

193
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:50,252
<i>Anybody.</i>

194
00:17:06,018 --> 00:17:07,061
Who are you?

195
00:17:07,353 --> 00:17:10,314
Agent Jack Baer, FBI. How many dead?

196
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:13,817
Fifteen. They're still pulling
bodies out of the water.

197
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:16,570
- Any survivors?
- There's two.

198
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,156
One guy's in County Hospital
in a coma.

199
00:17:19,448 --> 00:17:22,493
The D.A. has the second guy,
a cripple from New York.

200
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:24,870
The chief wants this place sealed off.

201
00:17:25,162 --> 00:17:27,581
If you have any questions,
give him a call.

202
00:18:02,116 --> 00:18:05,327
<i>This is Dave Kujan.</i>
<i>I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.</i>

203
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:07,663
<i>If you need me, contact Jeff Rabin...</i>

204
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:12,543
<i>...of the San Pedro Police Department</i>
<i>at extension 112. Have a nice day.</i>

205
00:18:17,006 --> 00:18:18,924
- Why can't I see him?
- I told you.

206
00:18:19,174 --> 00:18:23,387
The D.A. was here ready to arraign
even before they moved him to county.

207
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,432
Kint's lawyer shows up
five minutes later...

208
00:18:26,724 --> 00:18:29,935
...the D.A. comes out looking like
the bogeyman smacked him.

209
00:18:30,185 --> 00:18:33,272
They take his statement,
and they cut him a deal.

210
00:18:33,522 --> 00:18:35,983
- Did they charge him with anything?
- Weapons.

211
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:37,484
Misdemeanor two.

212
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:39,111
What is that?

213
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,282
I give the D.A. credit for getting
that much. You understand?

214
00:18:43,574 --> 00:18:45,159
Excuse me, sir.

215
00:18:46,285 --> 00:18:48,329
This thing has turned political.

216
00:18:48,579 --> 00:18:51,040
The mayor was here last night,
the chief.

217
00:18:51,332 --> 00:18:53,334
This morning, the governor called.

218
00:18:53,626 --> 00:18:55,794
This guy is protected
from up on high...

219
00:18:56,086 --> 00:18:58,923
...by the Prince of Darkness.
Take my word for it.

220
00:18:59,173 --> 00:19:01,467
- When does he post bail?
- Two hours, tops.

221
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,302
- I wanna see him.
- No, David.

222
00:19:03,594 --> 00:19:05,387
I gotta see him, Jeffrey.

223
00:19:05,638 --> 00:19:08,807
You gotta do this for me.
I came a long way for this.

224
00:19:10,434 --> 00:19:12,061
Dave, please.

225
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:18,233
Even if I let you talk to him,
he won't talk.

226
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:24,198
He's paranoid about being recorded.
He knows interrogation rooms are wired.

227
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:27,368
This won't be an interrogation.
Just a friendly chat.

228
00:19:27,618 --> 00:19:29,495
He won't go to
the interrogation room.

229
00:19:29,745 --> 00:19:31,872
- Then someplace else, then.
- Where?

230
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:38,837
If this was a dope deal, where is it?
If it was a hit, who called it in?

231
00:19:39,088 --> 00:19:42,841
I'm sure you have wild theories
to answer all these questions.

232
00:19:43,092 --> 00:19:45,928
- You know what I think.
- That's crazy.

233
00:19:46,178 --> 00:19:48,931
He's got total immunity.
His story checks out.

234
00:19:49,181 --> 00:19:53,435
- He doesn't know what you wanna know.
- I don't think he does. Not exactly.

235
00:19:53,686 --> 00:19:56,522
There's a lot more to his story,
believe me.

236
00:19:56,772 --> 00:20:00,234
I wanna know why 27 men died
on that pier...

237
00:20:00,526 --> 00:20:04,822
...for what looks to be $91 million
worth of dope that wasn't there.

238
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:08,492
And above all, I wanna be sure
Dean Keaton's dead.

239
00:20:08,993 --> 00:20:10,202
He's dead.

240
00:20:10,661 --> 00:20:13,581
Come on. Two hours.
Just till he makes bail.

241
00:20:14,206 --> 00:20:17,585
They're all dead. I don't care
how tough a guy Keaton was.

242
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:20,754
Nobody on that boat could've
come out alive.

243
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:27,761
- Is he talking?
- He regained consciousness and spoke.

244
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:30,472
- Not English. Then he lapsed.
- Hungarian?

245
00:20:30,723 --> 00:20:33,434
- I think so.
- Most of them were Hungarians.

246
00:20:33,726 --> 00:20:37,354
- Put on one of these.
- Burn victims are subject to infection.

247
00:20:38,314 --> 00:20:40,899
And of course, there's no smoking.

248
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:52,995
Keep your mask up.
Don't touch him.

249
00:20:53,245 --> 00:20:54,163
Is he gonna die?

250
00:20:54,455 --> 00:20:56,874
He has burns over 60% of his body.

251
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,668
Get a man on the door
till police get here.

252
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,003
Is he dangerous?

253
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:04,506
Yes. Do it. Do it now.

254
00:21:08,552 --> 00:21:10,763
Joel? Yeah. Baer.
Down at L.A. County.

255
00:21:11,055 --> 00:21:15,059
Look, the guy they pulled out
of the harbor is Arkosh Kovash.

256
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:19,688
No, he's all fucked up.

257
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:22,608
I can't hear you.

258
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:25,444
Will you shut up? I'm on the phone.

259
00:21:30,115 --> 00:21:31,659
Send me a Hungarian.

260
00:21:32,493 --> 00:21:34,286
He's talking like a Thai hooker.

261
00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:39,792
Keyser Soze!

262
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:46,215
No shit.

263
00:21:47,883 --> 00:21:50,761
Joel, call Dan Metzheiser
over at Justice...

264
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:53,681
...and find Dave Kujan from Customs.

265
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:30,593
Verbal, this is Agent Kujan
from Customs.

266
00:22:31,343 --> 00:22:32,928
Nice to meet you.

267
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,849
- He wants to ask you a few questions.
- What about?

268
00:22:37,099 --> 00:22:38,934
About Dean Keaton, mostly.

269
00:22:40,311 --> 00:22:42,479
But I'd like to start at the lineup.

270
00:22:42,771 --> 00:22:46,066
- Can I get some coffee?
- Let's talk about the lineup.

271
00:22:46,317 --> 00:22:49,612
I'm really thirsty.
I used to dehydrate as a kid.

272
00:22:49,903 --> 00:22:52,948
One time I got so bad
my piss come out like snot.

273
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,825
I'll get your coffee.

274
00:22:55,117 --> 00:22:57,077
Get me one too while you're at it.

275
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,876
That guy is tense.

276
00:23:04,126 --> 00:23:05,586
Tension is a killer.

277
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,672
I used to be in a quartet
in Skokie, Illinois.

278
00:23:08,964 --> 00:23:12,718
The baritone was Kip Diskin.
Big, fat guy. I mean, orca fat.

279
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,386
He was so stressed...

280
00:23:14,678 --> 00:23:16,513
You know we're trying to help you.

281
00:23:16,805 --> 00:23:18,599
Sure. And I appreciate that.

282
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:21,727
And I wanna help you, Agent Kujan.
I like cops.

283
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:24,521
I would've liked to have been
a fed but...

284
00:23:24,772 --> 00:23:28,567
You're not telling us everything.
I know you know something.

285
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:31,070
<i>I told the D.A. everything I know.</i>

286
00:23:32,655 --> 00:23:37,576
<i>Verbal, I know you like Keaton.</i>
<i>I know you think he's a good man.</i>

287
00:23:37,868 --> 00:23:40,579
- <i>I know he was good.</i>
- <i>He was a corrupt cop.</i>

288
00:23:40,871 --> 00:23:43,624
<i>Sure, 15 years ago.</i>
<i>But he was a good thief.</i>

289
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:46,252
The cops wouldn't let him go legit.

290
00:23:46,502 --> 00:23:48,796
Dean Keaton was a piece of shit.

291
00:23:51,548 --> 00:23:54,426
Are you trying to get a rise
out of me, Agent Kujan?

292
00:23:55,094 --> 00:23:56,637
I just wanna hear your story.

293
00:23:56,887 --> 00:23:58,180
It's all there.

294
00:23:59,098 --> 00:24:00,683
May I have a cigarette?

295
00:24:03,894 --> 00:24:05,771
- According to...
- I need a light.

296
00:24:10,192 --> 00:24:13,112
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator.

297
00:24:19,368 --> 00:24:21,996
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator.

298
00:24:23,831 --> 00:24:25,291
Run-of-the-mill scams.

299
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:27,710
That's been suppressed.
It's inadmissible.

300
00:24:28,002 --> 00:24:29,044
I know.

301
00:24:29,336 --> 00:24:31,380
Sweet deal you have.
Total immunity.

302
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:35,551
Well, I do have the weapons charge.

303
00:24:35,843 --> 00:24:38,012
I'm looking at six whole months
hard time.

304
00:24:38,304 --> 00:24:40,180
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer?

305
00:24:41,682 --> 00:24:43,684
You know a religious guy
named John Paul?

306
00:24:43,934 --> 00:24:45,144
Ruby's in Attica.

307
00:24:45,394 --> 00:24:47,730
- He didn't have my lawyer.
- I know Ruby.

308
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,358
He's big on respect.
He's a good friend of mine.

309
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:53,402
I know your testimony's sealed.

310
00:24:53,652 --> 00:24:57,114
Ruby's got friends inside
who do a lot of favors for him.

311
00:24:57,406 --> 00:25:01,243
What would he say if he found out you
dropped his name to the D.A.?

312
00:25:01,493 --> 00:25:04,830
- There's nothing about Ruby.
- I'll mention that to him.

313
00:25:05,122 --> 00:25:07,875
First thing on the job,
I learned to spot a murderer.

314
00:25:08,167 --> 00:25:11,921
You arrest three guys for a killing.
You put them in jail overnight.

315
00:25:12,212 --> 00:25:14,298
Next day, whoever's sleeping
is your man.

316
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:17,968
If you're guilty, you know you're
caught. You let your guard down.

317
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,596
- You following me?
- No.

318
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:22,848
Let me get to the point.

319
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:25,434
I'm smarter than you.

320
00:25:26,101 --> 00:25:28,562
And I'll find out
what I wanna know.

321
00:25:28,812 --> 00:25:30,648
And I'm gonna get it from you.

322
00:25:31,815 --> 00:25:33,692
I'm not a rat.

323
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,991
Thanks.

324
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:48,749
When I picked beans in Guatemala,
we made fresh coffee.

325
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:50,584
Right off the trees, I mean.

326
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:51,961
That was good.

327
00:25:52,253 --> 00:25:54,129
This is shit, but I'm at a police...

328
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,839
Can we get started again?

329
00:25:56,131 --> 00:25:58,717
Now, what happened after the lineup?

330
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,101
The sergeant told me
he couldn't release you.

331
00:26:07,393 --> 00:26:10,229
Can you believe that?
You weren't even charged.

332
00:26:10,521 --> 00:26:12,064
Police!

333
00:26:14,817 --> 00:26:18,988
I wanna take pictures of your face.
I'll take them to the D.A.'s office.

334
00:26:19,238 --> 00:26:20,239
Forget about it.

335
00:26:20,489 --> 00:26:22,908
I'll have this at the grand jury
by Monday.

336
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,160
I don't wanna talk about it, Edie.

337
00:26:28,163 --> 00:26:29,957
What did Fortier and Renault say?

338
00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:32,751
They asked for some more time.

339
00:26:33,002 --> 00:26:34,587
They just want more time.

340
00:26:34,837 --> 00:26:36,046
More time for what?

341
00:26:36,547 --> 00:26:39,925
No matter how you cover me,
they'll still find out about me.

342
00:26:40,426 --> 00:26:42,219
Give me some credit.

343
00:26:42,553 --> 00:26:43,554
I got you this far.

344
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:46,432
Let's go to the grand jury.
This won't stop...

345
00:26:46,682 --> 00:26:48,976
It's never gonna stop, period.

346
00:26:49,518 --> 00:26:53,355
By next week, every investor is
gonna be walking away from us.

347
00:26:55,107 --> 00:26:56,525
It's finished.

348
00:26:56,817 --> 00:26:58,569
I'm finished.

349
00:27:04,033 --> 00:27:06,493
Don't give up on me now, Dean.

350
00:27:08,245 --> 00:27:10,456
It's never gonna stop.

351
00:27:17,546 --> 00:27:19,006
I love you.

352
00:27:19,882 --> 00:27:22,676
They ruined me in there tonight.

353
00:27:24,261 --> 00:27:25,804
I love you.

354
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:28,390
Do you hear me?

355
00:27:35,522 --> 00:27:36,649
What?

356
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,530
Let's just go to my place.

357
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:00,881
We'll worry about this tomorrow.

358
00:28:05,511 --> 00:28:06,679
Let's go.

359
00:28:09,098 --> 00:28:11,600
<i>Fenster and McManus had</i>
<i>a cagey proposition.</i>

360
00:28:11,892 --> 00:28:14,645
<i>A fast jump. High risk, long money.</i>

361
00:28:14,937 --> 00:28:16,522
<i>We all knew it could be done.</i>

362
00:28:16,814 --> 00:28:19,441
<i>I figured to do it wrong</i>
<i>meant killing.</i>

363
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:21,944
<i>To do it right took five men.</i>

364
00:28:22,236 --> 00:28:24,196
<i>Five men meant Keaton.</i>

365
00:28:25,406 --> 00:28:27,658
<i>Keaton took convincing.</i>

366
00:28:29,868 --> 00:28:32,121
New York's Finest Taxi Service.

367
00:28:32,871 --> 00:28:34,248
Bullshit.

368
00:28:34,957 --> 00:28:36,500
Bullshit.

369
00:28:37,543 --> 00:28:39,461
They don't operate anymore.

370
00:28:39,753 --> 00:28:43,799
McManus has a friend in the 14th
precinct. They're doing one job.

371
00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:46,427
They're picking up a guy
smuggling emeralds.

372
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:49,638
- McManus already has a fence set.
- A fence? Who?

373
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,183
- Some guy in California. Redfoot.
- I never heard of him.

374
00:28:53,475 --> 00:28:54,560
You have to come.

375
00:28:54,852 --> 00:28:59,273
- What's it to you whether I do or not?
- They don't know me. You do.

376
00:28:59,565 --> 00:29:01,734
They won't take me unless you go.

377
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:04,862
- Look at me. I need this.
- Tough.

378
00:29:05,112 --> 00:29:08,616
You're telling me you don't need this?
Is this your place?

379
00:29:08,907 --> 00:29:12,786
You look like you got a good
little scam going with this lawyer.

380
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:18,250
Sorry.

381
00:29:19,043 --> 00:29:20,502
It's okay.

382
00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:24,673
You say it's the real thing.
That's cool.

383
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:28,844
You okay?

384
00:29:29,178 --> 00:29:30,721
I was out of line.

385
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,308
But they'll never stop with us.
You know that.

386
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,019
As clean as you get,
they won't let you go.

387
00:29:37,311 --> 00:29:41,357
This way, we hit the cops where it
hurts, and we get well in the meantime.

388
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:47,196
You're sure you're okay?

389
00:29:47,613 --> 00:29:49,031
I'll be all right.

390
00:30:05,673 --> 00:30:07,841
- I sometimes get...
- Forget it.

391
00:30:11,428 --> 00:30:13,681
I'll probably shit blood tonight.

392
00:30:28,696 --> 00:30:30,364
How do they wanna do it?

393
00:30:32,074 --> 00:30:35,202
McManus wants to go in shooting.
I say no.

394
00:30:36,453 --> 00:30:38,497
Fenster? Hockney?

395
00:30:38,747 --> 00:30:41,417
They're pretty pissed off.
They'll do anything.

396
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:44,670
I got a way to do it
without killing anyone...

397
00:30:44,962 --> 00:30:47,256
...but they won't let me in
without you.

398
00:31:05,482 --> 00:31:07,067
Three million?

399
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:10,404
Maybe more.

400
00:31:14,825 --> 00:31:16,243
No killing?

401
00:31:17,912 --> 00:31:20,205
Not if we do it my way.

402
00:31:53,697 --> 00:31:56,867
<i>New York's Finest Taxi Service</i>
<i>wasn't a normal taxi.</i>

403
00:31:57,117 --> 00:32:01,163
<i>It was a ring of corrupt cops</i>
<i>that ran a high-profit racket...</i>

404
00:32:01,413 --> 00:32:03,540

<i>around the city.</i>

405

<i>For a few hundred dollars a mile,</i>
<i>you got a police escort.</i>

406
00:32:07,544 --> 00:32:09,213
<i>They even had business cards.</i>

407
00:32:09,463 --> 00:32:13,425
<i>Somebody started asking questions,</i>
<i>and the Taxi Service shut down.</i>

408

<i>That's where we came in.</i>

410
00:32:19,348 --> 00:32:22,393
- So how was the flight?
- Fucking great.

411
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,522
Will this get me to Staten Island?

412
00:32:27,523 --> 00:32:30,150
You kidding me? This'll get you
to Cape Cod.

413
00:32:30,401 --> 00:32:33,320
<i>McManus came to us with the job.</i>
<i>Fenster got the vans.</i>

414
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,863
<i>Hockney, the hardware.</i>

415
00:32:35,114 --> 00:32:37,533

419
00:32:50,796 --> 00:32:51,922
Careful, careful!

Don't move, you fuckers!

423
00:32:59,138 --> 00:33:00,598
Drop it now, motherfucker.

424
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:03,225
Drop the fucking gun. Drop it.

Do it! Give him the money!
Give him the money!

00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:34,001
Cool it.

467
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,129
L.A.'s a good place to lay low
for a while.

468
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,383
You wanna dance?

469
00:35:48,933 --> 00:35:50,267
Ladies.

470
00:35:58,108 --> 00:35:59,902
I'd like to propose a toast.

471
00:36:01,362 --> 00:36:02,988
There you go.

472
00:36:05,407 --> 00:36:07,159
To Mr. Verbal...

473
00:36:08,661 --> 00:36:10,704
...the man with the plan.

474
00:36:23,926 --> 00:36:25,427
<i>We'll miss the flight.</i>

475
00:36:26,553 --> 00:36:29,473
Don't do this.
Send her a note, something.

476
00:36:30,349 --> 00:36:32,184
I said we'll make it.

477
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,845
We're gonna miss the plane.

478
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,390
She'll understand.

479
00:37:30,618 --> 00:37:32,161
That's heartwarming.

480
00:37:32,453 --> 00:37:33,704
Really.

481
00:37:35,205 --> 00:37:36,624
I'm weepy.

482
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:39,752
Jeff, you wanna wait outside?

483
00:37:43,088 --> 00:37:45,925
You wanted to know
what happened after the lineup.

484
00:37:46,216 --> 00:37:47,593
Come on, Verbal.

485
00:37:47,885 --> 00:37:49,970
Who do you think you're talking to?

486
00:37:50,304 --> 00:37:53,098
Do you expect me to believe
that he retired?

487
00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:55,184
For a woman?

488
00:37:56,977 --> 00:37:59,897
Bullshit. Keaton was using her.

489
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:02,358
- He loved her.
- Sure.

490
00:38:02,608 --> 00:38:05,527
<i>Hitting the Taxi Service</i>
<i>wasn't his idea?</i>

491
00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:07,321
<i>It was Fenster and McManus.</i>

492
00:38:07,613 --> 00:38:11,450
<i>Keaton was a cop for four years.</i>
<i>Who knew the Taxi Service better?</i>

493
00:38:11,742 --> 00:38:14,620
- <i>That job was his.</i>
- <i>But Edie had him turned around.</i>

494
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,664
Let me tell you something.

495
00:38:16,914 --> 00:38:18,332
I know Dean Keaton.

496
00:38:18,582 --> 00:38:21,168
I've been investigating him
for three years.

497
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,171
The guy I knew was
a cold-blooded bastard.

498
00:38:24,505 --> 00:38:28,550
I.A. indicted him on 3 counts of murder
before he was kicked off the force.

499
00:38:28,801 --> 00:38:30,719
He's not the hooker
with the heart of gold.

500
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:32,680
You got him all wrong.

501
00:38:33,847 --> 00:38:35,015
Do I?

502
00:38:35,516 --> 00:38:39,770
Dean Keaton was under indictment
seven times while he was on the force.

503
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,482
In every case, witnesses
either reversed their testimony...

504
00:38:43,983 --> 00:38:46,485
...or died before they could testify.

505
00:38:47,152 --> 00:38:48,988
They finally nailed him
for fraud.

506
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,659
He spent five years in Sing Sing.
He killed three prisoners inside.

507
00:38:54,118 --> 00:38:56,912
Of course, I can't prove this.

508
00:38:57,663 --> 00:39:00,249
But I can't prove
the best part either.

509
00:39:01,584 --> 00:39:05,671
Dean Keaton was dead.
Did you know that?

510
00:39:05,963 --> 00:39:07,798
He died in a fire two years ago...

511
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:12,845
...during a murder investigation of a
witness who would testify against him.

512
00:39:13,095 --> 00:39:17,975
Two people saw Dean Keaton walk into
a warehouse just before it blew up.

513
00:39:18,267 --> 00:39:21,520
They said he went in to check
a leaking gas main.

514
00:39:22,062 --> 00:39:25,941
It blew up and took
all of Dean Keaton with it.

515
00:39:26,734 --> 00:39:28,861
Within three months
of the explosion...

516
00:39:29,153 --> 00:39:31,530
...the two witnesses, they were dead.

517
00:39:31,822 --> 00:39:33,824
One killed himself in his car...

518
00:39:34,074 --> 00:39:37,161
...the other fell down
an open elevator shaft.

519
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:41,957
Let's get this show on the road.

520
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:44,251
There are far too many people...

521
00:39:44,543 --> 00:39:47,379
We'll be out of here
before he blows his porch light.

522
00:39:47,671 --> 00:39:50,007
- I have a noon meeting.
- Five minutes.

523
00:39:50,299 --> 00:39:52,009
Everyone just calm down.

524
00:39:52,301 --> 00:39:55,888
I want you to ask this man
about the shootout in the harbor.

525
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:10,778
- He says they were buying...
- Dope. We know.

526
00:40:16,492 --> 00:40:20,454
He doesn't know what they were buying,
but not dope. People.

527
00:40:20,704 --> 00:40:21,789
What?

528
00:40:29,421 --> 00:40:31,173
He needs guarantees...

529
00:40:31,423 --> 00:40:34,718
- What's he talking about?
- He says his life is in danger.

530
00:40:36,095 --> 00:40:39,431
He saw the devil,
looked him in the eye.

531
00:40:39,723 --> 00:40:42,059
- I'm on my way.
- No, no, wait a minute.

532
00:40:42,351 --> 00:40:45,187
Ask him to tell him what he told me.

533
00:40:45,646 --> 00:40:47,231
About the devil.

534
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,108
Who's the devil?

535
00:40:54,572 --> 00:40:56,490
Keyser Soze.

536
00:41:00,911 --> 00:41:02,037
Keyser Soze?

537
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:05,749
He was in the harbor killing many men.

538
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,294
He saw Keyser Soze?

539
00:41:14,216 --> 00:41:15,217
He saw his face.

540
00:41:15,509 --> 00:41:19,763
All right, look. Tell him
to tell her what he looks like.

541
00:41:20,014 --> 00:41:21,432
Describe him.

542
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:31,567
<i>Six weeks ago, I get a call</i>
<i>saying I can find Keaton...</i>

543
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:34,820
<i>...eating at Mondino's</i>
<i>with his attorney. There he is.</i>

544
00:41:35,446 --> 00:41:38,365
Because he never profited
from his alleged death...

545
00:41:38,657 --> 00:41:42,077
...and we convicted someone else
of the murder...

546
00:41:42,328 --> 00:41:43,954
...we had to let him go.

547
00:41:44,914 --> 00:41:47,917
He was dead long enough
for the murder rap to blow over.

548
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:49,793
And then he had lunch.

549
00:41:50,294 --> 00:41:51,921
I don't know about that.

550
00:41:52,212 --> 00:41:53,964
I don't think you do.

551
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:56,675
But you say you saw Keaton die.

552
00:41:56,967 --> 00:41:59,595
You're covering him,
and he's still out there.

553
00:41:59,887 --> 00:42:01,889
He's behind the circus
at the harbor.

554
00:42:02,181 --> 00:42:05,559
He's using your stupidity.
You think he's your friend.

555
00:42:05,851 --> 00:42:08,354
You tell me he's dead, so be it.

556
00:42:09,104 --> 00:42:11,190
I wanna be sure he's dead.

557
00:42:11,482 --> 00:42:14,193
He wasn't behind anything.
It was the lawyer.

558
00:42:14,944 --> 00:42:16,278
What lawyer?

559
00:42:17,154 --> 00:42:17,947
What lawyer?

560
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,116
When I was in that quartet
in Skokie, Illinois...

561
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:23,410
I know you held out on the D.A.!

562
00:42:23,702 --> 00:42:27,373
What did you leave out of that
testimony? I can phone Ruby Deemer.

563
00:42:27,665 --> 00:42:30,376
- The D.A. gave me immunity.
- Not from me.

564
00:42:30,668 --> 00:42:32,920
You get no immunity from me.

565
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:36,423
Every criminal I've put in prison
or cop who owes me...

566
00:42:36,674 --> 00:42:40,511
...every creep that works the street
will know the name of Verbal Kint.

567
00:42:40,803 --> 00:42:44,348
You talk to me or that immunity
they deem so fit to grant you...

568
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,394
...won't be worth the paper the
contract on your life is printed on.

569
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,773
There was a lawyer.

570
00:42:54,024 --> 00:42:55,693
Kobayashi.

571
00:42:56,527 --> 00:42:58,654
- Was he the one that killed Keaton?
- No.

572
00:42:58,946 --> 00:43:01,532
But I'm sure Keaton is dead.

573
00:43:01,824 --> 00:43:03,409
Convince me.

574
00:43:03,867 --> 00:43:06,120
And tell me every last detail.

575
00:43:25,514 --> 00:43:29,476
<i>We arrived in Los Angeles and met</i>
<i>McManus' fence, Redfoot.</i>

576
00:43:29,935 --> 00:43:33,355
<i>He had a good reputation.</i>
<i>Seemed like a good guy.</i>

577
00:43:33,647 --> 00:43:35,566
<i>Still, we should've known better.</i>

578
00:43:35,858 --> 00:43:36,650
How you doing?

579
00:43:36,984 --> 00:43:40,362
- Good. You?
- Not bad. Can't complain.

580
00:43:40,738 --> 00:43:42,406
How's it going, Fenster?

581
00:43:43,574 --> 00:43:45,326
No need to open it, right?

582
00:43:51,624 --> 00:43:53,250
You must be Keaton.

583
00:43:54,293 --> 00:43:56,128
Redfoot, Dean Keaton.

584
00:43:56,378 --> 00:44:00,549
- Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint.
- Verbal, the man with a plan, huh?

585
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,718
Interested in any more work?

586
00:44:03,802 --> 00:44:06,513
- We're always looking for work.
- We're on vacation.

587
00:44:06,805 --> 00:44:09,224
Oh, well. That's too bad.

588
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,227
I got a ton of work
and no good people.

589
00:44:12,728 --> 00:44:14,480
- Not like you guys.
- What's the job?

590
00:44:14,813 --> 00:44:17,608
There's this jeweler out of Texas
named Saul.

591
00:44:17,858 --> 00:44:19,902
He rents a suite
in a downtown hotel.

592
00:44:20,152 --> 00:44:23,614
He does appraisals. Sometimes
he buys, sometimes he doesn't.

593
00:44:23,864 --> 00:44:26,492
The word is, he carries around
a lot of cash.

594
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:31,288
So I figure I keep the merchandise,
you keep the green.

595
00:44:31,705 --> 00:44:33,832
- It's simple.
- What about security?

596
00:44:34,124 --> 00:44:37,044
A couple of bodyguards.
Nothing you couldn't handle.

597
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:39,546
Give me time to check it out?

598
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:42,049
I expect nothing less from you, man.

599
00:44:43,384 --> 00:44:45,261
Good to see you. We'll call you.

600
00:44:45,678 --> 00:44:48,514
Enjoy L.A. Get yourself laid.

601
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:57,273
A friend of mine in New York tells me
that you knew Spook Hollis.

602
00:44:58,232 --> 00:45:01,235
The way I hear it,
you did time with old Spook.

603
00:45:01,527 --> 00:45:03,112
Good man, wasn't he?

604
00:45:03,737 --> 00:45:05,823
I used to run dope for him.

605
00:45:06,323 --> 00:45:08,117
Too bad he got shivved.

606
00:45:10,744 --> 00:45:11,745
I shivved him.

607
00:45:14,248 --> 00:45:17,710
Better you hear it from me now,
than from somebody else later.

608
00:45:19,253 --> 00:45:20,879
I appreciate that.

609
00:45:22,423 --> 00:45:23,841
Just out of curiosity...

610
00:45:24,383 --> 00:45:27,511
...was it business or personal?

611
00:45:29,513 --> 00:45:30,389
A bit of both.

612
00:45:32,433 --> 00:45:34,184
Like I said...

613
00:45:34,643 --> 00:45:36,895
...give me a call
if you're interested.

614
00:45:41,567 --> 00:45:43,152
Is there a problem?

615
00:45:44,945 --> 00:45:46,405
One job.

616
00:45:46,655 --> 00:45:48,365
That was the deal.

617
00:45:53,495 --> 00:45:55,039
One job?

618
00:45:57,791 --> 00:45:59,418
One job!

619
00:46:00,753 --> 00:46:02,755
That's a good one, Keaton.

620
00:46:04,965 --> 00:46:08,427
<i>Keaton fought it,</i>
<i>but a man can't change what he is.</i>

621
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:11,597
<i>He can convince anyone he's</i>
<i>someone else, but never himself.</i>

622
00:46:11,847 --> 00:46:15,476
<i>It took one day with McManus nagging,</i>
<i>and we went back to work.</i>

623
00:46:30,157 --> 00:46:32,409
I get out of my car
and it's wrecked.

624
00:46:32,743 --> 00:46:35,955
I look in the back seat of the car,
and this woman is naked.

625
00:46:36,247 --> 00:46:37,998
I'm laughing so hard!

626
00:46:38,249 --> 00:46:39,375
Get in the car, Saul.

627
00:46:39,667 --> 00:46:42,211
Freeze, motherfucker!
Right there!

628
00:46:42,461 --> 00:46:43,837
Here we go.

629
00:46:49,927 --> 00:46:53,222
Give me the case.
Give me the fucking case!

630
00:46:59,395 --> 00:47:00,771
Give me the fucking case.

631
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:04,817
I'm telling you for the last time,
give me the fucking case!

632
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:11,532
Come on! Hey, don't move.

633
00:47:47,234 --> 00:47:49,028
Just hand over the case.

634
00:47:50,029 --> 00:47:52,239
Hand over the fucking case.

635
00:48:16,055 --> 00:48:17,681
Come on, let's go!

636
00:48:18,515 --> 00:48:21,685
- Come on!
- Bad day. Fuck it.

637
00:48:21,936 --> 00:48:23,312
Let's go, let's go!

638
00:48:47,378 --> 00:48:48,837
Fuck!

639
00:48:51,548 --> 00:48:55,219
Looks like a lot of China to me.
Shit.

640
00:49:00,641 --> 00:49:02,518
Guys, come on.

641
00:49:03,686 --> 00:49:05,896
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna kill him.

642
00:49:06,188 --> 00:49:07,773
We're gonna do it my way.

643
00:49:08,023 --> 00:49:10,234
- You gonna kill him?
- I'll deal with him.

644
00:49:10,526 --> 00:49:13,779
- You better deal with him.
- I'll deal with him. Shut up.

645
00:49:20,536 --> 00:49:21,954
What do I do with that?

646
00:49:23,497 --> 00:49:26,292
I don't know. Feed it to the gimp.
Ease his pain.

647
00:49:26,584 --> 00:49:28,877
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

648
00:49:29,461 --> 00:49:32,047
- I got thrown this job by some lawyer.
- Who?

649
00:49:32,298 --> 00:49:34,258
I don't know. Some limey.

650
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:37,803
He's a middleman for someone.
He doesn't say, I don't ask.

651
00:49:38,095 --> 00:49:40,514
- You're fucking full of shit.
- Fuck you.

652
00:49:40,848 --> 00:49:43,601
Listen to me. We wanna meet him.

653
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,520
That's funny.

654
00:49:47,062 --> 00:49:49,690
He called me.
Says he wants to meet you guys.

655
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:54,028
- We'll meet him.
- I'll call.

656
00:49:54,278 --> 00:49:57,781
- Good. Do that. No problem.
- I don't like it. Wait a minute.

657
00:49:58,032 --> 00:49:59,199
One more thing...

658
00:49:59,742 --> 00:50:02,369
...any more surprises,
and I'm gonna kill you.

659
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:05,497
You're such a tough guy.

660
00:50:05,748 --> 00:50:09,668
Do me a favor, all right?
Get the fuck off my dick.

661
00:50:11,921 --> 00:50:13,923
Better put a leash on that puppy.

662
00:50:15,966 --> 00:50:19,637
You know, it's an awful shame
about Saul getting whacked.

663
00:50:19,887 --> 00:50:22,806
Cops will be looking
for the guys who did it.

664
00:50:23,307 --> 00:50:25,768
Sooner or later,
they'll come asking me.

665
00:50:28,187 --> 00:50:30,314
You have a sweet night, ladies.

666
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:35,736
Fuck you.

667
00:50:41,909 --> 00:50:43,035
So this lawyer...

668
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,912
Kobayashi.

669
00:50:45,537 --> 00:50:47,957
...came from Redfoot.
- Right.

670
00:50:48,249 --> 00:50:50,751
Why leave this out
when you talked to the D.A.?

671
00:50:51,043 --> 00:50:53,254
Dave, someone to see you.

672
00:50:56,507 --> 00:50:57,841
Jack.

673
00:50:58,884 --> 00:51:00,552
I been looking all over for you.

674
00:51:00,886 --> 00:51:04,223
You still after that coke
that took a walk from the bloodbath?

675
00:51:04,515 --> 00:51:07,226
Well, you can stop looking.
There was no coke.

676
00:51:07,518 --> 00:51:12,606
I been talking to a guy they pulled
out of a drainpipe after the shootout.

677
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,775
He came to. He started talking.

678
00:51:15,067 --> 00:51:18,988
He's part of a Hungarian mob dealing
with some goats from Argentina.

679
00:51:19,238 --> 00:51:22,116
- He says it wasn't a dope deal.
- But the 91 million...

680
00:51:22,366 --> 00:51:24,159
Our man says no way on the dope.

681
00:51:24,451 --> 00:51:28,122
He tells me the bunch was pulling
stumps for Turkey the next day.

682
00:51:28,372 --> 00:51:31,667
They had no time to negotiate,
no means to move it.

683
00:51:31,959 --> 00:51:33,877
- What's the money for?
- He didn't know.

684
00:51:34,128 --> 00:51:36,839
No one doing the deal knew,
except a few people.

685
00:51:37,131 --> 00:51:39,383
They were very hush about it,
he says.

686
00:51:39,675 --> 00:51:42,219
Whatever it was,
it was very sensitive.

687
00:51:42,469 --> 00:51:43,721
I don't get it.

688
00:51:44,013 --> 00:51:46,223
You got the cripple in there
from New York.

689
00:51:46,515 --> 00:51:48,684
- Did he mention Keyser Soze?
- Who?

690
00:51:49,977 --> 00:51:51,854
Just bear with me here.

691
00:51:53,439 --> 00:51:55,024
Who's Keyser Soze?

692
00:51:55,316 --> 00:51:56,567
Fuck!

693
00:51:57,151 --> 00:52:00,613
We've been going over this
for an hour and a half.

694
00:52:00,905 --> 00:52:04,491
What we need to do is find Redfoot
and get out of here now.

695
00:52:04,783 --> 00:52:07,077
What we need to do is think.

696
00:52:07,369 --> 00:52:08,537
Think back.

697
00:52:09,496 --> 00:52:12,291
Somebody with power...

698
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:15,753
...who was capable of tracking us
from New York to L.A.

699
00:52:16,045 --> 00:52:19,340
- What the hell are we doing here?
- We're waiting.

700
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,883
Sit down.

701
00:52:21,175 --> 00:52:23,344
No. It's hot, and I'm fucking bored.

702
00:52:23,636 --> 00:52:25,846
Mr. Hockney, do stay.

703
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,514
Mr. Keaton.

704
00:52:27,973 --> 00:52:32,019
Mr. Fenster, I recognize from
his mug shots, as well as Mr. McManus.

705
00:52:32,311 --> 00:52:34,396
I can only assume
that you are Mr. Kint...

706
00:52:34,688 --> 00:52:37,107
...the gentleman who disposed
of Saul Berg.

707
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:41,737
My employer sends his gratitude.
A most unexpected benefit.

708
00:52:42,238 --> 00:52:43,822
I am Mr. Kobayashi.

709
00:52:44,114 --> 00:52:48,702
I have been asked by my employer
to bring a proposal to you gentlemen.

710
00:52:48,994 --> 00:52:52,081
- What do you want?
- My employer requires your services.

711
00:52:54,208 --> 00:52:55,292
One job.

712
00:52:55,584 --> 00:52:57,670
One day's work. Very dangerous.

713
00:52:57,962 --> 00:53:01,382
He doesn't expect all of you to live,
but those who do...

714
00:53:01,632 --> 00:53:05,469
...will have $91 million to divide
between you in any way you see fit.

715
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:06,595
Who's your boss?

716
00:53:09,515 --> 00:53:11,267
I work for Keyser Soze.

717
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:23,445
Who's Keyser Soze?

718
00:53:23,737 --> 00:53:28,617
Judging by the sudden change in mood,
I'm sure your associates can tell you.

719
00:53:29,535 --> 00:53:32,413
I come with an offer
directly from Mr. Soze.

720
00:53:32,705 --> 00:53:34,039
An order, actually.

721
00:53:34,331 --> 00:53:36,417
What do you mean, "an order"?

722
00:53:36,667 --> 00:53:38,961
In 1981, Mr. Keaton,
you participated...

723
00:53:39,211 --> 00:53:42,006
...in the hijacking of a truck
in Buffalo, New York.

724
00:53:42,256 --> 00:53:45,551
The cargo was raw steel.
Steel which belonged to Mr. Soze...

725
00:53:45,843 --> 00:53:49,888
...and which was destined for Pakistan
to be used in a nuclear reactor.

726
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:53,058
A most profitable violation
of UN regulations.

727
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:55,352
You had no way of knowing this.

728
00:53:55,603 --> 00:53:58,606
The man shipping the steel
was working for Mr. Soze...

729
00:53:58,856 --> 00:54:00,316
...without his knowledge.

730
00:54:00,608 --> 00:54:03,152
Earlier this year,
Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus...

731
00:54:03,444 --> 00:54:06,989
...hijacked a two-prop cargo flight
out of Newark airport.

732
00:54:07,281 --> 00:54:11,619
The plane was carrying gold and
platinum wiring, also set for Pakistan.

733
00:54:12,202 --> 00:54:13,454
Two months ago...

734
00:54:13,746 --> 00:54:18,042
...Mr. Hockney stole a truck
carrying gun parts through Queens.

735
00:54:18,334 --> 00:54:21,837
Gun parts which were set to be
destroyed by the state of New York.

736
00:54:22,129 --> 00:54:25,758
They were to be lost in a way station
and re-routed to Belfast.

737
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:29,053
Again, Mr. Soze using pawns
who had no knowledge.

738
00:54:29,303 --> 00:54:31,889
Which brings us to Mr. Kint.

739
00:54:32,723 --> 00:54:36,810
Nine months ago, one of Mr. Soze's
less-than-intelligent couriers...

740
00:54:37,061 --> 00:54:41,565
...was taken in a complicated
confidence scam by a cripple.

741
00:54:42,483 --> 00:54:45,402
He was relieved of $62,000.

742
00:54:45,653 --> 00:54:48,697
Now, it has taken us some time
to find you.

743
00:54:48,948 --> 00:54:52,701
Our intention was to approach you
after your apprehension in New York.

744
00:54:52,952 --> 00:54:54,119
You set up the lineup.

745
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:57,289
You were not to be released
until I had come to see you.

746
00:54:57,581 --> 00:55:00,626
It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney,
Miss Finneran...

747
00:55:00,876 --> 00:55:02,920
...was a little too effective...

748
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:06,757
...in expediting his release. Holding
the rest was a moot point.

749
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:09,885
- What about Redfoot?
- Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.

750
00:55:10,135 --> 00:55:12,471
Mr. Soze rarely works with
the same people.

751
00:55:12,763 --> 00:55:14,515
They never know
who they work for.

752
00:55:15,474 --> 00:55:18,936
One cannot be betrayed
if one has no people.

753
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:21,730
So why are you telling us?

754
00:55:21,981 --> 00:55:26,819
Because you have stolen from Mr. Soze,
Mr. Fenster. All of you.

755
00:55:27,153 --> 00:55:30,948
That you did not know you did
is the only reason you're still alive.

756
00:55:31,407 --> 00:55:32,867
He feels you owe him.

757
00:55:33,159 --> 00:55:35,202
You will repay your debt.

758
00:55:35,578 --> 00:55:39,415
Fuck the debt and fuck you.
How do we know you work for Soze?

759
00:55:39,874 --> 00:55:42,543
I don't think that is very relevant,
Mr. Hockney.

760
00:55:42,793 --> 00:55:47,381
You all are responsible for the murder
of Saul Berg and his bodyguards.

761
00:55:47,631 --> 00:55:51,761
Mr. Redfoot can testify to your
involvement. We can see that he will.

762
00:55:52,053 --> 00:55:53,220
What's your point?

763
00:55:53,512 --> 00:55:55,222
The offer is this, gentlemen.

764
00:55:55,473 --> 00:55:59,268
Mr. Soze's primary interest
is narcotics.

765
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,396
He has been competing,
shall we say...

766
00:56:02,646 --> 00:56:04,690
...with Argentineans
for years now.

767
00:56:04,982 --> 00:56:08,194
Competing with Mr. Soze has
taken its toll.

768
00:56:08,694 --> 00:56:12,073
These Argentineans are negotiating
the sale...

769
00:56:12,323 --> 00:56:15,284
...of $91 million in cocaine
in three days' time.

770
00:56:15,576 --> 00:56:18,329
Needless to say,
this purchase will revitalize...

771
00:56:18,621 --> 00:56:21,749
...the diminishing strength
of their organization.

772
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:25,544
Mr. Soze would like you
to stop the deal.

773
00:56:26,462 --> 00:56:29,048
If you choose, you may wait
until after the buy.

774
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,967
Whatever money changes hands is yours.

775
00:56:32,802 --> 00:56:37,807
Mr. Soze would like you to get to the
boat and destroy the cocaine onboard.

776
00:56:38,265 --> 00:56:43,020
And then you will be free
of your obligations to Mr. Soze.

777
00:56:44,522 --> 00:56:48,442
You give me one good reason why
I shouldn't kill you right now.

778
00:56:50,027 --> 00:56:52,488
A gift from Mr. Soze.

779
00:56:55,866 --> 00:56:57,660
Good day, gentlemen.

780
00:58:06,937 --> 00:58:10,149
They got my whole life in here.
Everything I've ever done.

781
00:58:10,483 --> 00:58:12,026
They know everything.

782
00:58:12,693 --> 00:58:15,488
Everybody I've ever worked with
or did time with.

783
00:58:33,339 --> 00:58:35,299
- This isn't right.
- I don't know.

784
00:58:35,549 --> 00:58:38,552
Who's that guy used to talk about Soze
in New York?

785
00:58:40,304 --> 00:58:41,389
Bricks Marlin.

786
00:58:41,681 --> 00:58:44,725
Yeah, he did jobs for him.
Indirect stuff.

787
00:58:45,017 --> 00:58:47,895
He made five times more money
than it was worth.

788
00:58:49,438 --> 00:58:53,484
This guy's a pipe dream. Kobayashi's
using him for window-dressing.

789
00:58:53,901 --> 00:58:55,653
I don't know. This is bad.

790
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:59,949
No, it's bullshit. This guy
could be LAPD. It's a fucking setup.

791
00:59:00,741 --> 00:59:03,744
The way I hear it,
Soze's some kind of a butcher.

792
00:59:03,995 --> 00:59:06,122
A peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher.

793
00:59:06,414 --> 00:59:08,332
There is no Keyser Soze!

794
00:59:11,085 --> 00:59:13,170
Who is Keyser Soze?

795
00:59:13,838 --> 00:59:15,256
He's supposed to be Turkish.

796
00:59:15,548 --> 00:59:17,508
Some say his father was German.

797
00:59:17,758 --> 00:59:19,802
Nobody ever believed he was real.

798
00:59:20,052 --> 00:59:23,097
Nobody knew him or saw anybody
that worked directly for him.

799
00:59:23,347 --> 00:59:26,100
To hear Kobayashi tell it,
anybody could've worked for him.

800
00:59:26,392 --> 00:59:29,395
You never knew. That was his power.

801
00:59:30,312 --> 00:59:33,482
The greatest trick
the devil ever pulled...

802
00:59:33,774 --> 00:59:36,902
...was convincing the world
he didn't exist.

803
00:59:38,237 --> 00:59:40,698
One story the guys told me,
the story I believe...

804
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:42,533
...was from his days in Turkey.

805
00:59:42,783 --> 00:59:45,286
A gang of Hungarians
wanted their own mob.

806
00:59:45,578 --> 00:59:47,371
They realized that to be in power...

807
00:59:47,621 --> 00:59:50,374
...you didn't need guns or money
or even numbers.

808
00:59:50,666 --> 00:59:54,253
You just needed the will to do
what the other guy wouldn't.

809
00:59:54,545 --> 00:59:57,631
After a while, they come into power.
They went after Soze.

810
00:59:57,882 --> 01:00:01,093
He was smalltime then.
Just running dope, they say.

811
01:00:03,888 --> 01:00:06,515
They come to his home
in the afternoon...

812
01:00:06,807 --> 01:00:08,267
<i>...looking for his business.</i>

813
01:00:08,517 --> 01:00:11,771
<i>They find his wife and kids</i>
<i>and decide to wait for Soze.</i>

814
01:00:27,995 --> 01:00:29,080
<i>He comes home...</i>

815
01:00:29,372 --> 01:00:32,208
<i>...to find his wife raped</i>
<i>and children screaming.</i>

816
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:36,003
<i>The Hungarians knew Soze was tough,</i>
<i>not to be trifled with.</i>

817
01:00:36,253 --> 01:00:38,631
So they let him know
they meant business.

818
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:46,847
<i>They tell him they want his</i>
<i>territory, all his business.</i>

819
01:00:47,098 --> 01:00:51,143
Soze looks over the faces
of his family.

820
01:00:52,395 --> 01:00:56,148
Then he showed these men of will
what will really was.

821
01:01:15,376 --> 01:01:18,796
<i>He tells them he would rather</i>
<i>see his family dead...</i>

822
01:01:19,046 --> 01:01:21,382
<i>...than live another day after this.</i>

823
01:01:22,508 --> 01:01:24,760
<i>He lets the last Hungarian go.</i>

824
01:01:25,052 --> 01:01:28,931
He waits until his family is
in the ground, then goes after the mob.

825
01:01:29,223 --> 01:01:31,809
He kills their kids.
He kills their wives.

826
01:01:32,059 --> 01:01:34,395
He kills their parents,
their parents' friends.

827
01:01:34,937 --> 01:01:37,189
<i>He burns down the houses</i>
<i>they live in...</i>

828
01:01:38,149 --> 01:01:39,775
<i>...the stores they work in.</i>

829
01:01:40,359 --> 01:01:42,445
<i>He kills people that owe them money.</i>

830
01:01:42,737 --> 01:01:43,904
<i>And like that...</i>

831
01:01:45,281 --> 01:01:46,198
...he's gone.

832
01:01:46,449 --> 01:01:48,451
Underground.
Nobody's ever seen him since.

833
01:01:48,701 --> 01:01:52,872
He becomes a myth. A spook story that
criminals tell their kids at night.

834
01:01:53,122 --> 01:01:56,334
"Rat on your pop,
and Keyser Soze will get you."

835
01:01:57,126 --> 01:01:59,045
And no one ever really believes.

836
01:01:59,337 --> 01:02:01,213
Do you believe in him, Verbal?

837
01:02:03,924 --> 01:02:05,593
Keaton always said:

838
01:02:05,843 --> 01:02:09,347
"I don't believe in God
but I'm afraid of him."

839
01:02:11,265 --> 01:02:13,309
Well, I believe in God.

840
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:15,728
And the only thing that scares me...

841
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:17,897
...is Keyser Soze.

842
01:02:24,779 --> 01:02:26,489
Do you give any weight to this?

843
01:02:26,781 --> 01:02:30,743
I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser.
He's got a file on Soze in D.C.

844
01:02:31,035 --> 01:02:32,703
It's a hobby of his.

845
01:02:32,995 --> 01:02:36,666
A lot of guys equate him to that
reporter on <i>The Incredible Hulk</i>.

846
01:02:41,671 --> 01:02:44,382
- You've heard of him?
- Where? On the street?

847
01:02:44,674 --> 01:02:47,343
Yeah, a few times. Outside stuff.

848
01:02:47,635 --> 01:02:50,262
Somebody worked for a guy
who got some money...

849
01:02:50,554 --> 01:02:53,140
...from Keyser Soze.
You know, shit like that.

850
01:02:54,266 --> 01:02:56,394
It could be an old badge.
A hex sign...

851
01:02:56,686 --> 01:02:59,230
...to keep people from fucking with you.

852
01:02:59,522 --> 01:03:01,565
- But you're here.
- Well, shit, yeah.

853
01:03:01,857 --> 01:03:06,070
A guy left a hospital on a fried
drumstick because he's afraid of Soze.

854
01:03:06,404 --> 01:03:08,364
I'll run it up the flagpole.

855
01:03:10,491 --> 01:03:14,120
I came clean. So what if I left out
how I got on the boat.

856
01:03:14,412 --> 01:03:18,374
It's so full of holes, the D.A. would've
told me to blow amnesty out my ass.

857
01:03:18,666 --> 01:03:19,667
Big fucking deal.

858
01:03:19,959 --> 01:03:21,335
That's why you never told the D.A.?

859
01:03:21,585 --> 01:03:22,837
You tell me, Agent Kujan.

860
01:03:23,087 --> 01:03:26,132
If I said the Loch Ness monster
hired me, what would you say?

861
01:03:26,382 --> 01:03:29,135
Turn state's evidence.
We'll put you on the stand.

862
01:03:29,385 --> 01:03:31,387
I've got immunity.
What can you offer?

863
01:03:31,637 --> 01:03:34,181
If there is a Soze,
he's gonna come for you.

864
01:03:35,516 --> 01:03:37,059
Where's your head?

865
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,771
Where do you think
the pressure's coming from?

866
01:03:41,022 --> 01:03:42,565
Soze knows where I am now.

867
01:03:42,857 --> 01:03:46,652
He's got a burner under you to let
me go, so he can scoop me up later.

868
01:03:46,944 --> 01:03:50,573
Immunity was just a deal with you.
I got a new problem when I post bail.

869
01:03:50,823 --> 01:03:52,783
Why play to him?
We can protect you.

870
01:03:53,617 --> 01:03:54,910
Gee, thanks, Dave.

871
01:03:55,202 --> 01:03:57,955
Bang-up job so far.
Extortion. Coercion.

872
01:03:58,205 --> 01:03:59,707
Pardon me, kiss my pucker.

873
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:04,462
The fuckers that rounded us up and sank
us into this mess are bailing me out?

874
01:04:07,089 --> 01:04:09,467
You think you can catch Keyser Soze?

875
01:04:09,717 --> 01:04:14,013
You think he'd come this close to
getting caught and stick his head out?

876
01:04:14,555 --> 01:04:17,308
If he comes up,
it'll be to get rid of me.

877
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,434
After that...

878
01:04:19,602 --> 01:04:22,396
...my guess is, you'll never
hear from him again.

879
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,170
What happened next?

880
01:04:46,545 --> 01:04:48,798
The next morning Fenster was gone.

881
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:51,676
He couldn't handle the idea
of slumming for Soze.

882
01:04:51,926 --> 01:04:56,389
He left us a note and took a chunk
of the money we'd scraped together.

883
01:04:56,889 --> 01:04:57,973
Then what?

884
01:04:58,265 --> 01:04:59,433
McManus was furious.

885
01:04:59,725 --> 01:05:03,896
He was talking about tracking him down
and ripping his heart out.

886
01:05:04,772 --> 01:05:06,816
That night we got the call.

887
01:05:07,233 --> 01:05:08,317
What call?

888
01:05:08,609 --> 01:05:11,195
Kobayashi told us where
we could find Fenster.

889
01:05:19,036 --> 01:05:21,414
All right.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

890
01:05:23,124 --> 01:05:24,750
We gotta bury him.

891
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:26,419
With what?

892
01:05:26,669 --> 01:05:28,504
With our hands.

893
01:05:37,972 --> 01:05:39,890
This is nuts.

894
01:05:40,141 --> 01:05:41,267
It's dry fucking sand.

895
01:05:41,559 --> 01:05:45,229
When he rots, the surfers
are gonna smell him a mile away.

896
01:05:45,479 --> 01:05:46,272
Fuck!

897
01:05:46,522 --> 01:05:49,108
What are we gonna do?
This guy's gonna kill us.

898
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:53,321
I don't know about you, but
I can run. I got no problem with that.

899
01:05:54,155 --> 01:05:57,283
Kobayashi doesn't seem to have
a problem with it either.

900
01:05:58,242 --> 01:05:59,410
If you run...

901
01:05:59,702 --> 01:06:02,288
...we'll be digging
a hole for you. You got that?

902
01:06:03,164 --> 01:06:05,207
This ain't my boy we're burying.

903
01:06:05,541 --> 01:06:06,792
I don't owe anybody!

904
01:06:07,418 --> 01:06:08,669
So fuck you.

905
01:06:08,961 --> 01:06:11,088
He was my partner for five years.

906
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:14,592
We did more jobs and saw more money
than you can count.

907
01:06:14,842 --> 01:06:16,677
So fuck you!

908
01:06:16,969 --> 01:06:18,304
Because now it's payback.

909
01:06:18,554 --> 01:06:20,222
It's not payback!

910
01:06:23,184 --> 01:06:24,518
It's precaution.

911
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:27,313
You want payback? You wanna run?
I don't care.

912
01:06:30,775 --> 01:06:32,943
I'm not doing this for Fenster.

913
01:06:33,694 --> 01:06:35,655
I'm not doing it for you.

914
01:06:37,198 --> 01:06:38,991
I'm doing this for me.

915
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:42,953
I'm gonna finish this thing.

916
01:06:43,454 --> 01:06:47,124
This Kobayashi bastard
isn't gonna stand on me.

917
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:09,730
After they killed Fenster,
nobody ran?

918
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:12,274
I wanted to.
I thought we could make it.

919
01:07:12,566 --> 01:07:13,901
Why didn't you say anything?

920
01:07:14,151 --> 01:07:18,322
I tried, but Keaton wouldn't have it.
It was too far-fetched for him.

921
01:07:18,614 --> 01:07:21,033
Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop.

922
01:07:21,325 --> 01:07:24,036
To a cop, the explanation
is never that complicated.

923
01:07:24,286 --> 01:07:28,457
There's no mystery to the street.
No archcriminal behind it all.

924
01:07:28,749 --> 01:07:32,086
If you got a body and think
his brother did it, you're right.

925
01:07:32,336 --> 01:07:36,340
Nobody argued with Keaton. They just
set their minds to Kobayashi.

926
01:07:46,892 --> 01:07:48,019
They're coming up.

927
01:07:49,729 --> 01:07:51,981
<i>Did you hear me? He's coming up.</i>

928
01:07:52,231 --> 01:07:53,858
He's on his way down.

929
01:08:50,498 --> 01:08:52,041
Don't move.

930
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:54,543
Press 20. Do it now.

931
01:09:14,689 --> 01:09:16,023
Move!

932
01:09:19,193 --> 01:09:20,611
The answer is no.

933
01:09:20,945 --> 01:09:24,156
- Mr. Soze will be most...
- There is no Keyser Soze.

934
01:09:24,448 --> 01:09:26,242
Mention him again,
I'll kill you.

935
01:09:26,492 --> 01:09:30,871
A strange threat. I can only assume
you've come here to kill me anyway.

936
01:09:36,252 --> 01:09:39,380
Now, we know that you can get to us.

937
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:42,091
But now you know that
we can get to you.

938
01:09:42,967 --> 01:09:45,678
I'm giving you one last chance
to call this off.

939
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:47,221
Mr. S...

940
01:09:47,513 --> 01:09:50,891
My employer has made up his mind.
He does not change it.

941
01:09:51,183 --> 01:09:52,101
Neither do we.

942
01:09:52,768 --> 01:09:55,771
You got Fenster, but you
won't be able to get all of us.

943
01:09:56,022 --> 01:09:57,565
Not before we get to you.

944
01:09:57,857 --> 01:09:59,608
I believe you, Mr. McManus.

945
01:09:59,859 --> 01:10:01,777
I most sincerely do.

946
01:10:02,069 --> 01:10:04,697
You wouldn't be chosen
were you not so suitable.

947
01:10:04,947 --> 01:10:06,949
But I cannot make this decision.

948
01:10:07,241 --> 01:10:11,620
What you threaten me with is ludicrous
compared to what will be done to me...

949
01:10:11,912 --> 01:10:14,832
...if I do not carry out
my orders in full.

950
01:10:22,048 --> 01:10:24,216
I'm the guy that's gonna get you.

951
01:10:26,218 --> 01:10:28,596
I just wanted you to know that.

952
01:10:29,347 --> 01:10:31,557
I'm so sorry, Mr. McManus.

953
01:10:31,849 --> 01:10:34,477
I implore you, Mr. Keaton,
believe me...

954
01:10:34,769 --> 01:10:38,022
...Mr. Soze is very real
and very determined.

955
01:10:38,314 --> 01:10:39,649
We'll see.

956
01:10:47,073 --> 01:10:50,409
Before you do me in, Mr. McManus...

957
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:54,664
...you'll let me finish my business
with Ms. Finneran, won't you?

958
01:10:59,794 --> 01:11:01,337
What did you say?

959
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:03,881
Edie Finneran.

960
01:11:04,173 --> 01:11:06,592
She's upstairs. In my office.

961
01:11:06,884 --> 01:11:09,679
For an extradition deposition.

962
01:11:10,137 --> 01:11:12,556
I requested she be put
on the case personally.

963
01:11:12,807 --> 01:11:14,684
She flew in yesterday.

964
01:11:16,852 --> 01:11:18,229
No matter.

965
01:11:18,646 --> 01:11:20,940
Kill away, Mr. McManus.

966
01:11:25,319 --> 01:11:26,779
You're lying.

967
01:11:27,321 --> 01:11:28,656
Am I?

968
01:11:45,881 --> 01:11:49,468
Ms. Finneran's escort while
she's here in Los Angeles.

969
01:11:49,719 --> 01:11:51,303
Never leaves her side.

970
01:11:51,554 --> 01:11:54,724
I thought you'd be glad to know
she's in good hands.

971
01:11:58,936 --> 01:12:01,772
Get some rest. The boat
will be ready Friday.

972
01:12:02,023 --> 01:12:04,483
If I see you or any of your friends
before then...

973
01:12:04,734 --> 01:12:09,113
...she'll find herself the victim of a
gruesome violation before she dies.

974
01:12:09,363 --> 01:12:11,907
As indeed, will your father,
Mr. Hockney...

975
01:12:12,491 --> 01:12:15,995
...and your Uncle Randall
in Arizona, Mr. Kint.

976
01:12:16,329 --> 01:12:20,583
I might only castrate
Mr. McManus' nephew, David.

977
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:24,628
Do I make myself clear?

978
01:12:25,129 --> 01:12:27,340
Take care of the bodies downstairs.

979
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:30,134
We'll add them to the cost
of Mr. Fenster.

980
01:12:30,718 --> 01:12:32,261
Excuse me, gentlemen.

981
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:13,135
It's a logistical nightmare.

982
01:13:13,427 --> 01:13:16,722
Close quarters.
Ten, maybe 20 men.

983
01:13:17,014 --> 01:13:19,392
No telling how many more
will be below deck.

984
01:13:19,725 --> 01:13:21,686
- Can we stealth these guys?
- No.

985
01:13:22,645 --> 01:13:25,022
With all that coke,
they're gonna be ready.

986
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:29,068
Which brings me
to sunny point number two.

987
01:13:29,527 --> 01:13:32,780
Even if we get through and
jack the boat, we got nothing.

988
01:13:33,072 --> 01:13:34,865
What if we wait for the money?

989
01:13:35,366 --> 01:13:37,535
Ten more men at least.

990
01:13:37,952 --> 01:13:40,997
Look, in my opinion, it can't be done.

991
01:13:41,247 --> 01:13:43,207
Whoever goes there
won't come out alive.

992
01:13:43,457 --> 01:13:44,792
I'm gonna wait for the money.

993
01:13:45,459 --> 01:13:48,462
- Me too.
- Did you hear what he just said?

994
01:13:48,713 --> 01:13:50,798
- If I'm going in, I want a cut.
- Me too.

995
01:13:52,758 --> 01:13:54,802
There's nothing that can't be done.

996
01:13:57,847 --> 01:14:00,558
I can't believe we're
walking into certain death.

997
01:14:07,815 --> 01:14:10,276
The news said
it's raining in New York.

998
01:14:32,006 --> 01:14:33,549
What language is that?

999
01:14:33,841 --> 01:14:35,134
I don't know.

1000
01:14:35,426 --> 01:14:37,595
Russian, I think.

1001
01:14:38,888 --> 01:14:40,514
Hungarian.

1002
01:15:44,453 --> 01:15:47,248
The package has arrived, gentlemen.

1003
01:16:06,976 --> 01:16:07,977
You kids ready?

1004
01:16:08,644 --> 01:16:11,480
I would be if I didn't
have to stop and answer you.

1005
01:16:11,772 --> 01:16:16,027
I'm ready. McManus, you better be
set up in 10 seconds.

1006
01:16:18,237 --> 01:16:19,280
I'm ready.

1007
01:16:20,948 --> 01:16:22,533
I want you to stay here.

1008
01:16:23,909 --> 01:16:25,161
I'm supposed to cover...

1009
01:16:25,411 --> 01:16:28,539
If we don't get out of this,
take the money and go.

1010
01:16:28,789 --> 01:16:33,419
Find Edie. Tell her what happened.
She knows people and knows what to do.

1011
01:16:33,794 --> 01:16:37,506
If I don't get Kobayashi my way,
she'll get him her way.

1012
01:16:37,757 --> 01:16:39,383
Just do what I say.

1013
01:16:40,134 --> 01:16:41,469
Please.

1014
01:16:44,513 --> 01:16:46,057
Tell her that...

1015
01:16:49,727 --> 01:16:51,479
Tell her I tried.

1016
01:17:04,492 --> 01:17:05,409
<i>McManus...</i>

1017
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:07,119
<i>...he's on his way.</i>

1018
01:17:07,453 --> 01:17:08,579
I'm there.

1019
01:18:00,798 --> 01:18:04,677
One, two, three, four...

1020
01:18:04,969 --> 01:18:08,222
...five, six, seven...

1021
01:18:09,348 --> 01:18:11,225
Oswald was a fag.

1022
01:18:21,235 --> 01:18:22,611
How you doing?

1023
01:18:25,614 --> 01:18:28,034
Is there...
Is there a problem?

1024
01:18:53,476 --> 01:18:54,477
Now.

1025
01:19:24,465 --> 01:19:27,468
<i>Old MacDonald had a farm</i>

1026
01:19:28,010 --> 01:19:30,513
<i>E-I-E-I-O</i>

1027
01:19:31,013 --> 01:19:35,559
<i>And on that farm he shot some guys</i>

1028
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:38,270
<i>Bada-boom</i>
<i>Bada-bing-bang-boom</i>

1029
01:20:09,093 --> 01:20:10,636
Elvis has left the building.

1030
01:22:33,779 --> 01:22:35,239
<i>Why didn't you run?</i>

1031
01:22:35,865 --> 01:22:37,241
I froze up.

1032
01:22:38,117 --> 01:22:41,370
I thought about Fenster,
how he looked when we buried him.

1033
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:44,957
I thought about Keaton.
It looked like he might pull it off.

1034
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:56,218
A boy came across a body on the beach
today. Shot twice in the head.

1035
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:58,971
Two guys from the Bureau
just identified him.

1036
01:22:59,221 --> 01:23:02,433
Arturro Marquez.
A petty smuggler from Argentina.

1037
01:23:02,683 --> 01:23:05,394
Arrested last year
in New York for trafficking.

1038
01:23:05,645 --> 01:23:09,148
He escapes to California.
They pick him up in Long Beach.

1039
01:23:09,398 --> 01:23:12,526
They're setting up extradition,
he escapes again.

1040
01:23:12,818 --> 01:23:14,153
Now, get this.

1041
01:23:14,403 --> 01:23:17,740
Edie Finneran's brought in
to advise on the proceedings.

1042
01:23:18,032 --> 01:23:19,158
Kobayashi.

1043
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:22,536
New York faxed me a copy
of his testimony. He was a rat.

1044
01:23:22,828 --> 01:23:23,788
A big rat.

1045
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,791
Arturro was very opposed
to returning to prison.

1046
01:23:27,083 --> 01:23:30,961
So much so that he named
close to 50 people.

1047
01:23:31,253 --> 01:23:33,756
Guess who he named in the finale?

1048
01:23:34,590 --> 01:23:36,050
Keyser Soze.

1049
01:23:36,342 --> 01:23:37,885
There's more.

1050
01:23:49,939 --> 01:23:51,524
I'll tell you what I know.

1051
01:23:51,816 --> 01:23:54,402
Stop me when this sounds familiar.

1052
01:23:55,695 --> 01:23:58,155
There was no dope on that boat.

1053
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:41,157
You, stay quiet.

1054
01:24:41,407 --> 01:24:42,783
He is here.

1055
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,327
I know he is here.

1056
01:24:44,952 --> 01:24:47,121
That's him.
I'm telling you, that's him.

1057
01:24:47,371 --> 01:24:49,248
I know he is here!

1058
01:24:50,416 --> 01:24:53,002
- You can't understand. That's him.
- Shut up!

1059
01:24:53,252 --> 01:24:54,670
That's him! You hear me?

1060
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:58,424
I'm telling you, it's Keyser Soze!

1061
01:26:56,292 --> 01:26:58,002
- Where's Hockney?
- I don't know.

1062
01:26:58,252 --> 01:26:59,795
There's no coke!

1063
01:27:00,755 --> 01:27:03,382
You heard me, you dumb fuck!
There's no coke!

1064
01:27:03,632 --> 01:27:07,136
I've been up and down this ship!
Every fucking room!

1065
01:27:07,428 --> 01:27:09,305
There is nothing!

1066
01:27:09,597 --> 01:27:10,973
Nothing!

1067
01:27:11,265 --> 01:27:12,558
Don't you fuck with me!

1068
01:27:12,850 --> 01:27:16,979
There is no fucking coke!

1069
01:27:27,698 --> 01:27:29,200
I'm out of here.

1070
01:28:10,157 --> 01:28:12,410
I told them nothing.

1071
01:28:13,369 --> 01:28:14,704
I swear.

1072
01:28:15,413 --> 01:28:17,832
I told them nothing. Please.

1073
01:29:04,128 --> 01:29:04,962
McManus.

1074
01:29:05,379 --> 01:29:07,048
What the fuck is going on?

1075
01:29:09,675 --> 01:29:11,635
The strangest thing...

1076
01:30:06,190 --> 01:30:09,235
You say you saw a man in a suit
with a slim build.

1077
01:30:09,527 --> 01:30:11,028
- Wait a minute.
- No.

1078
01:30:11,278 --> 01:30:14,740
You saw Soze? You told the D.A.
you didn't know who it was.

1079
01:30:15,032 --> 01:30:16,742
I know there was dope there.

1080
01:30:16,993 --> 01:30:19,036
You know what I'm getting at!

1081
01:30:19,328 --> 01:30:20,788
Get out of my face.

1082
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:24,000
I've got immunity.
I don't have to take that shit!

1083
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:26,293
You know what I'm getting at.

1084
01:30:26,585 --> 01:30:30,464
The truth! Try to tell me
you saw someone kill Keaton.

1085
01:30:30,756 --> 01:30:32,925
- I did.
- You're lying to me!

1086
01:30:33,175 --> 01:30:35,553
You've known this whole fucking time.

1087
01:30:35,803 --> 01:30:38,848
I don't know what you're saying.
I saw Keaton get shot.

1088
01:30:39,098 --> 01:30:42,018
Then why didn't you help him?
You had a gun.

1089
01:30:42,268 --> 01:30:43,811
He was your friend.

1090
01:30:47,898 --> 01:30:49,859
Because I was afraid.

1091
01:30:50,568 --> 01:30:51,652
Okay?

1092
01:30:51,902 --> 01:30:54,238
- Afraid.
- Afraid of what?

1093
01:30:55,823 --> 01:30:57,742
I knew it was Keyser Soze.

1094
01:30:57,992 --> 01:31:02,163
It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan.
I mean, the devil himself.

1095
01:31:03,247 --> 01:31:05,708
How do you shoot the devil
in the back?

1096
01:31:10,421 --> 01:31:11,964
What if you miss?

1097
01:31:16,802 --> 01:31:19,263
All right.
Let's get back to the pier.

1098
01:32:42,596 --> 01:32:44,181
Ever hear of Arturro Marquez?

1099
01:32:44,473 --> 01:32:45,891
What? No.

1100
01:32:46,142 --> 01:32:48,644
<i>He was a stool pigeon</i>
<i>for the Justice Department.</i>

1101
01:32:48,936 --> 01:32:52,189
He swore out a statement
saying that he had seen...

1102
01:32:52,481 --> 01:32:56,402
...and could positively identify
one Keyser Soze.

1103
01:32:56,652 --> 01:32:57,945
It says right here:

1104
01:32:58,237 --> 01:33:02,408
"He had knowledge of his businesses,
including but not exclusive...

1105
01:33:02,658 --> 01:33:05,870
...to trafficking and murder."
- I never heard of him.

1106
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:08,622
His own people were selling him
to Hungarians.

1107
01:33:08,873 --> 01:33:12,585
<i>Most likely the Hungarians that</i>
<i>Soze all but wiped out in Turkey.</i>

1108
01:33:12,835 --> 01:33:14,128
The money wasn't for dope.

1109
01:33:14,628 --> 01:33:19,133
The Hungarians were buying the one guy
that could incriminate Keyser Soze.

1110
01:33:19,383 --> 01:33:20,593
I never heard of him.

1111
01:33:20,885 --> 01:33:24,764
Keaton did. Edie Finneran
was Marquez's extradition adviser.

1112
01:33:25,014 --> 01:33:26,724
She knew what he knew.

1113
01:33:26,974 --> 01:33:29,727
- I don't...
- There were no drugs on that boat.

1114
01:33:29,977 --> 01:33:33,606
It was a hit. A suicide mission
to whack out the one guy...

1115
01:33:33,856 --> 01:33:35,900
<i>...that could finger Keyser Soze.</i>

1116
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:38,069
<i>Soze put some thieves to it.</i>

1117
01:33:38,444 --> 01:33:40,821
<i>Men he knew he could march</i>
<i>into certain death.</i>

1118
01:33:41,072 --> 01:33:43,699
You're saying Soze
sent us to kill someone?

1119
01:33:44,867 --> 01:33:47,536
<i>Keaton did.</i>
<i>He left you behind for a reason.</i>

1120
01:33:47,828 --> 01:33:49,622
Just do what I tell you.

1121
01:33:49,914 --> 01:33:52,708
If you all knew that Soze
could find you anywhere...

1122
01:33:52,958 --> 01:33:56,879
...why did he give you the money
to run? He could use you on the boat.

1123
01:33:57,129 --> 01:33:58,673
He wanted me to live.

1124
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:04,345
<i>A one-time dirty cop without a</i>
<i>loyalty in the world wants to save...</i>

1125
01:34:04,595 --> 01:34:05,888
<i>...a worthless cripple?</i>

1126
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:07,765
No, sir. Why?

1127
01:34:08,516 --> 01:34:11,936
- Edie.
- I don't buy that reform story.

1128
01:34:12,228 --> 01:34:16,983
Even if I did, I don't believe
he would send you to protect her.

1129
01:34:17,274 --> 01:34:18,818
So why?

1130
01:34:20,987 --> 01:34:22,613
Because he was my friend.

1131
01:34:22,905 --> 01:34:27,159
No, Verbal. He wasn't your friend.
Keaton didn't have friends.

1132
01:34:27,451 --> 01:34:28,244
Why are you here?

1133
01:34:28,494 --> 01:34:32,373
He saved you because he wanted it
that way. It was his will.

1134
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,959
Keaton was Keyser Soze!

1135
01:34:35,835 --> 01:34:39,171
He could wrangle the wills
of men like Hockney and McManus.

1136
01:34:39,422 --> 01:34:44,427
He could engineer a police
lineup through his contacts in NYPD.

1137
01:34:44,677 --> 01:34:47,263
He's a man who could've killed
Edie Finneran!

1138
01:34:52,101 --> 01:34:57,189
She was found yesterday in a hotel in
Pennsylvania, shot twice in the head.

1139
01:35:01,902 --> 01:35:04,280
What do you think about Keaton now?

1140
01:35:05,823 --> 01:35:07,408
Edie?

1141
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:10,911
He used you to get on the boat.
He couldn't get on alone.

1142
01:35:11,162 --> 01:35:14,707
He had to pull the trigger himself
to make sure he got his man.

1143
01:35:14,957 --> 01:35:16,959
The one man that could identify him.

1144
01:35:17,918 --> 01:35:19,754
This is all bullshit.

1145
01:35:20,004 --> 01:35:22,006
You said you saw him die.

1146
01:35:24,592 --> 01:35:25,426
Or did you?

1147
01:35:25,676 --> 01:35:27,803
You hid when you heard the police.

1148
01:35:28,054 --> 01:35:30,681
You said you heard the shot
before the fire.

1149
01:35:30,931 --> 01:35:32,850
But you didn't see him die.

1150
01:35:33,142 --> 01:35:34,477
I knew him. He'd never...

1151
01:35:34,727 --> 01:35:36,145
He programmed you.

1152
01:35:36,395 --> 01:35:40,775
He programmed you to tell us what he
wanted you to. He knew we were close.

1153
01:35:41,025 --> 01:35:44,111
Where was the pressure coming from?
Why were you protected?

1154
01:35:44,362 --> 01:35:47,198
It was Keaton.
Immunity was your reward.

1155
01:35:47,448 --> 01:35:49,116
But why me?

1156
01:35:49,408 --> 01:35:51,827
Why not Fenster, McManus or Hockney?
Why me?

1157
01:35:52,078 --> 01:35:53,954
I'm stupid. I'm a cripple.

1158
01:35:54,246 --> 01:35:55,831
Because you're a cripple.

1159
01:35:56,248 --> 01:35:57,917
Because you're stupid.

1160
01:35:58,209 --> 01:36:00,252
Because you're weaker than them.

1161
01:36:04,423 --> 01:36:05,758
If he's dead...

1162
01:36:06,133 --> 01:36:10,179
...if what you say is true,
then it won't matter.

1163
01:36:11,555 --> 01:36:14,475
It was his idea to hit
the Taxi Service, wasn't it?

1164
01:36:14,725 --> 01:36:17,812
- Come on, tell me the truth.
- It was all Keaton.

1165
01:36:19,021 --> 01:36:22,274
We followed him from the beginning.

1166
01:36:23,401 --> 01:36:24,568
I didn't know.

1167
01:36:25,027 --> 01:36:27,279
I saw him die.

1168
01:36:27,571 --> 01:36:31,325
I believe he's dead. Oh, Christ!

1169
01:36:31,993 --> 01:36:33,703
You're not safe on your own.

1170
01:36:37,832 --> 01:36:39,041
You think he's...

1171
01:36:39,291 --> 01:36:41,043
Keyser Soze?

1172
01:36:41,585 --> 01:36:43,129
I don't know, Verbal.

1173
01:36:44,797 --> 01:36:48,759
Keyser Soze's a shield.
Or like you said, "a spook story."

1174
01:36:49,844 --> 01:36:53,597
But I know Keaton. And someone is
out there pulling strings for you.

1175
01:36:54,223 --> 01:36:57,810
- Stay here and let us protect you.
- I'm not bait. I post today.

1176
01:36:58,060 --> 01:36:59,353
You posted 20 minutes ago.

1177
01:36:59,937 --> 01:37:02,064
Capt. Leo wants you
out of here ASAP.

1178
01:37:02,315 --> 01:37:05,276
- Unless you turn state's.
- I'll take my chances.

1179
01:37:05,526 --> 01:37:09,030
If someone wants to get you,
they're gonna get you out there.

1180
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:12,575
Turn state's evidence.
You might never see trial.

1181
01:37:12,825 --> 01:37:14,410
Maybe so.

1182
01:37:15,745 --> 01:37:18,080
But I'm not a rat, Agent Kujan.

1183
01:37:34,055 --> 01:37:36,307
Fucking cops!

1184
01:38:00,289 --> 01:38:02,917
Excuse me.
Can I use your fax machine?

1185
01:38:06,879 --> 01:38:10,091
You'll have to sign for these,
Mr. Kint.

1186
01:38:11,676 --> 01:38:13,469
One watch, gold.

1187
01:38:13,761 --> 01:38:15,930
One cigarette lighter, gold.

1188
01:38:16,847 --> 01:38:18,849
One pack of cigarettes. Thank you.

1189
01:38:19,392 --> 01:38:21,560
We still got nothing, Dave.

1190
01:38:21,936 --> 01:38:23,938
I know what I wanted
to know about Keaton.

1191
01:38:24,188 --> 01:38:25,731
Which is nothing.

1192
01:38:26,273 --> 01:38:27,400
No matter.

1193
01:38:27,733 --> 01:38:29,777
He'll have to know how close we came.

1194
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:32,989
<i>Keyser Soze or no Keyser Soze...</i>

1195
01:38:33,239 --> 01:38:36,367
<i>...if Keaton is alive,</i>
<i>he's not coming up again.</i>

1196
01:38:36,659 --> 01:38:38,035
<i>I'll find him.</i>

1197
01:38:38,995 --> 01:38:40,538
<i>Waste of time.</i>

1198
01:38:43,082 --> 01:38:45,751
<i>A rumor's not a rumor</i>
<i>that doesn't die.</i>

1199
01:38:46,168 --> 01:38:47,378
<i>What?</i>

1200
01:38:48,295 --> 01:38:49,213
<i>Nothing.</i>

1201
01:38:51,257 --> 01:38:52,717
Man, you're a slob.

1202
01:38:52,967 --> 01:38:56,095
Yeah, but it all has a system, Dave.

1203
01:38:56,387 --> 01:39:00,558
It don't make sense when you look right
at it. You gotta stand back from it.

1204
01:39:01,892 --> 01:39:05,354
Wanna see a real horror show?
You should see my garage.

1205
01:39:42,558 --> 01:39:43,809
<i>Convince me.</i>

1206
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:47,021
<i>When I was in that quartet</i>
<i>in Skokie...</i>

1207
01:39:47,271 --> 01:39:48,814
<i>Where's your head?</i>

1208
01:39:49,065 --> 01:39:51,275
<i>What we need to do is think.</i>
<i>Think back.</i>

1209
01:39:51,525 --> 01:39:53,486
<i>I'm sure you've heard tall tales.</i>

1210
01:39:53,736 --> 01:39:55,863
- <i>This isn't right.</i>
- <i>I just want your story.</i>

1211
01:39:56,113 --> 01:39:58,741
<i>It's all there.</i>
<i>I'm telling it straight, I swear.</i>

1212
01:39:59,033 --> 01:40:00,868
- <i>guy in California</i>
<i>named Redfoot.</i>

1213
01:40:01,118 --> 01:40:02,870
<i>A gift from Mr. Soze.</i>

1214
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:06,707
- <i>What about Redfoot?</i>
- <i>Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.</i>

1215
01:40:06,957 --> 01:40:09,585
<i>Big, fat guy.</i>
<i>I mean, orca fat.</i>

1216
01:40:09,877 --> 01:40:11,962
- <i>There was a lawyer.</i>
- <i>Kobayashi.</i>

1217
01:40:12,213 --> 01:40:13,339
- <i>never see him again.</i>

1218
01:40:13,631 --> 01:40:16,550
- <i>in Guatemala, we made</i>
<i>fresh coffee.</i>

1219
01:40:16,801 --> 01:40:19,679
<i>...- thought he was a good man.</i>
- <i>I know he was good.</i>

1220
01:40:22,098 --> 01:40:23,975
<i>And tell me every last detail.</i>

1221
01:40:24,266 --> 01:40:26,519
<i>How do you shoot the devil</i>
<i>in the back?</i>

1222
01:40:26,769 --> 01:40:30,272
<i>He's protected from up on high</i>

1223
01:40:30,564 --> 01:40:32,191
<i>What about it, pretzel man?</i>

1224
01:40:32,441 --> 01:40:34,318
- <i>There was a lawyer.</i>
- <i>What lawyer?</i>

1225
01:40:34,568 --> 01:40:37,405
- <i>I am Mr. Kobayashi.</i>
- <i>Kobayashi. Kobayashi.</i>

1226
01:40:37,655 --> 01:40:39,031
<i>Tell me every last detail.</i>

1227
01:40:39,281 --> 01:40:42,118
<i>I work for Keyser Soze.</i>

1228
01:40:42,410 --> 01:40:43,577
<i>Convince me.</i>

1229
01:40:57,967 --> 01:41:02,680
<i>Every creep that walks the street</i>
<i>will know the name of Verbal Kint.</i>

1230
01:41:03,306 --> 01:41:06,642
The cripple, did you see him?
Which way did he go?

1231
01:41:06,892 --> 01:41:08,019
He went out that way.

1232
01:41:08,269 --> 01:41:10,479
<i>I know you know something.</i>

1233
01:41:10,771 --> 01:41:14,150
<i>I'm smarter than you.</i>
<i>And I'll find out what I wanna know.</i>

1234
01:41:14,442 --> 01:41:17,820
<i>To a cop, the explanation</i>
<i>is never that complicated.</i>

1235
01:41:18,112 --> 01:41:20,990
<i>There's no mystery to the street.</i>
<i>No archcriminal...</i>

1236
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:25,745
<i>Somebody with power, who was capable</i>
<i>of tracking us from New York to L.A.</i>

1237
01:41:25,995 --> 01:41:29,749
<i>You think he'd come</i>
<i>this close to getting caught...</i>

1238
01:41:30,041 --> 01:41:31,375
<i>...and stick his head out?</i>

1239
01:41:33,127 --> 01:41:35,713
<i>Because you're stupid.</i>
<i>Because you're a cripple.</i>

1240
01:41:38,007 --> 01:41:40,468
<i>You've known the whole fucking time!</i>

1241
01:41:42,928 --> 01:41:43,888
<i>Keaton's dead.</i>

1242
01:41:44,180 --> 01:41:47,266
<i>I can't feel my legs, Keyser.</i>

1243
01:41:47,516 --> 01:41:51,062
<i>First thing I learned on the job</i>
<i>was how to spot a murderer.</i>

1244
01:41:51,354 --> 01:41:54,523
- <i>the cripple from New York,</i>
<i>he mention Keyser Soze?</i>

1245
01:41:55,316 --> 01:41:56,359
<i>Who?</i>

1246
01:41:56,609 --> 01:41:58,027
<i>And after that...</i>

1247
01:41:58,569 --> 01:42:01,364
<i>...my guess is, you'll</i>
<i>never hear from him again.</i>

1248
01:42:22,009 --> 01:42:24,303
<i>The greatest trick</i>
<i>the devil ever pulled...</i>

1249
01:42:24,553 --> 01:42:27,431
<i>...was convincing the world</i>
<i>he didn't exist.</i>

1250
01:42:29,350 --> 01:42:30,393
<i>And like that...</i>

1251
01:42:32,061 --> 01:42:33,479
<i>...he's gone.</i>

1252
01:45:55,097 --> 01:45:56,098
