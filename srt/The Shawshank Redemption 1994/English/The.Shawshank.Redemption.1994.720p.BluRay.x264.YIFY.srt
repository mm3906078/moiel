1
00:00:23,464 --> 00:00:27,342
? If I didn't care

2
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:32,848
? More than words can say

3
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:38,103
? If I didn't care

4
00:00:39,314 --> 00:00:43,317
? Would I feel this way?

5
00:00:44,485 --> 00:00:48,531
? If this isn't love

6
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:54,162
? Then why do I thrill?

7
00:00:55,581 --> 00:01:01,336
? And what makes my head
go round and round

8
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,215
? While my heart stands still?

9
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,928
? If I didn't care

10
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:14,849
? Would it be the same?

11
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:22,607
? Would my every prayer begin and end

12
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:25,610
? With just your name?

13
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:30,490
? And would I be sure

14
00:01:30,574 --> 00:01:36,454
? That this is love beyond compare?

15
00:01:38,123 --> 00:01:40,166
? Would all this be true

16
00:01:41,585 --> 00:01:46,674
? If I didn't care for you?

17
00:02:04,693 --> 00:02:06,694
Mr. Dufresne,

18
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:11,031
describe the confrontation you had
with your wife the night she was murdered.

19
00:02:15,662 --> 00:02:17,788
It was very bitter.

20
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:22,292
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around...

21
00:02:23,712 --> 00:02:27,256
And she said she wanted a divorce in Reno.

22
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,174
What was your response?

23
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:31,218
I told her I would not grant one.

24
00:02:31,302 --> 00:02:34,346
"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."

25
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:38,100
Those were the words you used, Mr. Dufresne,
according to your neighbors.

26
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:42,897
If they say so.
I really don't remember. I was upset.

27
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:47,527
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

28
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:49,529
She packed a bag.

29
00:02:50,614 --> 00:02:53,783
She packed a bag to go and stay with...
Mr. Quentin.

30
00:02:53,868 --> 00:02:56,161
Glenn Quentin.

31
00:02:56,245 --> 00:02:58,329
Golf pro at the Snowdon Hills Country Club.

32
00:02:58,414 --> 00:03:02,292
The man you discovered was your wife's lover.

33
00:03:04,045 --> 00:03:05,420
Did you follow her?

34
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:08,840
I went to a few bars first.

35
00:03:08,924 --> 00:03:11,801
Later, I drove to his house to confront them.

36
00:03:11,886 --> 00:03:15,472
They weren't home, so I...parked in the turnout,

37
00:03:15,556 --> 00:03:17,140
and waited.

38
00:03:17,224 --> 00:03:19,434
With what intention?

39
00:03:19,518 --> 00:03:21,311
I'm not sure.

40
00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:23,605
I was confused.

41
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:25,356
Drunk.

42
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:30,111
I think...mostly, I wanted to scare them.

43
00:03:30,196 --> 00:03:33,448
When they arrived,
you went up to the house and murdered them.

44
00:03:33,532 --> 00:03:36,618
No. I was sobering up.

45
00:03:36,702 --> 00:03:39,454
I got back in the car,
and I drove home to sleep it off.

46
00:03:39,538 --> 00:03:43,000
Along the way, I stopped,
and I threw my gun into the Royal River.

47
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:45,294
I feel I've been very clear on this point.

48
00:03:45,378 --> 00:03:49,173
Well, where I get hazy is where the cleaning
woman shows up the following morning

49
00:03:49,257 --> 00:03:54,929
and finds your wife in bed with her lover,
riddled with.38 caliber bullets.

50
00:03:55,972 --> 00:04:00,226
Now, does that strike you as a fantastic
coincidence, Mr. Dufresne, or is it just me?

51
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,144
Yes, it does.

52
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:08,317
Yet you still maintain that you threw your gun
into the river before the murders took place?

53
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:12,196
- That's very convenient.
- It's the truth.

54
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,992
The police dragged that river
for three days, and nary a gun was found.

55
00:04:17,077 --> 00:04:19,870
So, there could be no comparison made
between your gun

56
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:24,125
and the bullets taken from
the bloodstained corpses of the victims.

57
00:04:25,418 --> 00:04:28,295
And that also...

58
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,381
is very convenient.

59
00:04:30,465 --> 00:04:31,966
Isnâ€™t it, Mr. Dufresne?

60
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:35,427
Since I am innocent of this crime, sir,

61
00:04:35,512 --> 00:04:39,099
I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

62
00:04:40,268 --> 00:04:42,352
If I Didn't Care

63
00:04:46,274 --> 00:04:49,526
? And would I be sure that this

64
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:54,239
? Is love beyond compare...

65
00:04:57,785 --> 00:05:00,704
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've heard all the evidence.

66
00:05:00,788 --> 00:05:03,373
We have the accused at the scene of the crime.

67
00:05:03,457 --> 00:05:05,292
We have footprints, tire tracks,

68
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:09,421
bullets strewn on the ground which bear
his fingerprints, a broken bourbon bottle,

69
00:05:09,505 --> 00:05:11,631
likewise with fingerprints.

70
00:05:11,716 --> 00:05:13,383
And most of all,

71
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:15,760
we have a beautiful young woman and her lover

72
00:05:15,845 --> 00:05:17,929
lying dead in each other's arms.

73
00:05:20,016 --> 00:05:22,267
They had sinned.

74
00:05:23,895 --> 00:05:27,898
But was their crime so great
as to merit a death sentence?

75
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:31,151
Now, while you think about that...

76
00:05:32,862 --> 00:05:35,363
..think about this.

77
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:37,992
A revolver holds six bullets.

78
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:39,452
Not eight.

79
00:05:39,536 --> 00:05:42,997
I submit that this was not a hot-blooded
crime of passion.

80
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:46,125
That could be understood, if not condoned.

81
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,836
No. This was revenge...

82
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:53,424
of a much more brutal
and cold-blooded nature. Consider this.

83
00:05:53,508 --> 00:05:56,052
Four bullets per victim.

84
00:05:56,136 --> 00:05:58,512
Not six shots fired, but eight.

85
00:05:58,597 --> 00:06:02,516
That means that he fired the gun empty,

86
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:04,894
and then stopped to reload...

87
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:08,564
..so that he could shoot each of them again.

88
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:11,234
An extra bullet per lover.

89
00:06:11,318 --> 00:06:13,361
Right in the head.

90
00:06:17,407 --> 00:06:22,328
You strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

91
00:06:22,412 --> 00:06:24,664
It chills my blood just to look at you.

92
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,377
By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine,

93
00:06:29,461 --> 00:06:33,005
I hereby order you to serve two life sentences,
back to back.

94
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:36,718
One for each of your victims. So be it.

95
00:07:01,744 --> 00:07:03,412
Sit.

96
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:10,377
We see by your file
you've served 20 years of a life sentence.

97
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:12,045
Yes, sir.

98
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,589
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

99
00:07:14,674 --> 00:07:16,883
Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

100
00:07:18,511 --> 00:07:20,470
I mean, I learned my lesson.

101
00:07:21,556 --> 00:07:24,808
I can honestly say...I'm a changed man.

102
00:07:28,521 --> 00:07:30,856
I'm no longer a danger to society.

103
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,026
That's God's honest truth.

104
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,981
Hey, Red. How'd it go?

105
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:14,692
Same old shit. Different day.

106
00:08:14,777 --> 00:08:18,404
Yeah. I know how you feel.
I'm up for rejection next week.

107
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:22,158
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

108
00:08:22,242 --> 00:08:23,534
It happens.

109
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:25,203
Hey, Red. Bump me a deck.

110
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:28,664
Get the fuck out of my face, will you, man?
You've had five packs already.

111
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:29,957
- Four.
- Five.

112
00:08:31,002 --> 00:08:34,546
There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.

113
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:36,548
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

114
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:39,760
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer
- if that's your thing -

115
00:08:39,844 --> 00:08:43,430
a bottle of brandy
to celebrate your kid's high-school graduation.

116
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:45,849
Damn near anything, within reason.

117
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:48,227
Yes, sir. I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

118
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,943
So, when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949

119
00:08:56,027 --> 00:08:59,363
and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth
into the prison for him,

120
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:01,532
I told him, "No problem."

121
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,910
Andy came to Shawshank Prison

122
00:09:45,995 --> 00:09:50,123
in early 1947, for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

123
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:54,502
On the outside he had been vice-president
of a large Portland bank.

124
00:09:54,587 --> 00:09:56,588
Good work for a man as young as he was.

125
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,636
Hey, Red.

126
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:43,344
Do you speak English, butt steak?
You follow this officer.

127
00:10:56,316 --> 00:11:00,694
I haven't seen such a sorry-looking heap
of m-m-maggot shit in all my life.

128
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:02,863
Hey, fish! Come over here.

129
00:11:17,921 --> 00:11:20,798
Come on, fish.

130
00:11:26,264 --> 00:11:28,181
Taking bets today, Red?

131
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:30,267
Smokes or coins? Better's choice.

132
00:11:30,351 --> 00:11:32,143
Smokes. Put me down for two.

133
00:11:32,228 --> 00:11:34,271
All right. Who's your horse?

134
00:11:34,355 --> 00:11:37,649
That little sack of
shit...eighth from the front.

135
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:38,900
He'll be first.

136
00:11:38,985 --> 00:11:41,194
- Bullshit. I'll take that action.
- Me too.

137
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,530
You're out some smokes, son. Let me tell you.

138
00:11:43,614 --> 00:11:45,532
Heywood, you're so smart, you call it.

139
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:48,118
I'll take...t-t-the chubby fat-ass there.

140
00:11:48,202 --> 00:11:51,580
The fifth one from the front.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

141
00:11:51,664 --> 00:11:54,541
Fresh fish!

142
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:58,712
Fresh fish today! We're reeling them in!

143
00:11:58,796 --> 00:12:03,049
I must admit, I didn't think much of Andy,
first time I laid eyes on him.

144
00:12:03,134 --> 00:12:06,636
Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.

145
00:12:06,721 --> 00:12:09,014
That was my first impression of the man.

146
00:12:09,098 --> 00:12:10,807
What do you say, Red?

147
00:12:10,891 --> 00:12:14,144
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

148
00:12:14,228 --> 00:12:16,396
That guy? Never happen.

149
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,606
Ten cigarettes.

150
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,857
That's a rich bet.

151
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:21,151
All right. Who's gonna prove me wrong?

152
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:23,321
Heywood? Jigger?

153
00:12:23,405 --> 00:12:24,864
Skeet?

154
00:12:24,948 --> 00:12:27,158
Floyd?

155
00:12:27,242 --> 00:12:29,368
Four brave souls.

156
00:12:29,453 --> 00:12:32,288
Return to your cell blocks for evening count.

157
00:12:32,372 --> 00:12:34,874
All prisoners return to your cell blocks.

158
00:12:55,979 --> 00:12:58,064
Turn to the right. Eyes front.

159
00:13:11,495 --> 00:13:14,497
This is Mr. Hadley. He's Captain of the Guards.

160
00:13:14,581 --> 00:13:16,749
I'm Mr. Norton, the Warden.

161
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,335
You are convicted felons.

162
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:21,755
That's why they've sent you to me.

163
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,465
Rule number one:

164
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:25,425
No blasphemy.

165
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,054
I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain
in my prison.

166
00:13:29,138 --> 00:13:30,514
The other rules...

167
00:13:30,598 --> 00:13:32,307
you'll figure out as you go along.

168
00:13:32,392 --> 00:13:34,184
Any questions?

169
00:13:34,268 --> 00:13:35,477
When do we eat?

170
00:13:43,986 --> 00:13:46,154
You eat when we say you eat!

171
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:49,616
You shit when we say you shit,
and you piss when we say you piss.

172
00:13:49,701 --> 00:13:52,577
You got that, you maggot-dick motherfucker?

173
00:13:52,662 --> 00:13:53,954
Aarghh!

174
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:55,997
On your feet.

175
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:57,874
I believe in two things.

176
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,836
Discipline and the Bible.

177
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,754
Here you'll receive both.

178
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:06,508
Put your trust in the Lord.

179
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:08,468
Your ass belongs to me.

180
00:14:10,555 --> 00:14:12,639
Welcome to Shawshank.

181
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,188
Unhook 'em.

182
00:14:24,445 --> 00:14:26,320
Turn around.

183
00:14:32,745 --> 00:14:35,079
That's enough.

184
00:14:35,164 --> 00:14:37,915
Move to the end of the cage.

185
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,375
Turn around.

186
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,710
Delouse him.

187
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,796
Turn around.

188
00:14:46,383 --> 00:14:49,552
Move out of the cage, go left.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

189
00:14:49,636 --> 00:14:51,179
Next man up.

190
00:14:53,307 --> 00:14:56,476
To the right. Right, right, right.

191
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,102
Left, left...

192
00:14:58,187 --> 00:15:02,356
The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.

193
00:15:02,441 --> 00:15:05,568
They march you in,
naked as the day you were born,

194
00:15:05,652 --> 00:15:09,739
skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit they throw on you.

195
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,784
And when they put you in that cell,

196
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:15,536
and those bars slam home...

197
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:18,373
that's when you know it's for real.

198
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:21,794
Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.

199
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:23,086
Nothing left,

200
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:25,881
but all the time in the world to think about it.

201
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:30,886
Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.

202
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,264
Somebody always breaks down crying.

203
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:36,809
Happens every time.

204
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:38,977
The only question is:

205
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:40,479
Who's it gonna be?

206
00:15:41,564 --> 00:15:44,149
It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.

207
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:48,153
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

208
00:15:57,789 --> 00:15:59,414
Lights out!

209
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,022
I remember my first night.

210
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,191
Seems like a long time ago.

211
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,195
Yoo-hoo!

212
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,781
Hey, fish.

213
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:34,909
Fish, fish, fish, fish, fishy.

214
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,913
- Boy, are you scared of the dark?
- You like it here, new fish?

215
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,332
You'll wish
your daddy never dicked your mommy.

216
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:45,420
Fishy! Oh, I want me a pork chop. Oh, yes!

217
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:50,550
You taking this down, new fish?
There's gonna be a quiz later!

218
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:54,012
- Poke your ass out, give me a first look!
- Shh! Keep it down.

219
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,432
The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.

220
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,559
They don't quit till they reel someone in.

221
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,731
Hey, Fat Ass.

222
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,482
Fat Ass.

223
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,153
Talk to me, boy.

224
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,947
I know you're there. I can hear you breathing.

225
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,951
Don't you listen to these nitwits.
You hear me?

226
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,120
This place ain't so bad.

227
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,830
I tell you what.

228
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:24,168
I'll introduce you around.
Make you feel right at home.

229
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,837
I know a couple of big old bull queers

230
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:29,882
that would just love to make your acquaintance.

231
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:33,385
Especially that big, white,
m- mushy butt of yours.

232
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,387
God!

233
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:36,972
I don't belong here!

234
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,474
We have a winner!

235
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,309
I wanna go home!

236
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,227
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

237
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:45,481
Hey, it's the fat guy! It's the fat guy!

238
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:49,401
Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Fresh fish!

239
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:52,196
I don't belong here!

240
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,489
Fresh fish!

241
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,909
I wanna go home. I want my mommy.

242
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,995
I had your mother. She wasn't that great.

243
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,580
Fresh fish!

244
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,210
What the Christ is this happy horse shit?

245
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:09,004
He took the Lord's name in vain.
I'm telling the Warden.

246
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,589
With my baton up your ass!

247
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,342
Let me out of here!

248
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:15,804
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

249
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:17,055
Please...

250
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:19,182
I ain't supposed to be here.

251
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,642
Not me!

252
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:23,186
I ain't gonna count to three, or even one.

253
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,563
Shut the fuck up, or I'll sing you a lullaby!

254
00:18:25,648 --> 00:18:27,482
Shut up, man. Shut up.

255
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:28,858
There's been a mistake!

256
00:18:28,943 --> 00:18:32,112
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here!

257
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:33,279
Open that cell.

258
00:18:33,364 --> 00:18:37,534
Me neither.
You people run this place like a fucking prison!

259
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:47,043
Son of a bitch.

260
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:53,299
Take it easy.

261
00:19:16,074 --> 00:19:19,452
If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here
the rest of the night,

262
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:23,205
I swear by God and sonny Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

263
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,374
Every last motherfucker in here.

264
00:19:29,296 --> 00:19:32,965
Call the trustees.
Take that tub of shit down to the infirmary.

265
00:19:47,272 --> 00:19:51,984
His first night in the joint,
Andy Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.

266
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:54,945
He never made a sound.

267
00:20:10,463 --> 00:20:13,715
Tier 3 North. Clear.

268
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,967
Tier 2 South. Clear.

269
00:20:16,052 --> 00:20:17,928
Tier 3 South. Clear.

270
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:19,971
Tier 1 North...

271
00:20:20,056 --> 00:20:22,849
- Tier 1 South. Clear.
- Tier 4 South. Clear.

272
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:25,018
Prepare to roll out.

273
00:20:28,397 --> 00:20:30,482
Roll out!

274
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,164
Are... Are you going to eat that?

275
00:21:26,248 --> 00:21:29,167
I hadn't... I hadn't planned on it.

276
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:31,460
Do you mind?

277
00:21:38,802 --> 00:21:41,429
Ah...that's nice and ripe.

278
00:21:53,025 --> 00:21:55,484
Jake says thank you.

279
00:21:55,569 --> 00:21:57,987
Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.

280
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,786
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

281
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:06,663
Oh, no, no. Here he comes.

282
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:13,712
Morning, fellas. Fine morning, ain't it?

283
00:22:13,796 --> 00:22:16,215
You know why it's a fine morning, don't you?

284
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:18,717
Come on. Set 'em down.
I want 'em all lined up here,

285
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:21,595
just like a pretty little chorus line.

286
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,764
Yeah, look at that!

287
00:22:23,848 --> 00:22:26,725
- Look at that. Oh, Lord!
- I can't stand this guy.

288
00:22:27,936 --> 00:22:30,604
Yes. Richmond, Virginia.

289
00:22:30,688 --> 00:22:32,773
- Smell my ass!
- After he smells mine.

290
00:22:32,857 --> 00:22:38,195
Gee, Red, it was a terrible shame
about your horse coming in last, an' all.

291
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:41,490
But I sure do love that winning horse of mine,
though.

292
00:22:41,574 --> 00:22:44,284
I owe that boy a great big, sloppy kiss
when I see him.

293
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:47,371
Why don't you give him some of your cigarettes,
instead?

294
00:22:47,455 --> 00:22:49,248
Lucky fuck.

295
00:22:49,332 --> 00:22:51,041
Hey, Tyrell.

296
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:54,086
You pull infirmary duty this week?

297
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,879
How's that horse of mine doing?

298
00:22:55,964 --> 00:22:57,422
Dead.

299
00:22:57,507 --> 00:23:02,887
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.
The doc had already gone home for the night.

300
00:23:02,888 --> 00:23:05,640
Poor bastard lay there till this morning.

301
00:23:05,724 --> 00:23:08,559
By then, hell, there
weren't nothing we could do.

302
00:23:14,358 --> 00:23:15,942
What was his name?

303
00:23:19,196 --> 00:23:20,571
What did you say?

304
00:23:22,449 --> 00:23:24,826
I was just wondering if anyone knew his name.

305
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,620
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

306
00:23:29,081 --> 00:23:32,458
It doesn't fuckin' matter what his name was.
He's dead.

307
00:23:51,812 --> 00:23:54,147
Hey...

308
00:23:54,231 --> 00:23:56,983
Anybody come at you yet?

309
00:23:58,485 --> 00:24:00,487
Anybody get to you yet?

310
00:24:01,614 --> 00:24:04,658
Hey, we all need friends in here.

311
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,660
I could be a friend to you.

312
00:24:09,122 --> 00:24:10,789
Hey...

313
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:17,504
Hard to get.

314
00:24:19,174 --> 00:24:20,841
I like that.

315
00:24:27,474 --> 00:24:30,768
Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.

316
00:24:30,852 --> 00:24:33,312
I guess he had a lot on his mind,

317
00:24:33,396 --> 00:24:35,606
trying to adapt to life on the inside.

318
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,860
It wasn't until a month went by
that he opened his mouth

319
00:24:39,944 --> 00:24:42,237
to say more than two words to somebody.

320
00:24:44,157 --> 00:24:46,200
As it turned out...

321
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,202
that somebody was me.

322
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,959
Officers Russell and Burwell
report to the duty officer.

323
00:24:57,003 --> 00:24:59,756
I'm Andy Dufresne.

324
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,925
The wife-killing banker.

325
00:25:03,761 --> 00:25:05,470
Why did you do it?

326
00:25:05,554 --> 00:25:07,180
I didn't, since you ask.

327
00:25:07,264 --> 00:25:10,308
You're gonna fit right in!

328
00:25:10,393 --> 00:25:13,561
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

329
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:16,981
- Heywood, what are you in here for?
- Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

330
00:25:19,902 --> 00:25:22,695
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

331
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:26,533
You think your shit smells sweeter than most.
Is that right?

332
00:25:26,617 --> 00:25:28,952
- What do you think?
- To tell you the truth,

333
00:25:29,036 --> 00:25:32,122
I haven't made up my mind.

334
00:25:32,206 --> 00:25:36,292
I understand
you're a man that knows how to get things.

335
00:25:36,377 --> 00:25:39,879
I'm known to locate certain things,
from time to time.

336
00:25:39,964 --> 00:25:42,966
- I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.
- A what?

337
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:44,426
A rock hammer.

338
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,803
- What is it, and why?
- What do you care?

339
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:51,558
Well, if it was a toothbrush,
I'd just quote a price,

340
00:25:51,642 --> 00:25:54,227
but then a toothbrush is a non-lethal object.

341
00:25:55,646 --> 00:25:57,356
Fair enough.

342
00:25:57,441 --> 00:25:59,900
A rock hammer
is about six or seven inches long.

343
00:25:59,985 --> 00:26:01,610
Looks like a miniature pickaxe.

344
00:26:01,695 --> 00:26:02,820
Pickaxe?

345
00:26:02,904 --> 00:26:04,989
- For rocks.
- Rocks.

346
00:26:06,658 --> 00:26:08,826
Quartz?

347
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,578
Quartz.

348
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,206
And some mica.

349
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:15,458
Shale.

350
00:26:16,543 --> 00:26:18,127
Limestone.

351
00:26:18,211 --> 00:26:20,129
So?

352
00:26:20,213 --> 00:26:22,298
So, I'm a rock hound.

353
00:26:22,382 --> 00:26:25,593
At least, I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again on a limited basis.

354
00:26:25,677 --> 00:26:27,803
Or maybe you want
to hammer somebody's skull.

355
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:29,346
No, sir.

356
00:26:30,474 --> 00:26:32,057
I have no enemies here.

357
00:26:32,142 --> 00:26:34,518
No? Wait a while.

358
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:38,230
Word gets around.

359
00:26:38,315 --> 00:26:41,442
The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.

360
00:26:41,526 --> 00:26:43,319
Especially Bogs.

361
00:26:44,404 --> 00:26:48,616
I don't suppose it would help any
if I explained to them I'm not homosexual.

362
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,201
Neither are they.

363
00:26:50,285 --> 00:26:52,995
You have to be human first. They don't qualify.

364
00:26:58,252 --> 00:27:02,797
Bull queers take by force.
It's all they want or understand.

365
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:06,510
If I were you,
I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.

366
00:27:06,594 --> 00:27:07,928
Thanks for the advice.

367
00:27:08,012 --> 00:27:09,596
Well, that's free.

368
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,932
You understand my concern.

369
00:27:12,016 --> 00:27:14,559
Well, if there's any trouble,
I won't use the hammer.

370
00:27:14,644 --> 00:27:18,855
Then I guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

371
00:27:20,316 --> 00:27:22,108
Did I miss something? What's funny?

372
00:27:22,193 --> 00:27:25,237
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

373
00:27:27,114 --> 00:27:29,115
What's an item like this usually go for?

374
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,244
Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.

375
00:27:32,328 --> 00:27:35,038
My normal mark-up's 20 per cent.

376
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,582
But this is a specialty item.

377
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:40,252
The risk goes up, the price goes up.

378
00:27:40,253 --> 00:27:42,212
Let's make it an even ten bucks.

379
00:27:42,296 --> 00:27:44,172
Ten it is.

380
00:27:45,258 --> 00:27:47,676
Waste of money, if you ask me.

381
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,302
Why's that?

382
00:27:50,388 --> 00:27:53,432
Folks around this joint
love surprise inspections.

383
00:27:55,018 --> 00:27:57,311
If they find it, you're gonna lose it.

384
00:27:57,396 --> 00:27:59,522
If they do catch you with it, you don't know me.

385
00:27:59,606 --> 00:28:01,816
Mention my name, we never do business again.

386
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,027
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now, you got that?

387
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,947
I understand.

388
00:28:08,031 --> 00:28:09,448
Thank you...

389
00:28:09,449 --> 00:28:11,075
Mr. er...?

390
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:13,619
Red. The name's Red.

391
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,662
Red?

392
00:28:14,746 --> 00:28:17,498
Why do they call you that?

393
00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:23,254
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

394
00:28:31,221 --> 00:28:34,265
I could see
why some of the boys took him for snobby.

395
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:37,768
He had a quiet way about him.

396
00:28:37,853 --> 00:28:42,315
A walk and a talk
that just wasn't normal around here.

397
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,941
He strolled...

398
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:48,362
like a man in a park,
without a care or worry in the world.

399
00:28:48,447 --> 00:28:53,160
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

400
00:28:53,244 --> 00:28:57,414
Yeah. I think it would be fair to say...

401
00:28:57,415 --> 00:28:59,499
I liked Andy from the start.

402
00:29:01,252 --> 00:29:04,463
Let's go!
Some of us have got a schedule to keep.

403
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:09,843
Move it! Come on. Move it!

404
00:29:13,473 --> 00:29:16,600
Bob, how are you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

405
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,778
Easy.

406
00:29:27,862 --> 00:29:29,946
Keep it moving.

407
00:29:32,742 --> 00:29:33,992
Red...

408
00:29:54,515 --> 00:29:58,726
Andy was right. I finally got the joke.

409
00:29:58,811 --> 00:30:03,314
It would take a man about 600 years
to tunnel under the wall with one of these.

410
00:30:07,653 --> 00:30:08,778
Book?

411
00:30:08,862 --> 00:30:10,738
Not today.

412
00:30:16,078 --> 00:30:18,162
- Book?
- No.

413
00:30:19,957 --> 00:30:21,165
Hey, Brooksy.

414
00:30:24,461 --> 00:30:26,546
Delivery for Dufresne.

415
00:30:33,637 --> 00:30:39,267
Book?

416
00:30:42,271 --> 00:30:44,397
Dufresne...

417
00:30:44,481 --> 00:30:46,650
Here's your book.

418
00:30:51,072 --> 00:30:52,740
Thanks.

419
00:30:56,578 --> 00:30:59,788
Dufresne! We're running low on Hexlite.

420
00:30:59,873 --> 00:31:01,957
Get on back and fetch us up some.

421
00:31:39,162 --> 00:31:41,121
If you get this in your eyes, it blinds you.

422
00:31:41,206 --> 00:31:43,957
Honey...hush.

423
00:31:56,013 --> 00:31:58,431
That's it. You fight.

424
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,099
It's better that way.

425
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:11,361
I wish I could tell you
that Andy fought the good fight,

426
00:32:11,445 --> 00:32:13,988
and the Sisters let him be.

427
00:32:14,073 --> 00:32:16,074
I wish I could tell you that.

428
00:32:16,158 --> 00:32:18,243
But prison is no fairy-tale world.

429
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:22,330
He never said who did it.

430
00:32:22,414 --> 00:32:25,458
But we all knew.

431
00:32:28,796 --> 00:32:31,673
Things went on like that for a while.

432
00:32:31,757 --> 00:32:34,384
Prison life consists of routine...

433
00:32:34,468 --> 00:32:36,678
and then more routine.

434
00:32:39,056 --> 00:32:42,893
Every so often,
Andy would show up with fresh bruises.

435
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:46,105
The Sisters kept at him.

436
00:32:46,189 --> 00:32:50,317
Sometimes he was able to fight 'em off.
Sometimes not.

437
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:53,654
And that's how it went for Andy.

438
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:56,282
That was his routine.

439
00:32:56,366 --> 00:33:00,160
I do believe
those first two years were the worst for him.

440
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:02,496
And I also believe,

441
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:07,126
if things had gone on that way,
this place would have got the best of him.

442
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:10,170
But then, in the spring of 1949,

443
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:12,256
the powers that be decided that...

444
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,759
The roof of the license-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

445
00:33:15,844 --> 00:33:18,596
I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.

446
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,891
As you know,

447
00:33:21,975 --> 00:33:25,686
special detail carries
with it special privileges.

448
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,855
It was outdoor detail...

449
00:33:29,357 --> 00:33:32,943
..and May is one damn fine month
to be working outdoors.

450
00:33:33,028 --> 00:33:34,653
Stay in line there.

451
00:33:34,738 --> 00:33:37,656
More than a hundred men
volunteered for the job.

452
00:33:42,038 --> 00:33:44,331
Wallace E Unger.

453
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:47,959
Ellis Redding.

454
00:33:48,044 --> 00:33:50,879
Wouldn't you know it?

455
00:33:50,963 --> 00:33:53,548
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names.

456
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:55,717
Andrew Dufresne.

457
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:59,346
It only cost us a pack of smokes per man.

458
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:02,140
I made my usual 20 per cent, of course.

459
00:34:02,224 --> 00:34:05,810
So, this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

460
00:34:05,895 --> 00:34:07,604
I say, "Yeah?"

461
00:34:07,688 --> 00:34:11,399
He says, "Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

462
00:34:11,484 --> 00:34:13,985
Oh, damn, Byron. I'm sorry to hear that.

463
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,445
I'm not. He was an asshole.

464
00:34:15,529 --> 00:34:17,864
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead, anyway.

465
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:21,910
So, anyway, this lawyer fella says to me,
"Your brother died a rich man."

466
00:34:21,994 --> 00:34:24,704
Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks.

467
00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:27,248
A million bucks?

468
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:29,709
Fucking incredible
how lucky some assholes get.

469
00:34:29,794 --> 00:34:32,337
Jeez-Louise! Are you gonna see any of that?

470
00:34:32,421 --> 00:34:35,507
35,000. That's what he left me.

471
00:34:35,591 --> 00:34:37,509
- Dollars?
- Yeah.

472
00:34:37,593 --> 00:34:40,721
Holy shit! That's great.
That's like winning the sweepstakes.

473
00:34:40,806 --> 00:34:42,014
Isnâ€™t it?

474
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:45,142
Dumb shit. What do you think
the government's gonna do to me?

475
00:34:45,227 --> 00:34:47,770
Take a big, wet bite out of my ass, is what.

476
00:34:47,771 --> 00:34:51,941
Poor Byron! Terrible fucking luck, huh?

477
00:34:52,025 --> 00:34:54,694
Crying shame.

478
00:34:54,778 --> 00:34:56,445
Some people really got it awful!

479
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,072
Andy, are you nuts?

480
00:34:58,156 --> 00:35:00,282
Keep your eyes on your mop, man. Andy!

481
00:35:00,283 --> 00:35:03,327
Well, you'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up...

482
00:35:03,412 --> 00:35:06,247
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Maybe enough to buy a new car. Then what?

483
00:35:06,331 --> 00:35:08,708
I've got to pay tax on the car.

484
00:35:08,792 --> 00:35:12,670
Repair, maintenance, goddamn kids
pestering me to take them for a ride...

485
00:35:12,754 --> 00:35:16,674
And at the end of the year, you figure the tax
wrong, you pay them out of your own pocket.

486
00:35:16,758 --> 00:35:18,926
I tell you...Uncle Sam!

487
00:35:19,011 --> 00:35:22,763
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

488
00:35:22,848 --> 00:35:25,558
- Andy! Andy!
- What's he doing?

489
00:35:25,642 --> 00:35:27,977
- Getting himself killed.
- Keep tarring.

490
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:31,147
Some brother! Shit.

491
00:35:31,231 --> 00:35:32,273
Hey!

492
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,821
Mr. Hadley...

493
00:35:37,822 --> 00:35:39,281
do you trust your wife?

494
00:35:40,825 --> 00:35:42,576
Oh, that's funny.

495
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,537
You're gonna look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

496
00:35:45,621 --> 00:35:49,082
I mean, do you think
she'd go behind your back, try to hamstring you?

497
00:35:50,168 --> 00:35:52,044
That's it. Step aside, Mert.

498
00:35:52,128 --> 00:35:53,628
This fucker's having an accident.

499
00:35:53,713 --> 00:35:54,880
He's gonna push him off.

500
00:35:54,964 --> 00:35:59,092
Cos if you do trust her,
there's no reason you can't keep that 35,000.

501
00:35:59,177 --> 00:36:01,053
- What did you say?
- 35,000.

502
00:36:01,137 --> 00:36:02,846
- 35,000?
- All of it.

503
00:36:02,847 --> 00:36:05,182
- All of it?
- Every penny.

504
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:07,100
You'd better start making sense.

505
00:36:07,185 --> 00:36:09,519
If you want to keep the money,
give it to your wife.

506
00:36:09,604 --> 00:36:13,732
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

507
00:36:13,816 --> 00:36:15,358
Bullshit! Tax-free?

508
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,528
Tax-free. The IRS can't touch one cent.

509
00:36:18,613 --> 00:36:21,198
You're the smart banker what killed his wife.

510
00:36:21,282 --> 00:36:24,826
Why should I believe a smart banker like you?
So I can end up in here with you?

511
00:36:24,911 --> 00:36:26,411
It's legal. Ask the IRS.

512
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:29,706
They'll say the same thing.
But I feel stupid telling you this.

513
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:32,084
I'm sure you would have investigated the matter.

514
00:36:32,168 --> 00:36:36,255
Yeah, I don't need no banker to tell me
where the bears shit in the buckwheat.

515
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,383
Of course not, but you do need someone
to set up the tax-free gift.

516
00:36:39,468 --> 00:36:41,344
It'll cost you. A lawyer.

517
00:36:41,428 --> 00:36:43,763
A bunch of ball-washing bastards.

518
00:36:43,847 --> 00:36:47,683
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

519
00:36:47,684 --> 00:36:50,061
If you get the forms, I'll prepare them for you.

520
00:36:50,145 --> 00:36:52,021
Nearly free of charge.

521
00:36:53,107 --> 00:36:56,484
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my co-workers.

522
00:36:56,568 --> 00:36:58,986
Co-workers! Get him! That's rich, ain't it?

523
00:36:59,071 --> 00:37:02,532
I think a man working outdoors
feels more like a man

524
00:37:02,616 --> 00:37:04,367
if he can have a bottle of suds.

525
00:37:04,451 --> 00:37:07,495
That's only my opinion...sir.

526
00:37:10,916 --> 00:37:12,458
What are you jimmies staring at?

527
00:37:12,543 --> 00:37:13,543
Back to work!

528
00:37:13,627 --> 00:37:15,586
Let's go. Work.

529
00:37:23,971 --> 00:37:29,475
And that's how it came to pass...
that on the second-to-last day of the job,

530
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:34,231
the convict crew that tarred the
plate-factory roof in the spring of '49...

531
00:37:34,315 --> 00:37:37,526
wound up sitting in a row
at ten o'clock in the morning,

532
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:41,488
drinking icy-cold, Bohemia-style beer...

533
00:37:41,573 --> 00:37:46,785
courtesy of the hardest screw that ever
walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.

534
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,954
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

535
00:37:50,331 --> 00:37:54,501
The colossal prick
even managed to sound magnanimous.

536
00:37:56,254 --> 00:38:00,883
We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders,
and felt like free men.

537
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:04,469
Hell, we could have been tarring the roof
of one of our own houses.

538
00:38:04,554 --> 00:38:07,848
We were the lords of all creation.

539
00:38:07,932 --> 00:38:12,477
As for Andy,
he spent that break hunkered in the shade...

540
00:38:12,562 --> 00:38:15,272
a strange little smile on his face,

541
00:38:15,356 --> 00:38:17,441
watching us drink his beer.

542
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,741
Hey...

543
00:38:25,825 --> 00:38:27,117
Want a cold one, Andy?

544
00:38:27,202 --> 00:38:28,869
No, thanks.

545
00:38:28,953 --> 00:38:30,746
I gave up drinking.

546
00:38:34,585 --> 00:38:37,754
You could argue
he'd done it to curry favor with the guards.

547
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:40,673
Or maybe make a few friends among us cons.

548
00:38:42,927 --> 00:38:46,387
Me, I think he did it just to feel normal again.

549
00:38:47,473 --> 00:38:49,557
If only for a short while.

550
00:38:52,436 --> 00:38:54,771
King me.

551
00:38:54,855 --> 00:38:57,273
Chess. Now, there's a game of kings.

552
00:38:57,358 --> 00:38:59,901
- What?
- Civilized, strategic.

553
00:38:59,985 --> 00:39:02,320
And a total fucking mystery.

554
00:39:02,404 --> 00:39:03,613
I hate it.

555
00:39:03,697 --> 00:39:05,615
Maybe you'll let me teach you someday.

556
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:08,159
Yeah. Sure.

557
00:39:08,244 --> 00:39:10,370
I thought of getting a board together.

558
00:39:10,454 --> 00:39:13,248
Well, I'm the right man.
I'm the guy that can get things.

559
00:39:13,332 --> 00:39:14,832
We might do business on a board.

560
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:17,710
But I want to carve the pieces myself.

561
00:39:17,795 --> 00:39:21,381
One side in alabaster, the opposing side
in soapstone. What do you think?

562
00:39:21,465 --> 00:39:23,383
I think it'll take years.

563
00:39:23,467 --> 00:39:26,052
Well, years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

564
00:39:26,136 --> 00:39:28,304
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

565
00:39:28,389 --> 00:39:30,349
Pebbles, mostly.

566
00:39:34,688 --> 00:39:37,564
Andy, we're getting to be kinda friends,
aren't we?

567
00:39:37,649 --> 00:39:39,316
Yeah, I guess.

568
00:39:40,443 --> 00:39:42,861
Can I ask you something?

569
00:39:42,946 --> 00:39:44,947
Why did you do it?

570
00:39:46,157 --> 00:39:50,035
I'm innocent, Red. Just
like everybody else here.

571
00:39:54,332 --> 00:39:56,417
What are you in for?

572
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,420
Murder.

573
00:39:59,504 --> 00:40:00,921
Same as you.

574
00:40:01,006 --> 00:40:02,172
Innocent?

575
00:40:04,843 --> 00:40:06,927
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

576
00:41:06,405 --> 00:41:07,989
Where's the canary?

577
00:41:08,074 --> 00:41:09,407
How did you know?

578
00:41:09,408 --> 00:41:10,575
How did I know what?

579
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:13,078
So, you don't know? Come.

580
00:41:15,831 --> 00:41:17,957
This is where the canary is, Johnny.

581
00:41:20,336 --> 00:41:24,339
Quite a surprise to hear a woman singing
in my house, eh, Johnny?

582
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,637
That's quite a...

583
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:31,389
surprise.

584
00:41:33,892 --> 00:41:35,601
Red...

585
00:41:35,685 --> 00:41:37,478
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

586
00:41:37,562 --> 00:41:39,397
Here she comes.

587
00:41:39,481 --> 00:41:42,358
This is the part I like -
when she does that shit with her hair.

588
00:41:42,442 --> 00:41:45,361
Yeah, I know. I've seen
it three times this month.

589
00:41:45,445 --> 00:41:47,446
Gilda, are you decent?

590
00:41:47,531 --> 00:41:49,573
Me?

591
00:41:51,284 --> 00:41:53,327
Hah! God, I love it!

592
00:41:59,209 --> 00:42:03,003
I understand
you're a man that knows how to get things.

593
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:06,966
Yeah, I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

594
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,552
- Rita Hayworth.
- What?

595
00:42:09,636 --> 00:42:11,470
Can you get her?

596
00:42:12,556 --> 00:42:16,016
So, this is Johnny Farrell.
I've heard a lot about you, Johnny.

597
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:17,977
Take a few weeks.

598
00:42:18,061 --> 00:42:19,270
Weeks?

599
00:42:19,271 --> 00:42:21,898
Well, yeah, Andy. I don't
have her stuffed down the

600
00:42:21,899 --> 00:42:24,526
front of my pants right now, I'm sorry to say.

601
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:27,112
But I'll get her. Relax.

602
00:42:29,365 --> 00:42:30,866
Thanks.

603
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:32,951
- It was a surprise, Mr. Farrell.
- It was.

604
00:42:33,035 --> 00:42:34,077
Sit down.

605
00:42:34,162 --> 00:42:36,079
Did you tell him what I'm doing here?

606
00:42:36,164 --> 00:42:38,999
No, I wanted to save that as a surprise, too.

607
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:40,750
Hang on to your hat, Mr. Farrell...

608
00:42:50,845 --> 00:42:53,096
- Take a walk.
- I gotta change the reel.

609
00:42:53,181 --> 00:42:55,265
I said fuck off!

610
00:43:00,104 --> 00:43:02,898
Ain't you gonna scream?

611
00:43:04,275 --> 00:43:06,067
Let's get this over with.

612
00:43:10,198 --> 00:43:11,823
He broke my fuckin' nose!

613
00:43:22,336 --> 00:43:26,380
Now...I'm gonna open my fly...

614
00:43:26,465 --> 00:43:29,425
and you're gonna swallow
what I give you to swallow.

615
00:43:30,511 --> 00:43:32,303
Then you're gonna swallow Rooster's.

616
00:43:32,387 --> 00:43:35,223
You broke his nose,
he ought to have something to show for it.

617
00:43:35,307 --> 00:43:37,517
Anything you put in my mouth,
you're gonna lose.

618
00:43:37,601 --> 00:43:40,353
No. You don't understand.

619
00:43:40,437 --> 00:43:43,731
You do that, and I'll put
all eight inches of this steel in your ear.

620
00:43:43,732 --> 00:43:44,815
All right.

621
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:49,529
But you should know that sudden, serious brain
injury causes the victim to bite down hard.

622
00:43:50,781 --> 00:43:53,199
In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong,

623
00:43:53,283 --> 00:43:58,079
they have to pry the victim's jaws open...
with a crowbar.

624
00:44:00,916 --> 00:44:02,542
Where did you get this shit?

625
00:44:02,626 --> 00:44:04,293
I read it.

626
00:44:05,379 --> 00:44:08,256
Know how to read, you ignorant fuck?

627
00:44:09,758 --> 00:44:11,634
Honey...

628
00:44:12,886 --> 00:44:15,263
..you shouldn't.

629
00:44:17,307 --> 00:44:20,310
Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth...

630
00:44:20,395 --> 00:44:22,771
and neither did his friends.

631
00:44:22,855 --> 00:44:26,149
What they did do...
is beat him within an inch of his life.

632
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,361
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

633
00:44:30,405 --> 00:44:32,906
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

634
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:38,996
Time's up, Bogs.

635
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:44,751
It's your world, boss.

636
00:44:46,838 --> 00:44:50,257
Return to your cell blocks for evening count.

637
00:44:50,341 --> 00:44:52,509
All prisoners report for lockdown.

638
00:45:08,067 --> 00:45:09,359
What?

639
00:45:21,832 --> 00:45:24,542
Where's he going?
Grab his ankles.

640
00:45:26,128 --> 00:45:28,630
No! No!

641
00:45:28,714 --> 00:45:30,089
No!

642
00:45:30,174 --> 00:45:31,507
Help me...

643
00:45:31,592 --> 00:45:32,884
Aaarghh!

644
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:37,847
Two things never happened again after that.

645
00:45:37,931 --> 00:45:40,767
The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again...

646
00:45:41,977 --> 00:45:44,687
..and Bogs never walked again.

647
00:45:45,814 --> 00:45:49,233
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

648
00:45:49,318 --> 00:45:55,031
To my knowledge, he lived out the rest
of his days drinking his food through a straw.

649
00:45:55,115 --> 00:45:59,786
I'm thinking Andy could use a nice welcome
back when he gets out of the infirmary.

650
00:46:00,913 --> 00:46:04,707
Sounds good to us.
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.

651
00:46:06,085 --> 00:46:08,753
The man likes to play chess.

652
00:46:08,837 --> 00:46:10,922
Let's get him some rocks.

653
00:46:43,331 --> 00:46:45,207
Guys...

654
00:46:45,291 --> 00:46:47,668
I got one. I got one. Look.

655
00:46:50,088 --> 00:46:52,172
Heywood, that isn't soapstone.

656
00:46:52,257 --> 00:46:54,466
And it ain't alabaster, either.

657
00:46:54,551 --> 00:46:56,176
What are you, a fucking geologist?

658
00:46:56,261 --> 00:46:58,303
He's right. It ain't.

659
00:46:58,388 --> 00:46:59,638
Well, what the hell is it?

660
00:46:59,723 --> 00:47:02,266
A horse apple.

661
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:05,477
- Bullshit.
- No, horse shit. Petrified.

662
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:14,738
Oh, Jesus Christ!

663
00:47:14,822 --> 00:47:16,781
Oh, damn!

664
00:47:16,866 --> 00:47:20,827
Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

665
00:47:22,037 --> 00:47:24,664
And by the weekend he was due back,
we had enough rocks

666
00:47:24,749 --> 00:47:27,792
to keep him busy till rapture.

667
00:47:27,877 --> 00:47:30,587
I also got a big shipment in that week.

668
00:47:30,671 --> 00:47:33,214
Cigarettes. Chewing gum.

669
00:47:33,299 --> 00:47:34,799
Sipping whisky.

670
00:47:34,884 --> 00:47:38,428
Playing cards with naked ladies on them.
You name it.

671
00:47:38,512 --> 00:47:41,473
And of course, the most important item.

672
00:47:43,225 --> 00:47:45,310
Rita Hayworth herself.

673
00:48:19,471 --> 00:48:22,306
OK, look alive! Open all tiers.

674
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:24,725
Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

675
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:27,061
Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

676
00:48:29,189 --> 00:48:31,065
119.

677
00:48:32,567 --> 00:48:34,235
123.

678
00:48:43,703 --> 00:48:45,579
On your feet.

679
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:49,166
Face the wall.

680
00:49:23,661 --> 00:49:25,745
Turn around and face the Warden.

681
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,545
Pleased to see you reading this.

682
00:49:34,922 --> 00:49:37,215
Any favorite passages?

683
00:49:38,259 --> 00:49:43,388
"Watch ye, therefore, for ye know not
when the master of the house cometh."

684
00:49:44,432 --> 00:49:47,309
Mark 13:35.

685
00:49:47,393 --> 00:49:50,061
I always liked that one.

686
00:49:50,146 --> 00:49:51,646
But I prefer...

687
00:49:51,731 --> 00:49:54,482
"I'm the light of the world.

688
00:49:54,567 --> 00:49:58,111
He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness,
but shall have the light of life."

689
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:00,780
John, Chapter 8, Verse 12.

690
00:50:00,865 --> 00:50:04,326
I hear you're good with numbers. How nice.

691
00:50:05,453 --> 00:50:07,537
A man should have a skill.

692
00:50:09,625 --> 00:50:11,083
Wanna explain this?

693
00:50:12,169 --> 00:50:15,630
It's called a rock blanket.
It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

694
00:50:16,673 --> 00:50:18,633
A little hobby of mine.

695
00:50:29,478 --> 00:50:32,480
It's pretty clean. Some contraband here,

696
00:50:32,564 --> 00:50:34,649
but nothing to get in a twist over.

697
00:50:38,487 --> 00:50:40,571
I can't say I approve of this.

698
00:50:42,074 --> 00:50:43,783
But I suppose...

699
00:50:45,744 --> 00:50:47,620
..exceptions can be made.

700
00:50:58,006 --> 00:51:00,299
Lock 'em up!

701
00:51:02,302 --> 00:51:04,261
I almost forgot.

702
00:51:04,346 --> 00:51:06,598
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

703
00:51:06,683 --> 00:51:08,141
Salvation lies within.

704
00:51:09,227 --> 00:51:10,560
Yes, sir.

705
00:51:18,861 --> 00:51:21,446
Tossing cells was just an excuse.

706
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:25,575
The truth is, Norton wanted to size Andy up.

707
00:51:39,215 --> 00:51:42,342
My wife made that in church group.

708
00:51:44,679 --> 00:51:46,013
Very nice, sir.

709
00:51:47,181 --> 00:51:49,057
Do you enjoy working in the laundry?

710
00:51:50,685 --> 00:51:52,394
No, sir, not especially.

711
00:51:52,478 --> 00:51:55,272
Perhaps we can find something more...

712
00:51:55,356 --> 00:51:57,441
befitting a man of your education.

713
00:52:05,784 --> 00:52:07,452
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?

714
00:52:07,536 --> 00:52:08,828
Andy.

715
00:52:08,912 --> 00:52:11,205
I thought I heard you out here!

716
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:14,292
I've been reassigned to you.

717
00:52:14,376 --> 00:52:17,545
I know. They told me.

718
00:52:17,629 --> 00:52:19,714
Ain't that a kick in the head?

719
00:52:19,798 --> 00:52:22,300
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

720
00:52:22,384 --> 00:52:24,469
Come on.

721
00:52:24,553 --> 00:52:26,721
Well, here she is.

722
00:52:26,805 --> 00:52:29,348
Shawshank Prison library.

723
00:52:29,433 --> 00:52:32,310
National Geographics.

724
00:52:32,394 --> 00:52:35,229
Reader's Digest condensed books.

725
00:52:35,314 --> 00:52:37,607
Louis L'Amour.

726
00:52:37,608 --> 00:52:39,734
Look Magazine.

727
00:52:39,818 --> 00:52:42,320
Erle Stanley Gardners.

728
00:52:42,404 --> 00:52:45,948
Every evening,
I load up the cart and make my round.

729
00:52:45,949 --> 00:52:49,118
I enter the names on this clipboard here.

730
00:52:49,203 --> 00:52:52,663
Easy-peasy, Japanesey. Any questions?

731
00:52:52,748 --> 00:52:55,708
Brooks, how long have you been librarian?

732
00:52:55,793 --> 00:53:00,963
Oh...I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

733
00:53:01,048 --> 00:53:04,426
And in all that time,
have you ever had an assistant?

734
00:53:04,511 --> 00:53:07,096
No. No, not much to it, really.

735
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:09,098
Well, why me? Why now?

736
00:53:09,182 --> 00:53:10,682
I don't know,

737
00:53:10,767 --> 00:53:14,103
but it'll be nice to have some company
down here for a change.

738
00:53:14,104 --> 00:53:16,188
Dufresne!

739
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:27,574
That's him. That's the one.

740
00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:36,416
I'm Dekins.

741
00:53:36,501 --> 00:53:38,961
I was er...

742
00:53:39,045 --> 00:53:43,048
thinking about maybe setting up
some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.

743
00:53:45,385 --> 00:53:46,844
Oh...

744
00:53:46,928 --> 00:53:48,595
I see.

745
00:53:50,056 --> 00:53:51,932
Well, erm...

746
00:53:53,309 --> 00:53:54,852
..why don't we have a seat,

747
00:53:54,936 --> 00:53:57,020
and talk it over?

748
00:53:59,566 --> 00:54:02,485
Brooks,
do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?

749
00:54:13,956 --> 00:54:15,665
Thanks.

750
00:54:15,749 --> 00:54:17,417
So...

751
00:54:18,669 --> 00:54:21,171
Mr. Dekins...

752
00:54:21,255 --> 00:54:25,717
And then Andy says to Mr. Dekins,
"Do you want your sons to go to Harvard,

753
00:54:25,801 --> 00:54:27,927
- or Yale?"
- He didn't say that?

754
00:54:28,012 --> 00:54:30,680
As God is my witness, he did!

755
00:54:30,764 --> 00:54:34,142
Dekins just blinked for a second.
Then he laughed himself silly.

756
00:54:34,226 --> 00:54:36,102
And afterwards he shook Andy's hand.

757
00:54:36,187 --> 00:54:37,562
My ass!

758
00:54:37,646 --> 00:54:38,855
Shook his hand.

759
00:54:38,939 --> 00:54:41,900
Hell, I...I near soiled myself!

760
00:54:41,984 --> 00:54:46,196
All Andy needed was a suit and a tie
and a little jiggly hula girl on his desk,

761
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,614
and he would have been:

762
00:54:47,698 --> 00:54:49,240
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please"!

763
00:54:49,325 --> 00:54:51,075
Making a few friends, Andy?

764
00:54:52,119 --> 00:54:54,078
I wouldn't say "friends".

765
00:54:54,163 --> 00:54:58,167
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

766
00:54:58,251 --> 00:55:00,586
It's a wonderful pet to have.

767
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:02,588
Got you out of the laundry, though.

768
00:55:02,672 --> 00:55:04,882
Well, it might do more than that.

769
00:55:04,966 --> 00:55:07,968
How about expanding the library?
Get some new books in there.

770
00:55:08,053 --> 00:55:10,763
If you're gonna ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

771
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:13,307
- Right.
- How do you expect to do that?

772
00:55:13,391 --> 00:55:18,646
I mean, get new books in here,
Mr. Dufresne, if you please?

773
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:20,481
Ask the Warden for funds.

774
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,194
Son, son. Six wardens
have been through here in my tenure,

775
00:55:25,278 --> 00:55:28,906
and I've learned one immutable, universal truth.

776
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:30,699
Not one of them born...

777
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:35,663
whose asshole wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you asked them for funds.

778
00:55:35,747 --> 00:55:38,040
The budget's stretched thin, as it is.

779
00:55:38,124 --> 00:55:39,375
I see.

780
00:55:39,459 --> 00:55:43,003
Perhaps I could write to the State Senate
and request funds from them.

781
00:55:43,088 --> 00:55:47,466
As far as they're concerned, there's only three
ways to spend money when it comes to prisons:

782
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:49,635
more walls, more bars and more guards.

783
00:55:49,719 --> 00:55:54,139
Still, I'd like to try, with your permission.
A letter a week. They can't ignore me forever.

784
00:55:54,224 --> 00:55:55,766
Sure can.

785
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:58,728
But you write your letters,
if it makes you happy.

786
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:01,106
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

787
00:56:03,025 --> 00:56:06,069
So, Andy started writing a letter a week,

788
00:56:06,153 --> 00:56:08,238
just like he said.

789
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:16,413
And, just like Norton said, Andy got no answers.

790
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:29,759
The following April, Andy did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

791
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:32,929
The year after that, he did them all...

792
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:35,098
including the Warden's.

793
00:56:36,475 --> 00:56:40,228
The year after that, they rescheduled
the start of the intramural season

794
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:42,397
to coincide with tax season.

795
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:48,903
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

796
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:53,116
So, Moresby Prison issued you your gun,
but you had to pay for it?

797
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,952
Damn right. The holster, too.

798
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:56,287
That's tax-deductible.

799
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:57,538
You can write that off.

800
00:56:57,622 --> 00:57:00,958
Yes, sir.
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

801
00:57:01,043 --> 00:57:04,086
In fact, it got so busy at tax time...

802
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:06,213
he was allowed a staff.

803
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:08,758
Hey, Red, can you hand me a stack of 1040s?

804
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:11,510
It got me out of the wood shop
a month out of the year,

805
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:14,263
and that was fine by me.

806
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:17,725
And still...he kept sending those letters.

807
00:57:23,023 --> 00:57:24,857
Red, Andy.

808
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,150
It's Brooks.

809
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,694
Watch the door.

810
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:30,363
Please, Brooks.

811
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,448
- Just calm the fuck down.
- Stay back!

812
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,575
- Stay back!
- What the hell's going on?

813
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:37,745
You tell me. One second he's fine.
Then out comes the knife.

814
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:40,289
Brooks, we can talk about this. Right?

815
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:42,500
Nothing to talk about, goddamn it!

816
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,293
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.

817
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:46,253
Heywood? Wait, what's he done to you?

818
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:48,464
It's what they done!

819
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:49,965
I...I got no choice...

820
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,719
You're not gonna hurt him.
Even Heywood knows that.

821
00:57:52,804 --> 00:57:55,430
- Right, Heywood?
- I...I know that, sure.

822
00:57:55,515 --> 00:57:58,934
You won't hurt him, because he's a friend,
and you're a reasonable man.

823
00:57:59,018 --> 00:58:00,310
That's right. Right, guys?

824
00:58:00,395 --> 00:58:03,772
- Yes.
- So, put the knife down. Brooks, look at me.

825
00:58:03,856 --> 00:58:05,690
Put the knife down.

826
00:58:06,776 --> 00:58:07,943
Brooks...

827
00:58:08,027 --> 00:58:10,278
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

828
00:58:10,363 --> 00:58:12,697
Brooks, look at his neck. It's bleeding.

829
00:58:14,033 --> 00:58:15,617
It's the only...

830
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:17,994
It's the only way they'd let me stay.

831
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:20,664
Come on. This is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

832
00:58:20,665 --> 00:58:22,749
Put it down.

833
00:58:30,133 --> 00:58:34,845
Come on. Take it easy.
You're going to be all right.

834
00:58:34,929 --> 00:58:36,304
Him?

835
00:58:36,389 --> 00:58:40,058
Hell, what about me?
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat.

836
00:58:40,143 --> 00:58:42,769
Shit, Heywood,
you've had worse from shaving.

837
00:58:42,854 --> 00:58:45,105
What the hell did you do to set him off, anyway?

838
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:47,524
Nothing. I come in here to say fare-thee-well.

839
00:58:47,608 --> 00:58:50,736
Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.

840
00:58:52,781 --> 00:58:55,908
I just don't understand what happened in there.
That's all.

841
00:58:55,993 --> 00:58:58,578
The old man's as crazy
as a rat in a tin shithouse.

842
00:58:58,662 --> 00:59:00,872
Oh, Heywood, that's enough out of you.

843
00:59:00,956 --> 00:59:03,958
- I heard he had you shitting in your pants.
- Fuck you!

844
00:59:04,042 --> 00:59:05,418
Would you knock it off?

845
00:59:05,502 --> 00:59:07,837
Brooks ain't no bug.

846
00:59:07,921 --> 00:59:09,797
He's just...

847
00:59:11,675 --> 00:59:13,509
He's just institutionalized.

848
00:59:14,845 --> 00:59:16,512
Institutionalized, my ass.

849
00:59:16,597 --> 00:59:20,892
The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood.
50 years.

850
00:59:20,976 --> 00:59:22,685
This is all he knows.

851
00:59:22,769 --> 00:59:25,188
In here, he's an important man.

852
00:59:25,272 --> 00:59:26,731
He's an educated man.

853
00:59:26,815 --> 00:59:28,900
Outside, he's nothing.

854
00:59:31,069 --> 00:59:33,696
Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.

855
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,991
Probably couldn't get a
library card if he tried.

856
00:59:37,075 --> 00:59:39,160
You know what I'm trying to say?

857
00:59:39,244 --> 00:59:41,996
Red, I do believe you're
talking out of your ass.

858
00:59:43,248 --> 00:59:46,167
You believe whatever you want, Floyd.

859
00:59:46,168 --> 00:59:48,712
But I'm telling you, these walls are funny.

860
00:59:50,131 --> 00:59:52,216
First you hate 'em...

861
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,844
..then you get used to 'em.

862
00:59:57,472 --> 01:00:00,098
Enough time passes...

863
01:00:00,183 --> 01:00:03,143
you get so you depend on 'em.

864
01:00:03,228 --> 01:00:05,562
That's institutionalized.

865
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:07,022
Shit.

866
01:00:07,023 --> 01:00:08,649
You can never get like that.

867
01:00:08,733 --> 01:00:10,651
Oh, yeah?

868
01:00:10,735 --> 01:00:13,320
Say that when you've been here
as long as Brooks has.

869
01:00:13,404 --> 01:00:15,280
Goddamn right.

870
01:00:17,617 --> 01:00:20,160
They send you here for life.

871
01:00:20,245 --> 01:00:22,329
That's exactly what they take.

872
01:00:24,249 --> 01:00:26,333
The part that counts, anyway.

873
01:00:33,841 --> 01:00:36,009
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

874
01:00:37,929 --> 01:00:39,763
You go on, now.

875
01:00:40,848 --> 01:00:45,519
You're free.

876
01:01:01,412 --> 01:01:03,288
Bye.

877
01:01:04,373 --> 01:01:06,291
Good luck, Brooks.

878
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:45,581
Dear fellas...

879
01:01:45,665 --> 01:01:49,877
I can't believe
how fast things move on the outside.

880
01:01:51,296 --> 01:01:54,340
Watch it, old-timer! Are
you trying to get killed?

881
01:01:54,424 --> 01:01:57,760
I saw an automobile once, when I was a kid,

882
01:01:57,844 --> 01:02:00,763
but now...they're everywhere.

883
01:02:04,976 --> 01:02:08,562
The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

884
01:02:24,913 --> 01:02:31,210
The parole board got me into
this halfway house called The Brewer,

885
01:02:31,294 --> 01:02:35,089
and a job bagging groceries at the Foodway.

886
01:02:37,133 --> 01:02:42,471
It's hard work, and I try to keep up,
but my hands hurt most of the time.

887
01:02:42,556 --> 01:02:44,557
Make sure your man double-bags.

888
01:02:44,642 --> 01:02:46,893
Last time, the bottom near came out.

889
01:02:46,977 --> 01:02:50,271
Make sure you double-bag, like the lady says.
Understand?

890
01:02:50,356 --> 01:02:51,815
Yes, sir. I surely will.

891
01:02:51,899 --> 01:02:55,694
I don't think
the store manager likes me very much.

892
01:02:58,656 --> 01:03:03,451
Sometimes, after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

893
01:03:03,536 --> 01:03:08,873
I keep thinking Jake might just show up
and say hello.

894
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:10,750
But he never does.

895
01:03:11,836 --> 01:03:17,215
And I hope, wherever he is,
he's doing OK and making new friends.

896
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,638
I have trouble sleeping at night.

897
01:03:23,723 --> 01:03:26,516
I have bad dreams, like I'm falling.

898
01:03:27,601 --> 01:03:29,519
I wake up, scared.

899
01:03:29,603 --> 01:03:33,606
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

900
01:03:35,234 --> 01:03:36,693
Maybe I should get me a gun

901
01:03:36,777 --> 01:03:40,656
and rob the Foodway, so they'd send me home.

902
01:03:40,741 --> 01:03:43,075
I could shoot the manager, while I was at it.

903
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,119
Sort of like a bonus.

904
01:03:46,621 --> 01:03:50,875
I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense
any more.

905
01:03:50,959 --> 01:03:53,002
I don't like it here.

906
01:03:53,086 --> 01:03:55,755
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.

907
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:56,922
I've decided...

908
01:03:57,007 --> 01:03:58,883
not to stay.

909
01:04:10,228 --> 01:04:13,731
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.

910
01:04:13,815 --> 01:04:15,900
Not for an old crook like me.

911
01:05:18,923 --> 01:05:22,968
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.
Not for an old crook like me.

912
01:05:24,136 --> 01:05:28,181
PS. Tell Heywood
I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat.

913
01:05:28,182 --> 01:05:30,267
No hard feelings. Brooks."

914
01:05:40,988 --> 01:05:43,072
He should have died in here.

915
01:05:48,495 --> 01:05:52,957
What the fuck have you done?
It's a goddamn mess. I'll tell you that.

916
01:05:57,671 --> 01:05:59,088
What's all this?

917
01:05:59,172 --> 01:06:03,050
You tell me, fuck-stick.
They're all addressed to you.

918
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,427
Take it.

919
01:06:13,395 --> 01:06:14,979
"Dear Mr. Dufresne...

920
01:06:16,064 --> 01:06:18,065
In response to your repeated enquiries,

921
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:22,862
the State has allocated the enclosed funds
for your library project."

922
01:06:22,946 --> 01:06:24,322
This is 200 dollars.

923
01:06:25,365 --> 01:06:29,285
"In addition, the Library District
has generously responded

924
01:06:29,369 --> 01:06:32,079
with a charitable donation
of used books and sundries.

925
01:06:32,164 --> 01:06:34,248
We trust this will fill your needs.

926
01:06:34,333 --> 01:06:38,462
We now consider the matter closed.
Please stop sending us letters."

927
01:06:38,546 --> 01:06:41,381
I want all this cleared out
before the Warden gets back.

928
01:06:41,466 --> 01:06:43,133
Yes, sir.

929
01:06:46,888 --> 01:06:48,263
Good for you, Andy.

930
01:06:50,892 --> 01:06:52,351
Wow!

931
01:06:53,436 --> 01:06:55,520
It only took six years.

932
01:06:56,814 --> 01:06:59,691
From now on,
I'll write two letters a week, instead of one.

933
01:06:59,776 --> 01:07:03,320
Oh, I believe you're crazy enough.
You'd better get all this stuff out,

934
01:07:03,404 --> 01:07:04,571
like the Captain said.

935
01:07:04,656 --> 01:07:08,533
Now, I'm gonna go pinch a loaf.
When I come back, this is all gone, right?

936
01:07:14,707 --> 01:07:16,708
Wow.

937
01:07:46,782 --> 01:07:49,492
Duettino from The Marriage Of Figaro

938
01:07:50,953 --> 01:07:53,538
? Sull'aria...

939
01:07:57,167 --> 01:07:58,167
Andy,

940
01:07:58,252 --> 01:07:59,585
do you hear that?

941
01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:03,381
?..zeffiretto

942
01:08:15,602 --> 01:08:23,443
? Questa será spirera

943
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:58,145
? Sotto i pini

944
01:08:58,229 --> 01:09:03,442
? Del boschetto

945
01:09:04,944 --> 01:09:07,321
? Sotto i pini...

946
01:09:07,405 --> 01:09:10,282
Dufresne?

947
01:09:10,366 --> 01:09:11,950
Dufresne?

948
01:09:12,035 --> 01:09:14,119
Andy, let me out.

949
01:09:16,831 --> 01:09:20,375
Andy?

950
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:25,631
I have no idea to this day what those
two Italian ladies were singing about.

951
01:09:25,715 --> 01:09:28,133
The truth is, I don't want to know.

952
01:09:28,218 --> 01:09:30,303
Some things are best left unsaid.

953
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:36,872
I like to think they were
singing about something

954
01:09:36,873 --> 01:09:39,395
so beautiful, it can't be expressed in words...

955
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:41,856
and makes your heart ache because of it.

956
01:09:44,068 --> 01:09:46,778
I tell you, those voices soared...

957
01:09:46,862 --> 01:09:51,407
higher and farther
than anybody in a grey place dares to dream.

958
01:09:51,492 --> 01:09:54,869
It was like some beautiful bird
flapped into our drab little cage

959
01:09:54,954 --> 01:09:58,081
and made those walls dissolve away.

960
01:09:58,165 --> 01:10:00,500
And for the briefest of moments...

961
01:10:00,584 --> 01:10:03,670
every last man at Shawshank felt free.

962
01:10:06,173 --> 01:10:08,675
It pissed the Warden off something awful.

963
01:10:10,094 --> 01:10:11,219
Open the door.

964
01:10:13,973 --> 01:10:15,890
Open it up!

965
01:10:17,101 --> 01:10:19,477
Dufresne, open this door!

966
01:10:21,105 --> 01:10:22,438
Turn that off!

967
01:10:29,239 --> 01:10:31,991
I am warning you, Dufresne. Turn that off!

968
01:10:45,839 --> 01:10:47,715
Dufresne...

969
01:10:48,842 --> 01:10:50,926
You're mine now.

970
01:10:58,476 --> 01:11:01,228
Andy got two weeks in the hole
for that little stunt.

971
01:11:01,313 --> 01:11:03,731
On your feet!

972
01:11:04,941 --> 01:11:07,026
- Hey, look who's here.
- Maestro!

973
01:11:08,528 --> 01:11:12,573
Y- Y-You couldn't play something good, huh?
Hank Williams or something?

974
01:11:12,657 --> 01:11:15,326
They broke the door down
before I could take requests.

975
01:11:15,410 --> 01:11:17,203
Was it worth it, two weeks in the hole?

976
01:11:17,287 --> 01:11:18,537
Easiest time I ever did.

977
01:11:18,622 --> 01:11:21,665
Bullshit!
There's no such thing as easy time in the hole.

978
01:11:21,666 --> 01:11:24,293
A week in the hole is like a year.

979
01:11:24,377 --> 01:11:27,088
I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

980
01:11:27,173 --> 01:11:30,508
So, they let you tote that record player
down there, huh?

981
01:11:32,637 --> 01:11:34,262
It was in here.

982
01:11:34,347 --> 01:11:36,014
And in here.

983
01:11:37,225 --> 01:11:41,478
That's the beauty of music.
They can't get that from you.

984
01:11:45,399 --> 01:11:47,901
Haven't you ever felt that way about music?

985
01:11:49,570 --> 01:11:53,657
Well, I played a mean harmonica,
as a younger man.

986
01:11:53,741 --> 01:11:55,533
Lost interest in it, though.

987
01:11:55,618 --> 01:11:57,452
Didn't make much sense in here.

988
01:11:57,536 --> 01:11:59,996
Here's where it makes the most sense.

989
01:12:00,081 --> 01:12:02,666
You need it, so you don't forget.

990
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:04,084
Forget?

991
01:12:04,168 --> 01:12:06,127
Forget that...

992
01:12:06,212 --> 01:12:08,296
there are places...

993
01:12:09,632 --> 01:12:12,175
..in the world that aren't made out of stone...

994
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:14,302
that there's a...

995
01:12:14,387 --> 01:12:16,221
there's something...

996
01:12:16,305 --> 01:12:19,099
inside that they can't get to...

997
01:12:19,183 --> 01:12:21,476
that they can't touch.

998
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,437
It's yours.

999
01:12:24,856 --> 01:12:26,565
What are you talking about?

1000
01:12:27,651 --> 01:12:29,235
Hope.

1001
01:12:29,319 --> 01:12:31,195
Hope?

1002
01:12:33,031 --> 01:12:35,700
Let me tell you something, my friend.

1003
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:37,743
Hope is a dangerous thing.

1004
01:12:39,329 --> 01:12:41,372
Hope can drive a man insane.

1005
01:12:42,416 --> 01:12:44,333
It's got no use on the inside.

1006
01:12:44,418 --> 01:12:47,086
You'd better get used to that idea.

1007
01:12:49,506 --> 01:12:51,132
Like Brooks did?

1008
01:13:16,366 --> 01:13:17,408
Sit down.

1009
01:13:22,623 --> 01:13:26,084
It says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

1010
01:13:26,169 --> 01:13:28,795
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1011
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,964
Oh, yes, sir.

1012
01:13:30,965 --> 01:13:33,050
Without a doubt.

1013
01:13:34,093 --> 01:13:36,428
And I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

1014
01:13:39,015 --> 01:13:41,058
No danger to society here.

1015
01:13:41,142 --> 01:13:43,226
God's honest truth.

1016
01:13:45,563 --> 01:13:47,647
Absolutely rehabilitated.

1017
01:13:57,575 --> 01:13:59,659
30 years.

1018
01:14:00,745 --> 01:14:02,788
Jesus, when they say it like that...

1019
01:14:02,872 --> 01:14:04,956
You wonder where it went.

1020
01:14:07,919 --> 01:14:10,003
I wonder where ten years went.

1021
01:14:15,051 --> 01:14:16,343
Here.

1022
01:14:16,427 --> 01:14:18,595
Little parole rejection present.

1023
01:14:20,432 --> 01:14:22,475
Go ahead and open it.

1024
01:14:22,559 --> 01:14:26,354
I had to go through one of your competitors.
I hope you don't mind.

1025
01:14:26,438 --> 01:14:28,523
I wanted it to be a surprise.

1026
01:14:38,659 --> 01:14:40,743
It's very pretty, Andy.

1027
01:14:41,829 --> 01:14:43,913
Thank you.

1028
01:14:45,666 --> 01:14:47,750
Are you going to play it?

1029
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,965
No.

1030
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:58,344
Not right now.

1031
01:15:05,602 --> 01:15:07,687
Tier 3 South. Clear.

1032
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:10,773
Tier 4 North. Clear.

1033
01:15:10,858 --> 01:15:12,942
Tier 1 South. Clear.

1034
01:15:15,779 --> 01:15:17,865
Fall in!

1035
01:15:52,442 --> 01:15:54,026
Lights out!

1036
01:16:28,938 --> 01:16:30,980
Andy was as good as his word.

1037
01:16:31,065 --> 01:16:33,566
He wrote two letters a week instead of one.

1038
01:16:36,195 --> 01:16:40,323
In 1959, the State Senate
finally clued into the fact

1039
01:16:40,407 --> 01:16:43,284
they couldn't buy him off
with just a $200 check.

1040
01:16:43,369 --> 01:16:49,958
Appropriations Committee voted
an annual payment of $500 just to shut him up.

1041
01:16:50,042 --> 01:16:51,751
And you'd be amazed

1042
01:16:51,835 --> 01:16:53,503
how far Andy could stretch it.

1043
01:16:53,587 --> 01:16:56,464
He made deals with book clubs, charity groups.

1044
01:16:56,549 --> 01:16:58,925
He bought remaindered books by the pound.

1045
01:16:59,009 --> 01:17:01,219
Treasure Island.

1046
01:17:01,303 --> 01:17:03,471
Robert Louis...

1047
01:17:03,556 --> 01:17:04,764
..Stevenson.

1048
01:17:04,848 --> 01:17:06,307
Fiction, adventure.

1049
01:17:08,310 --> 01:17:09,936
What's next?

1050
01:17:09,937 --> 01:17:12,647
I got here Auto Repair and...

1051
01:17:13,692 --> 01:17:15,025
..Soap Carving.

1052
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:18,487
Trade skills and hobbies. Goes under
Educational. The stack behind you.

1053
01:17:18,572 --> 01:17:20,614
The Count Of Monte Crisco.

1054
01:17:20,699 --> 01:17:23,033
That's Cristo, you dumb shit.

1055
01:17:23,118 --> 01:17:26,912
By Alexandree...Dumass.

1056
01:17:26,997 --> 01:17:31,917
Dumb-ass?

1057
01:17:34,421 --> 01:17:36,755
Dumas. You know what that's about?

1058
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,215
Uh-uh.

1059
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:41,010
You'll like it. It's about a prison break.

1060
01:17:41,094 --> 01:17:45,097
We ought to file that under Educational, too,
oughtn't we?

1061
01:17:45,181 --> 01:17:49,351
The rest of us did our best to pitch in
when and where we could.

1062
01:17:50,604 --> 01:17:52,438
By the year Kennedy was shot,

1063
01:17:52,522 --> 01:17:56,859
Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of rat turds and turpentine

1064
01:17:56,860 --> 01:18:00,195
into the best prison library in New England,

1065
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:04,158
complete with a fine selection of Hank Williams.

1066
01:18:04,242 --> 01:18:08,412
? Lawd I don't know what I'll do-ooo

1067
01:18:08,496 --> 01:18:11,248
? All I do is sit and sigh...

1068
01:18:11,333 --> 01:18:16,087
That was also the year Warden Norton
instituted his famous Inside Out program.

1069
01:18:16,172 --> 01:18:18,882
You may remember reading about it.

1070
01:18:18,966 --> 01:18:22,385
It made all the papers
and got his picture in Look Magazine.

1071
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:24,137
No free ride.

1072
01:18:24,221 --> 01:18:27,182
But rather a genuine, progressive advance

1073
01:18:27,266 --> 01:18:29,434
in corrections and rehabilitation.

1074
01:18:30,478 --> 01:18:32,812
Our inmates, properly supervised,

1075
01:18:32,897 --> 01:18:35,649
will be put to work outside these walls,

1076
01:18:35,733 --> 01:18:37,817
performing all manner of public service.

1077
01:18:37,902 --> 01:18:41,821
These men can learn
the value of an honest day's labor,

1078
01:18:41,906 --> 01:18:45,575
while providing a valuable service
to the community and...

1079
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:50,872
at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q Taxpayer.

1080
01:18:50,956 --> 01:18:53,625
Of course,
Norton failed to mention to the press

1081
01:18:53,709 --> 01:18:57,003
that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.

1082
01:18:57,088 --> 01:19:00,256
There are a hundred different ways
to skim off the top.

1083
01:19:00,341 --> 01:19:02,967
Men, materials, you name it.

1084
01:19:04,011 --> 01:19:06,763
And, oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in.

1085
01:19:06,847 --> 01:19:08,973
If this keeps up, you'll put me out of business.

1086
01:19:09,058 --> 01:19:11,227
- Ned!
- This pool of slave labor you've got,

1087
01:19:11,311 --> 01:19:13,354
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1088
01:19:13,438 --> 01:19:17,400
Ned, we're providing
a valuable community service here.

1089
01:19:17,484 --> 01:19:19,735
Well, that's fine for the papers

1090
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:21,320
but I've got a family to feed.

1091
01:19:21,405 --> 01:19:23,114
Sam...

1092
01:19:23,198 --> 01:19:25,658
Sam, we go back a long way.

1093
01:19:25,742 --> 01:19:28,077
I need this new highway contract.

1094
01:19:28,161 --> 01:19:30,371
I don't get it, and I go under.

1095
01:19:30,455 --> 01:19:32,498
That's a fact.

1096
01:19:32,582 --> 01:19:34,667
You just have some of this fine pie

1097
01:19:34,751 --> 01:19:36,794
my missus made especially for you,

1098
01:19:36,878 --> 01:19:38,212
and you think about that.

1099
01:19:46,263 --> 01:19:49,181
Ned, I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

1100
01:19:49,266 --> 01:19:52,476
It seems to me I already got
my boys committed elsewhere.

1101
01:19:54,354 --> 01:19:56,939
You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.

1102
01:19:58,567 --> 01:20:00,735
And behind every shady deal,

1103
01:20:00,819 --> 01:20:03,028
behind every dollar earned,

1104
01:20:03,113 --> 01:20:06,282
there was Andy, keeping the books.

1105
01:20:07,325 --> 01:20:10,746
Two deposits.
Maine National and New England First.

1106
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:12,914
Night drops as always, sir.

1107
01:20:43,321 --> 01:20:45,071
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1108
01:20:45,156 --> 01:20:47,949
- Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.
- Yes, sir.

1109
01:20:48,034 --> 01:20:51,787
Tell them if they over-starch my shirts again,
they'll hear about it from me.

1110
01:20:51,871 --> 01:20:53,872
How do I look?

1111
01:20:53,956 --> 01:20:56,666
- Very nice, sir.
- Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1112
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:58,460
The Governor's going to be there.

1113
01:20:59,879 --> 01:21:01,922
Want the rest of this?

1114
01:21:02,006 --> 01:21:04,090
The woman can't bake worth shit.

1115
01:21:05,468 --> 01:21:07,261
Thank you, sir.

1116
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:13,184
- He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, I hear.
- What you hear isn't half of it.

1117
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:15,728
He's got scams you haven't even dreamed of.

1118
01:21:15,813 --> 01:21:17,855
Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1119
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:20,817
There's a river of dirty money
running through this place.

1120
01:21:20,901 --> 01:21:24,153
But the problem with having all that money
is you'll have to explain

1121
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:26,823
- where it came from.
- That's where I come in.

1122
01:21:26,907 --> 01:21:29,408
I channel it, filter it, funnel it.

1123
01:21:29,493 --> 01:21:32,036
Stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.

1124
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,789
I send that money out into the real world.

1125
01:21:34,873 --> 01:21:38,501
- And when it comes back...
- Clean as a virgin's honey pot, huh?

1126
01:21:38,585 --> 01:21:39,794
Cleaner.

1127
01:21:39,878 --> 01:21:43,506
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1128
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:50,680
If they ever catch on, though, he's gonna
wind up in here wearing a number himself.

1129
01:21:50,764 --> 01:21:54,016
Now, Red, I thought you had
a little more faith in me than that.

1130
01:21:54,101 --> 01:21:57,395
I know you're good, Andy,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1131
01:21:57,479 --> 01:22:00,481
Now, anybody gets curious,
the FBI, the IRS, whatever,

1132
01:22:00,566 --> 01:22:03,401
it's gonna lead to somebody.

1133
01:22:03,485 --> 01:22:05,445
Sure it is. But not to me.

1134
01:22:05,530 --> 01:22:07,531
And certainly not to the Warden.

1135
01:22:11,578 --> 01:22:12,870
All right. Who?

1136
01:22:12,954 --> 01:22:14,663
Randall Stevens.

1137
01:22:14,747 --> 01:22:15,914
Who?

1138
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,712
The silent silent partner. He's the guilty one,
Your Honor. The man with the bank accounts.

1139
01:22:21,796 --> 01:22:23,964
That's where the filtering process starts.

1140
01:22:24,048 --> 01:22:27,217
If they trace anything,
it's just going to lead to him.

1141
01:22:27,302 --> 01:22:28,886
But who is he?

1142
01:22:28,970 --> 01:22:31,013
He's a phantom, an apparition.

1143
01:22:31,097 --> 01:22:33,056
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1144
01:22:33,141 --> 01:22:35,309
I conjured him...

1145
01:22:35,393 --> 01:22:37,436
out of thin air.

1146
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,355
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1147
01:22:43,484 --> 01:22:45,861
Andy, you canâ€™t just make a person up.

1148
01:22:45,945 --> 01:22:49,072
Sure you can, if you know how
the system works, where the cracks are.

1149
01:22:49,157 --> 01:22:52,659
It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.

1150
01:22:52,744 --> 01:22:55,370
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate,

1151
01:22:55,455 --> 01:22:57,789
a driver's license, social security number.

1152
01:22:57,874 --> 01:22:59,082
You're shitting me?

1153
01:22:59,167 --> 01:23:01,126
If they ever trace any of those accounts,

1154
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:04,088
they're going to wind up chasing
a figment of my imagination.

1155
01:23:04,173 --> 01:23:06,257
Well, I'll be damned.

1156
01:23:07,551 --> 01:23:09,594
Did I say you were good?

1157
01:23:09,678 --> 01:23:11,846
Shit, you're a Rembrandt!

1158
01:23:11,931 --> 01:23:13,973
You know, the funny thing is,

1159
01:23:14,058 --> 01:23:18,019
on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

1160
01:23:19,063 --> 01:23:21,439
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1161
01:23:30,199 --> 01:23:31,574
Ever bother you?

1162
01:23:32,618 --> 01:23:36,037
I don't run the scams, Red,
I just process the profits.

1163
01:23:36,121 --> 01:23:38,164
Fine line maybe but...

1164
01:23:38,248 --> 01:23:40,959
I also built that library

1165
01:23:41,043 --> 01:23:43,670
and used it to help a dozen guys
get a high school diploma.

1166
01:23:43,754 --> 01:23:45,630
Why do you think the Warden lets me do it?

1167
01:23:45,714 --> 01:23:48,466
To keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1168
01:23:48,550 --> 01:23:50,677
Money instead of sheets.

1169
01:23:50,761 --> 01:23:53,471
Well, I work cheap. That's the trade-off.

1170
01:23:59,061 --> 01:24:01,271
Willy And The Hand Jive

1171
01:24:09,072 --> 01:24:10,864
? I know a cat named...

1172
01:24:10,949 --> 01:24:13,617
Tommy Williams
came to Shawshank in 1965

1173
01:24:13,702 --> 01:24:15,744
on a two-year stretch for B&E.

1174
01:24:15,829 --> 01:24:17,955
That's breaking and entering to you.

1175
01:24:18,039 --> 01:24:22,668
The cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.

1176
01:24:22,752 --> 01:24:24,503
Young punk.

1177
01:24:24,587 --> 01:24:26,630
Mr. Rock'n'roll.

1178
01:24:26,715 --> 01:24:28,382
Cocky as hell.

1179
01:24:28,466 --> 01:24:31,051
Hey, come on, old boys! Moving like molasses!

1180
01:24:31,136 --> 01:24:33,095
Making me look bad.

1181
01:24:33,096 --> 01:24:35,055
We liked him immediately.

1182
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:37,182
So I'm backing out the door, right?

1183
01:24:37,267 --> 01:24:38,976
And I got the TV like this.

1184
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:42,896
It was a big old thing. I couldn't see shit.
Suddenly, I hears this voice.

1185
01:24:42,981 --> 01:24:45,024
"Freeze, kid! Hands in the air."

1186
01:24:45,108 --> 01:24:46,775
Well, I just stand there,

1187
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:49,653
holding onto that TV.
So, finally, the voice says,

1188
01:24:49,738 --> 01:24:51,697
"Do you hear what I said, boy?"

1189
01:24:51,781 --> 01:24:54,158
I say, "Yes, sir, I sure did.

1190
01:24:54,242 --> 01:24:57,870
But if I drop this fucking thing,
you got me on destruction of property, too."

1191
01:25:01,959 --> 01:25:04,669
Hey, you've done a stretch in Cashman, right?

1192
01:25:04,754 --> 01:25:08,590
Yeah. Yeah, that was an easy piece of time,
let me tell you.

1193
01:25:08,674 --> 01:25:11,301
Weekend furloughs, work programs.

1194
01:25:11,385 --> 01:25:12,802
Not like here.

1195
01:25:12,887 --> 01:25:15,221
Sounds like you done time
all over New England.

1196
01:25:15,306 --> 01:25:20,393
Yeah, I've been in and out since I was 13. You
name the place, chances are I've been there.

1197
01:25:20,478 --> 01:25:24,481
Perhaps it's time you tried a new profession?

1198
01:25:24,565 --> 01:25:29,652
What I mean is, you don't seem to be a good
thief. Maybe you should try something else.

1199
01:25:29,737 --> 01:25:33,573
Yeah, well, what the hell
do you know about it, Capone?

1200
01:25:33,657 --> 01:25:35,408
What are you in for?

1201
01:25:35,493 --> 01:25:37,118
Me?

1202
01:25:38,621 --> 01:25:40,705
The lawyer fucked me.

1203
01:25:44,418 --> 01:25:47,837
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

1204
01:25:55,304 --> 01:25:59,475
As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.

1205
01:26:00,519 --> 01:26:03,083
Maybe it was the thought of them on the streets

1206
01:26:03,084 --> 01:26:05,648
or his child growing up not knowing her daddy.

1207
01:26:05,732 --> 01:26:09,568
Whatever it was,
something lit a fire under that boy's ass.

1208
01:26:13,532 --> 01:26:16,784
I was thinking of maybe
trying for my high school equivalency.

1209
01:26:16,868 --> 01:26:19,453
I hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.

1210
01:26:20,664 --> 01:26:22,873
I don't waste time on losers, Tommy.

1211
01:26:24,459 --> 01:26:26,544
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1212
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:30,464
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

1213
01:26:32,134 --> 01:26:34,176
You really mean that?

1214
01:26:34,261 --> 01:26:35,928
Yes, sir, I do.

1215
01:26:36,012 --> 01:26:38,139
Good. Because if we do this,

1216
01:26:38,223 --> 01:26:40,975
we do it all the way, 100%, nothing half-assed.

1217
01:26:42,102 --> 01:26:44,186
The thing is, see...

1218
01:26:45,355 --> 01:26:47,189
..I don't read so good.

1219
01:26:48,316 --> 01:26:49,525
Well.

1220
01:26:51,278 --> 01:26:53,320
You don't read...

1221
01:26:53,405 --> 01:26:55,490
so well.

1222
01:26:56,951 --> 01:26:58,618
We'll get to that.

1223
01:26:59,704 --> 01:27:01,454
- R.
- R...

1224
01:27:01,539 --> 01:27:02,914
- S.
- S...

1225
01:27:02,999 --> 01:27:05,167
So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1226
01:27:05,251 --> 01:27:07,669
He started walking him through his ABCs.

1227
01:27:09,338 --> 01:27:11,923
Tommy took to it pretty well, too.

1228
01:27:12,008 --> 01:27:14,968
The boy found brains he never knew he had.

1229
01:27:17,305 --> 01:27:21,099
Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.

1230
01:27:21,184 --> 01:27:23,143
He really liked the kid.

1231
01:27:23,227 --> 01:27:26,396
It gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.

1232
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,482
But that wasn't the only reason.

1233
01:27:29,567 --> 01:27:32,027
Prison time is slow time.

1234
01:27:33,070 --> 01:27:35,322
So you do what you can to keep going.

1235
01:27:35,406 --> 01:27:37,657
Some fellas collect stamps.

1236
01:27:37,658 --> 01:27:40,285
Others build matchstick houses.

1237
01:27:41,329 --> 01:27:43,705
Andy built a library.

1238
01:27:44,749 --> 01:27:46,791
Now he needed a new project.

1239
01:27:46,876 --> 01:27:48,919
Tommy was it.

1240
01:27:49,003 --> 01:27:53,216
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

1241
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:56,928
The same reason
he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1242
01:27:58,305 --> 01:27:59,805
In prison,

1243
01:27:59,890 --> 01:28:03,017
a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1244
01:28:04,478 --> 01:28:08,940
By 1966, right about the time
Tommy was getting ready to take his exams,

1245
01:28:08,941 --> 01:28:10,983
it was lovely Raquel.

1246
01:28:28,252 --> 01:28:29,293
Time.

1247
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:36,592
Well?

1248
01:28:37,678 --> 01:28:39,220
Well, it's for shit.

1249
01:28:39,304 --> 01:28:41,806
I wasted a whole fucking year of my time

1250
01:28:41,890 --> 01:28:45,059
- with this bullshit.
- It's probably not as bad as you think.

1251
01:28:45,143 --> 01:28:48,854
It's worse. I didn't get one thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1252
01:28:48,939 --> 01:28:51,441
Let's see how the score comes out.

1253
01:28:51,526 --> 01:28:54,152
Well, I'll tell you how the goddamn score
comes out.

1254
01:28:55,947 --> 01:28:57,864
Two points right there.

1255
01:28:57,949 --> 01:28:59,741
There's your goddamn score!

1256
01:28:59,826 --> 01:29:03,662
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5x5 is 25.

1257
01:29:04,747 --> 01:29:06,290
Fuck this place!

1258
01:29:06,291 --> 01:29:07,582
Fuck it!

1259
01:29:26,394 --> 01:29:29,146
I feel bad. I let him down.

1260
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:31,315
Ah, that's crap, kid.

1261
01:29:31,316 --> 01:29:32,858
He's proud of you.

1262
01:29:32,942 --> 01:29:36,069
We've been friends a long time
so I know him as good as anybody.

1263
01:29:36,154 --> 01:29:39,031
- A smart fellow, ain't he?
- As smart as they come.

1264
01:29:39,115 --> 01:29:41,158
He used to be a banker on the outside.

1265
01:29:41,242 --> 01:29:43,285
What's he in here for, anyway?

1266
01:29:43,369 --> 01:29:44,870
Murder.

1267
01:29:45,997 --> 01:29:47,748
The hell you say!

1268
01:29:49,877 --> 01:29:52,170
You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.

1269
01:29:53,213 --> 01:29:55,673
He caught his wife in bed with some golf pro.

1270
01:29:55,758 --> 01:29:57,842
He greased them both.

1271
01:30:05,726 --> 01:30:07,602
What?

1272
01:30:07,686 --> 01:30:10,063
About four years ago,

1273
01:30:10,147 --> 01:30:13,232
I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.

1274
01:30:14,485 --> 01:30:17,570
I stole a car. It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1275
01:30:18,864 --> 01:30:20,907
About six months left to go,

1276
01:30:20,991 --> 01:30:23,034
I get a new cellmate in.

1277
01:30:23,118 --> 01:30:24,994
Elmo Blatch.

1278
01:30:26,038 --> 01:30:27,622
Big, twitchy fucker.

1279
01:30:27,623 --> 01:30:29,916
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.

1280
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,043
You know what I'm saying?

1281
01:30:32,127 --> 01:30:34,170
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1282
01:30:34,254 --> 01:30:37,465
He said he'd pulled hundreds of jobs.

1283
01:30:37,549 --> 01:30:39,425
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.

1284
01:30:39,510 --> 01:30:42,512
You'd cut a loud fart,
he'd jump three feet in the air.

1285
01:30:43,639 --> 01:30:45,681
Talked all the time, too.

1286
01:30:45,766 --> 01:30:48,102
That's the other thing. He never shut up.

1287
01:30:48,186 --> 01:30:50,229
Places he'd been in,

1288
01:30:50,313 --> 01:30:52,981
jobs he'd pulled, women he'd fucked.

1289
01:30:53,066 --> 01:30:55,484
Even people he'd killed.

1290
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:59,696
People who gave him shit.

1291
01:31:00,740 --> 01:31:02,783
That's how he put it.

1292
01:31:02,867 --> 01:31:04,410
So...

1293
01:31:04,494 --> 01:31:06,578
one night, like a joke,

1294
01:31:07,622 --> 01:31:10,916
I say to him, I say,
"Yeah, Elmo, who did you kill?"

1295
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,793
So he says...

1296
01:31:12,877 --> 01:31:16,505
I got me this job one time
bussing tables at a country club.

1297
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:21,218
So I could case
all these big rich pricks that come in.

1298
01:31:23,638 --> 01:31:25,639
So I pick out this guy,

1299
01:31:26,683 --> 01:31:29,268
go in one night and do his place.

1300
01:31:31,438 --> 01:31:33,439
He wakes up.

1301
01:31:33,523 --> 01:31:35,566
He gives me shit.

1302
01:31:36,609 --> 01:31:38,694
So I killed him.

1303
01:31:39,737 --> 01:31:41,822
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1304
01:31:44,117 --> 01:31:46,035
That's the best part.

1305
01:31:47,079 --> 01:31:50,290
She's fucking this prick, see, this golf pro.

1306
01:31:50,374 --> 01:31:52,459
But she's married to some other guy.

1307
01:31:53,502 --> 01:31:55,587
Some hotshot banker.

1308
01:31:57,381 --> 01:31:59,466
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1309
01:32:10,603 --> 01:32:14,439
I have to say
that's the most amazing story I ever heard.

1310
01:32:16,066 --> 01:32:18,943
What amazes me most is
you were taken in by it.

1311
01:32:19,028 --> 01:32:20,653
Sir?

1312
01:32:20,738 --> 01:32:22,405
Well...

1313
01:32:22,490 --> 01:32:25,867
it's obvious this fella Williams
is impressed with you.

1314
01:32:25,951 --> 01:32:28,036
He hears your tale of woe

1315
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:31,039
and quite naturally wants to cheer you up.

1316
01:32:31,123 --> 01:32:33,166
He's young, not terribly bright.

1317
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:37,128
Not surprising he wouldn't know
what a state he'd put you in.

1318
01:32:37,213 --> 01:32:39,339
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1319
01:32:39,423 --> 01:32:43,469
Well, let's say, for the moment,
this Blatch does exist.

1320
01:32:43,553 --> 01:32:46,680
You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry,

1321
01:32:46,765 --> 01:32:48,974
"Yes, I did it! I confess!

1322
01:32:49,059 --> 01:32:51,268
And by the way,
add a life term to my sentence"?

1323
01:32:51,353 --> 01:32:54,522
That doesn't matter.
With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.

1324
01:32:54,606 --> 01:32:57,816
That's assuming Blatch is even still there.

1325
01:32:57,901 --> 01:32:59,944
The chances are he'd be released by now.

1326
01:33:00,028 --> 01:33:02,613
They'd have his last address,
names of relatives.

1327
01:33:02,697 --> 01:33:04,865
There's a chance, isn't there?

1328
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:08,786
How can you be so obtuse?

1329
01:33:08,870 --> 01:33:10,371
What?

1330
01:33:11,873 --> 01:33:13,707
What did you call me?

1331
01:33:13,792 --> 01:33:15,626
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1332
01:33:15,710 --> 01:33:17,503
Son, you're forgetting yourself.

1333
01:33:17,587 --> 01:33:20,422
The country club will have his old timecards,

1334
01:33:20,507 --> 01:33:22,633
records, W-2s,

1335
01:33:22,717 --> 01:33:26,720
- with his name on them. - If you
indulge this fantasy, that's your business.

1336
01:33:26,805 --> 01:33:30,766
- Don't make it mine. This meeting is over.
- Sir, if I were to ever get out,

1337
01:33:30,850 --> 01:33:35,854
I would never mention what goes on in here. I'd
be as indictable as you for laundering money.

1338
01:33:37,649 --> 01:33:40,651
Don't ever mention money to me again,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1339
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:42,612
Not in this office.

1340
01:33:42,613 --> 01:33:44,739
Not anywhere! Get in here now.

1341
01:33:44,824 --> 01:33:48,076
I'm just trying to set your mind at ease,
that's all. Sir, I...

1342
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,536
Solitary. A month.

1343
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:51,788
- Yes, sir.
- What's the matter with you?

1344
01:33:51,872 --> 01:33:55,125
- Get him out of here.
- This is my chance to get out! Don't you see?

1345
01:33:55,126 --> 01:33:57,127
It's my life! Don't you understand?

1346
01:33:57,211 --> 01:33:59,671
- Get him out! Get him out!
- This is my life!

1347
01:33:59,755 --> 01:34:01,006
No!

1348
01:34:01,090 --> 01:34:02,924
A month in the hole.

1349
01:34:03,009 --> 01:34:05,594
It's the longest damn stretch I ever heard of.

1350
01:34:05,678 --> 01:34:07,470
It's all my fault.

1351
01:34:07,555 --> 01:34:08,972
Oh, bullshit.

1352
01:34:09,056 --> 01:34:12,350
You didn't pull the trigger
and you certainly didn't convict him.

1353
01:34:12,435 --> 01:34:14,811
Red, are you saying that Andy is innocent?

1354
01:34:14,895 --> 01:34:17,063
I mean, for real innocent?

1355
01:34:17,148 --> 01:34:19,190
It looks that way.

1356
01:34:19,275 --> 01:34:21,318
Sweet Jesus.

1357
01:34:21,402 --> 01:34:23,445
How long's he been here now?

1358
01:34:23,529 --> 01:34:25,572
1947. What is that?

1359
01:34:25,656 --> 01:34:27,198
- 19 years.
19 years...

1360
01:34:27,283 --> 01:34:29,909
Williams, Thomas.
- Yeah, over here.

1361
01:34:32,288 --> 01:34:34,539
- Paxon, Edward.
- Yeah.

1362
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:38,668
What you got? Board of Education.

1363
01:34:38,753 --> 01:34:41,422
- The son of a bitch mailed it.
- Looks like he did.

1364
01:34:41,506 --> 01:34:44,550
Are you gonna open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1365
01:34:44,635 --> 01:34:46,719
The thumb up my butt sounds better.

1366
01:34:47,763 --> 01:34:50,514
Hey, Skeet, come on,
give me that, you shithead.

1367
01:34:51,558 --> 01:34:53,768
- Floyd, come on.
- Over here, over here!

1368
01:34:54,811 --> 01:34:56,896
Hey, Red!

1369
01:34:58,023 --> 01:35:00,441
Come on, will you throw that away, please?

1370
01:35:06,031 --> 01:35:08,115
Well, shit.

1371
01:35:20,337 --> 01:35:23,047
The kid passed. C+ average.

1372
01:35:23,131 --> 01:35:25,216
Thought you'd like to know.

1373
01:35:41,776 --> 01:35:43,860
The Warden wants to talk.

1374
01:35:57,250 --> 01:35:58,375
Out here?

1375
01:35:58,459 --> 01:36:00,544
That's what the man said.

1376
01:36:16,853 --> 01:36:18,645
Warden?

1377
01:36:18,730 --> 01:36:20,814
Tommy.

1378
01:36:26,279 --> 01:36:27,738
Tommy...

1379
01:36:27,822 --> 01:36:31,908
I'm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

1380
01:36:33,327 --> 01:36:35,413
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1381
01:36:53,891 --> 01:36:55,975
We got a situation here.

1382
01:36:57,019 --> 01:36:59,061
I think you can appreciate that.

1383
01:36:59,146 --> 01:37:00,605
Yes, sir.

1384
01:37:00,689 --> 01:37:02,190
I sure can.

1385
01:37:02,274 --> 01:37:06,319
I tell you, son, this thing really came along
and knocked my wind out.

1386
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:10,573
It's got me up nights, that's the truth.

1387
01:37:12,785 --> 01:37:14,869
The right thing to do.

1388
01:37:16,205 --> 01:37:19,207
Sometimes it's hard to know what that is.

1389
01:37:20,918 --> 01:37:22,960
You understand?

1390
01:37:24,338 --> 01:37:26,422
I need your help, son.

1391
01:37:27,841 --> 01:37:29,926
If I'm going to move on this,

1392
01:37:29,927 --> 01:37:32,678
there can't be the least little shred of doubt.

1393
01:37:34,224 --> 01:37:37,643
I have to know
if what you told Dufresne was the truth.

1394
01:37:37,727 --> 01:37:39,311
Yes, sir.

1395
01:37:39,312 --> 01:37:40,938
Absolutely.

1396
01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:44,107
Would you be willing
to swear before a judge and jury,

1397
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:46,610
having placed your hand on the Good Book

1398
01:37:46,611 --> 01:37:49,321
and taken an oath before Almighty God himself?

1399
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:51,532
Just give me that chance.

1400
01:37:55,453 --> 01:37:57,120
That's what I thought.

1401
01:38:44,211 --> 01:38:46,296
I'm sure by now you've heard...

1402
01:38:47,548 --> 01:38:48,923
A terrible thing.

1403
01:38:50,384 --> 01:38:53,970
A man that young, less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1404
01:38:55,055 --> 01:38:57,682
It broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.

1405
01:38:58,726 --> 01:39:00,810
Truly, it did.

1406
01:39:02,855 --> 01:39:04,939
We just have to put it behind us.

1407
01:39:07,109 --> 01:39:08,526
Move on.

1408
01:39:09,987 --> 01:39:11,863
I'm done.

1409
01:39:12,907 --> 01:39:14,991
Everything stops.

1410
01:39:16,035 --> 01:39:18,870
Get someone else to run your scams.

1411
01:39:20,205 --> 01:39:22,290
Nothing stops.

1412
01:39:23,334 --> 01:39:25,418
Nothing.

1413
01:39:27,171 --> 01:39:29,256
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1414
01:39:31,134 --> 01:39:33,719
No more protection from the guards.

1415
01:39:33,803 --> 01:39:36,138
I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton

1416
01:39:36,222 --> 01:39:38,390
and cast you down with the Sodomites.

1417
01:39:40,143 --> 01:39:42,645
You'll think you've been fucked by a train.

1418
01:39:43,939 --> 01:39:45,981
And the library?

1419
01:39:46,066 --> 01:39:47,191
Gone.

1420
01:39:47,275 --> 01:39:49,652
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1421
01:39:50,695 --> 01:39:53,489
We'll have us a little
book barbecue in the yard.

1422
01:39:53,573 --> 01:39:55,616
They'll see the flames for miles.

1423
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:58,202
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1424
01:39:59,788 --> 01:40:01,705
You understand me?

1425
01:40:01,790 --> 01:40:03,874
Catching my drift?

1426
01:40:06,962 --> 01:40:09,046
Or am I being obtuse?

1427
01:40:20,183 --> 01:40:22,309
Give him another month to think about it.

1428
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:12,944
My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.

1429
01:41:13,029 --> 01:41:15,113
Like a closed book.

1430
01:41:16,323 --> 01:41:19,075
Complained about it all the time.

1431
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:21,244
She was beautiful.

1432
01:41:23,456 --> 01:41:25,541
God, I loved her.

1433
01:41:28,545 --> 01:41:30,880
I just didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1434
01:41:33,383 --> 01:41:35,468
I killed her, Red.

1435
01:41:36,928 --> 01:41:39,013
I didn't pull the trigger.

1436
01:41:40,432 --> 01:41:42,516
But I drove her away.

1437
01:41:43,727 --> 01:41:46,270
That's why she died, because of me.

1438
01:41:46,354 --> 01:41:48,439
The way I am.

1439
01:41:56,782 --> 01:41:58,866
That don't make you a murderer.

1440
01:42:02,079 --> 01:42:04,163
A bad husband, maybe.

1441
01:42:07,542 --> 01:42:10,920
Feel bad about it if you want to,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1442
01:42:11,004 --> 01:42:12,421
No, I didn't.

1443
01:42:12,506 --> 01:42:14,548
Somebody else did.

1444
01:42:15,842 --> 01:42:17,927
And I wound up in here.

1445
01:42:20,305 --> 01:42:22,389
Bad luck, I guess.

1446
01:42:25,311 --> 01:42:27,020
Yeah.

1447
01:42:27,105 --> 01:42:29,397
It floats around.

1448
01:42:29,482 --> 01:42:31,942
It's got to land on somebody.

1449
01:42:32,026 --> 01:42:34,277
It was my turn, that's all.

1450
01:42:35,363 --> 01:42:37,823
I was in the path of the tornado.

1451
01:42:44,413 --> 01:42:48,166
I just didn't expect
the storm would last as long as it has.

1452
01:42:52,255 --> 01:42:54,172
Do you think you'll ever get out of here?

1453
01:42:55,424 --> 01:42:57,092
Me?

1454
01:42:59,387 --> 01:43:00,846
Yeah.

1455
01:43:01,889 --> 01:43:03,849
One day, when I've got a long, white beard

1456
01:43:03,933 --> 01:43:07,435
and two or three marbles rolling
around upstairs, they'll let me out.

1457
01:43:09,355 --> 01:43:11,439
I tell you where I'd go.

1458
01:43:12,650 --> 01:43:14,276
Zihuatanejo.

1459
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:16,278
Zi...what?

1460
01:43:16,362 --> 01:43:18,405
Zihuatanejo.

1461
01:43:18,489 --> 01:43:20,574
It's in Mexico.

1462
01:43:22,369 --> 01:43:24,579
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1463
01:43:25,831 --> 01:43:28,207
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1464
01:43:28,292 --> 01:43:29,750
No.

1465
01:43:29,835 --> 01:43:31,919
They say it has no memory.

1466
01:43:34,381 --> 01:43:36,924
That's where I want to live the rest of my life.

1467
01:43:38,510 --> 01:43:40,595
A warm place with no memory.

1468
01:43:43,891 --> 01:43:46,184
Open up a little hotel,

1469
01:43:48,020 --> 01:43:49,896
right on the beach.

1470
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:52,023
Buy some worthless old boat,

1471
01:43:52,107 --> 01:43:54,192
fix it up new.

1472
01:43:57,154 --> 01:43:58,362
Take my guests out.

1473
01:43:58,447 --> 01:44:00,531
Charter fishing.

1474
01:44:04,453 --> 01:44:07,079
Zihuatanejo, huh?

1475
01:44:09,708 --> 01:44:13,586
In a place like that, I could use a man
who knows how to get things.

1476
01:44:20,011 --> 01:44:22,721
I don't think I could make
it on the outside, Andy.

1477
01:44:29,479 --> 01:44:31,563
I've been in here most of my life.

1478
01:44:33,066 --> 01:44:34,858
I'm an institutional man now.

1479
01:44:34,943 --> 01:44:37,027
Just like Brooks was.

1480
01:44:38,446 --> 01:44:40,697
Well, you underestimate yourself.

1481
01:44:40,782 --> 01:44:42,866
I don't think so.

1482
01:44:45,495 --> 01:44:49,706
I mean...in here, I'm the guy
who can get things for you, sure.

1483
01:44:49,791 --> 01:44:53,710
But outside, all you need is the Yellow Pages.

1484
01:44:53,795 --> 01:44:56,213
Hell, I wouldn't even know where to begin.

1485
01:44:58,299 --> 01:45:00,634
The Pacific Ocean?

1486
01:45:00,718 --> 01:45:02,761
Shit.

1487
01:45:02,845 --> 01:45:06,014
- About scare me to death, something that big.
- Not me.

1488
01:45:06,099 --> 01:45:09,559
I didn't shoot my wife
and I didn't shoot her lover.

1489
01:45:11,479 --> 01:45:15,107
Whatever mistakes I've made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1490
01:45:15,191 --> 01:45:17,359
That hotel, that boat.

1491
01:45:18,946 --> 01:45:21,114
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1492
01:45:25,744 --> 01:45:28,621
I don't think you ought to be
doing this to yourself, Andy.

1493
01:45:28,706 --> 01:45:30,748
These are just shitty pipe dreams.

1494
01:45:30,833 --> 01:45:33,793
I mean, Mexico is way the hell down there
and you're in here.

1495
01:45:33,877 --> 01:45:35,920
And that's the way it is.

1496
01:45:36,005 --> 01:45:38,631
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

1497
01:45:40,384 --> 01:45:42,468
It's down there and I'm in here.

1498
01:45:45,180 --> 01:45:47,974
I guess it comes down
to a simple choice, really.

1499
01:45:50,811 --> 01:45:52,854
Get busy living

1500
01:45:52,938 --> 01:45:55,857
or get busy dying.

1501
01:45:59,653 --> 01:46:01,738
Andy.

1502
01:46:04,199 --> 01:46:06,284
Red.

1503
01:46:07,328 --> 01:46:09,746
If you ever get out of here, do me a favor.

1504
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:11,664
Sure, Andy.

1505
01:46:11,749 --> 01:46:13,082
Anything.

1506
01:46:14,168 --> 01:46:17,629
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1507
01:46:19,632 --> 01:46:23,427
- Well, just... There's a lot of
hayfields up there. - One in particular.

1508
01:46:23,511 --> 01:46:25,554
It's got a long rock wall

1509
01:46:25,638 --> 01:46:27,556
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1510
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:30,351
It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.

1511
01:46:31,728 --> 01:46:34,438
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1512
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:39,443
We went there for a picnic
and made love under that oak.

1513
01:46:40,945 --> 01:46:43,030
I asked and she said yes.

1514
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:49,203
Promise me, Red,

1515
01:46:49,287 --> 01:46:51,288
if you ever get out,

1516
01:46:51,373 --> 01:46:53,415
find that spot.

1517
01:46:54,459 --> 01:46:57,190
At the base of that
wall, you'll find a rock that

1518
01:46:57,191 --> 01:46:59,922
has no earthly business in a Maine hayfield.

1519
01:47:00,006 --> 01:47:02,508
A piece of black, volcanic glass.

1520
01:47:05,678 --> 01:47:08,472
There's something buried under it
I want you to have.

1521
01:47:08,556 --> 01:47:10,557
What, Andy?

1522
01:47:10,642 --> 01:47:12,726
What's buried under there?

1523
01:47:14,522 --> 01:47:17,899
You'll have to pry it up to see.

1524
01:47:23,239 --> 01:47:25,323
No, I'm telling you, the guy is...

1525
01:47:26,367 --> 01:47:28,451
He's talking funnier.

1526
01:47:28,536 --> 01:47:31,913
- I'm really worried about him.
- We ought to keep an eye on him.

1527
01:47:31,997 --> 01:47:36,042
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's got that cell all to himself.

1528
01:47:37,128 --> 01:47:38,586
Oh, Lord.

1529
01:47:38,671 --> 01:47:40,713
What?

1530
01:47:42,383 --> 01:47:44,717
Andy come down to the loading dock today.

1531
01:47:44,802 --> 01:47:48,304
- He asked me for a length of rope.
- Rope?

1532
01:47:48,389 --> 01:47:50,223
Six feet long.

1533
01:47:50,307 --> 01:47:51,766
And you gave it to him?

1534
01:47:51,851 --> 01:47:54,519
Sure I did. Why wouldn't I?

1535
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:56,229
Jesus, Heywood.

1536
01:47:56,313 --> 01:47:58,565
Hey, how the hell was I supposed to know?

1537
01:47:58,649 --> 01:48:00,567
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1538
01:48:00,651 --> 01:48:01,693
No.

1539
01:48:02,736 --> 01:48:04,946
Andy would never do that.

1540
01:48:04,947 --> 01:48:07,031
Never.

1541
01:48:08,075 --> 01:48:10,160
I don't know.

1542
01:48:12,205 --> 01:48:14,290
Every man has his breaking point.

1543
01:48:16,918 --> 01:48:18,169
Lickety-split.

1544
01:48:18,253 --> 01:48:21,130
- I want to get home.
- Just about finished, sir.

1545
01:48:37,230 --> 01:48:39,315
Three deposits tonight.

1546
01:48:47,699 --> 01:48:49,783
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1547
01:48:49,784 --> 01:48:53,245
And shine my shoes.
I want 'em looking like mirrors.

1548
01:48:53,330 --> 01:48:54,705
Yes, sir.

1549
01:49:00,003 --> 01:49:01,670
It's good having you back, Andy.

1550
01:49:01,755 --> 01:49:04,507
The place wasn't the same without you.

1551
01:49:51,556 --> 01:49:54,307
Lights out!

1552
01:50:25,048 --> 01:50:27,341
I've had some long nights in stir.

1553
01:50:28,385 --> 01:50:31,095
Alone in the dark with
nothing but your thoughts,

1554
01:50:31,179 --> 01:50:33,014
time can draw out like a blade.

1555
01:50:39,396 --> 01:50:41,731
That was the longest night of my life.

1556
01:50:57,873 --> 01:50:59,498
Give me a count.

1557
01:51:03,837 --> 01:51:05,880
Tier 3 South. Clear.

1558
01:51:05,964 --> 01:51:07,299
Tier 4 North. Clear.

1559
01:51:07,383 --> 01:51:10,969
- Tier 3 North. Clear.
- Man missing on Tier 2.

1560
01:51:11,054 --> 01:51:14,139
- Cell 245.
- Dufresne.

1561
01:51:14,223 --> 01:51:17,142
Get your ass out here, boy.
You're holding up the show.

1562
01:51:19,646 --> 01:51:23,690
Don't make me come down there.
I'll thump your skull for you.

1563
01:51:31,282 --> 01:51:34,660
Damn it, Dufresne, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

1564
01:51:34,744 --> 01:51:37,829
You'd better be sick or dead in there,
I shit you not!

1565
01:51:37,914 --> 01:51:39,748
You hear me?

1566
01:51:46,255 --> 01:51:48,340
Oh, my holy God.

1567
01:52:05,192 --> 01:52:07,902
I want every man on this cell block questioned.

1568
01:52:07,903 --> 01:52:10,113
- Start with that friend of his.
- Who?

1569
01:52:10,197 --> 01:52:11,406
Him!

1570
01:52:13,325 --> 01:52:15,410
Open 237.

1571
01:52:18,414 --> 01:52:20,540
What do you mean, he just wasn't here?

1572
01:52:20,624 --> 01:52:22,166
Don't say that to me, Haig.

1573
01:52:22,251 --> 01:52:24,502
Don't say that to me again.

1574
01:52:24,586 --> 01:52:25,670
But, sir, he wasn't.

1575
01:52:25,754 --> 01:52:27,922
I can see that, Haig!

1576
01:52:28,006 --> 01:52:29,799
You think I'm blind?

1577
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:32,927
Is that what you're saying? Am I blind, Haig?

1578
01:52:33,011 --> 01:52:34,011
No, sir.

1579
01:52:34,096 --> 01:52:36,139
What about you?

1580
01:52:36,223 --> 01:52:38,057
Are you blind?

1581
01:52:38,142 --> 01:52:40,685
- Tell me what this is.
- Last night's count.

1582
01:52:40,769 --> 01:52:44,063
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. See? Right there.

1583
01:52:44,148 --> 01:52:46,023
Dufresne.

1584
01:52:47,276 --> 01:52:48,943
He was in his cell at lights out.

1585
01:52:49,027 --> 01:52:52,238
It stands to reason
he'd still be here in the morning.

1586
01:52:53,323 --> 01:52:55,199
I want him found.

1587
01:52:55,284 --> 01:52:57,869
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast.

1588
01:52:57,953 --> 01:52:58,995
Now!

1589
01:52:58,996 --> 01:53:00,496
Yes, sir!

1590
01:53:01,623 --> 01:53:04,209
Let's go, let's go!
Move your butts! Move it!

1591
01:53:07,046 --> 01:53:08,088
Stand.

1592
01:53:09,215 --> 01:53:10,466
Well?

1593
01:53:13,845 --> 01:53:14,970
Well, what?

1594
01:53:15,054 --> 01:53:18,515
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1595
01:53:19,559 --> 01:53:21,185
He must have said something.

1596
01:53:21,269 --> 01:53:23,312
No, sir, Warden.

1597
01:53:23,396 --> 01:53:24,855
Not a word.

1598
01:53:26,858 --> 01:53:28,859
Lord, it's a miracle!

1599
01:53:29,903 --> 01:53:32,362
A man up and vanished like a fart in the wind.

1600
01:53:32,447 --> 01:53:34,198
Nothing left but...

1601
01:53:34,282 --> 01:53:37,201
some damn rocks on a windowsill.

1602
01:53:37,285 --> 01:53:39,036
And that cupcake on the wall.

1603
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:40,746
Let's ask her.

1604
01:53:40,830 --> 01:53:44,792
Maybe she knows. What say there,
Fuzzy Britches? Feel like talking?

1605
01:53:45,877 --> 01:53:46,960
Ah...

1606
01:53:46,961 --> 01:53:48,420
I guess not.

1607
01:53:48,505 --> 01:53:51,381
Why should she be any different?

1608
01:53:51,466 --> 01:53:53,926
This is a conspiracy.

1609
01:53:54,010 --> 01:53:56,220
That's what this is.

1610
01:53:56,304 --> 01:53:57,846
One big...

1611
01:53:57,931 --> 01:54:00,683
damn conspiracy!

1612
01:54:00,768 --> 01:54:03,436
And everyone's in on it!

1613
01:54:03,521 --> 01:54:04,813
Including her!

1614
01:54:39,473 --> 01:54:41,349
In 1966,

1615
01:54:41,433 --> 01:54:44,102
Andy Dufresne escaped

1616
01:54:44,186 --> 01:54:46,271
from Shawshank Prison.

1617
01:54:47,940 --> 01:54:50,692
All they found of him
was a muddy set of prison clothes,

1618
01:54:50,776 --> 01:54:52,819
a bar of soap

1619
01:54:52,903 --> 01:54:57,282
and an old rock hammer
damn near worn down to the nub.

1620
01:55:01,663 --> 01:55:06,500
I remember thinking it would take a man
600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.

1621
01:55:06,585 --> 01:55:09,295
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1622
01:55:27,856 --> 01:55:29,940
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1623
01:55:30,984 --> 01:55:34,486
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.

1624
01:55:34,571 --> 01:55:36,864
An Ice Age here,

1625
01:55:36,948 --> 01:55:39,533
a million years of mountain-building there.

1626
01:55:40,577 --> 01:55:42,995
Geology is the study of pressure and time.

1627
01:55:44,205 --> 01:55:46,248
That's all it takes, really.

1628
01:55:46,333 --> 01:55:48,375
Pressure...

1629
01:55:48,460 --> 01:55:50,336
and time.

1630
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:53,756
That and a big goddamn poster.

1631
01:55:56,969 --> 01:55:58,345
Like I said,

1632
01:55:58,346 --> 01:56:02,140
in prison, a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1633
01:56:04,936 --> 01:56:10,106
It turns out Andy's favorite hobby
was toting his wall out into the exercise yard.

1634
01:56:10,191 --> 01:56:12,275
A handful at a time.

1635
01:56:14,111 --> 01:56:16,279
I guess after Tommy was killed,

1636
01:56:16,364 --> 01:56:19,199
Andy decided he'd been here
just about long enough.

1637
01:56:19,283 --> 01:56:21,493
Lickety-split. I want to get home.

1638
01:56:22,787 --> 01:56:24,871
I'm just about finished, sir.

1639
01:56:46,268 --> 01:56:48,353
Three deposits tonight.

1640
01:56:55,529 --> 01:56:57,571
Andy did like he was told.

1641
01:56:58,615 --> 01:57:02,118
Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine.

1642
01:57:05,706 --> 01:57:07,748
The guard simply didn't notice.

1643
01:57:07,833 --> 01:57:09,875
Neither did I.

1644
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:14,296
I mean, seriously, how often
do you really look at a man's shoes?

1645
01:59:18,340 --> 01:59:24,512
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards
of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.

1646
01:59:25,848 --> 01:59:27,849
Or maybe I just don't want to.

1647
01:59:32,563 --> 01:59:34,772
500 yards.

1648
01:59:35,816 --> 01:59:38,317
That's the length of five football fields.

1649
01:59:39,361 --> 01:59:41,612
Just shy of half a mile.

1650
02:00:36,836 --> 02:00:41,381
The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her little secret,

1651
02:00:41,466 --> 02:00:44,885
a man nobody ever laid eyes on before

1652
02:00:44,969 --> 02:00:47,388
strode into the Maine National Bank.

1653
02:00:47,473 --> 02:00:49,515
Until that moment,

1654
02:00:49,600 --> 02:00:51,476
he didn't exist,

1655
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:52,894
except on paper.

1656
02:00:52,978 --> 02:00:54,020
May I help you?

1657
02:00:54,104 --> 02:00:56,147
He had all the proper ID,

1658
02:00:56,232 --> 02:00:59,859
driver's license, birth certificate,
social security card.

1659
02:00:59,944 --> 02:01:03,238
And the signature was a spot-on match.

1660
02:01:03,322 --> 02:01:06,366
I must say, I'm sorry
to be losing your business.

1661
02:01:06,450 --> 02:01:08,451
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1662
02:01:08,535 --> 02:01:10,328
Thank you.

1663
02:01:10,412 --> 02:01:12,205
I'm sure I will.

1664
02:01:12,289 --> 02:01:14,415
Here's your cashier's check, sir.

1665
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:16,542
Will there be anything else?

1666
02:01:16,627 --> 02:01:17,627
Please...

1667
02:01:17,711 --> 02:01:20,797
Would you add this to your outgoing mail?

1668
02:01:20,881 --> 02:01:23,091
I'd be happy to.

1669
02:01:23,175 --> 02:01:25,510
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

1670
02:01:25,594 --> 02:01:30,390
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the Portland area that morning.

1671
02:01:31,558 --> 02:01:38,022
All told, he blew town with better than $370,000
of Warden Norton's money.

1672
02:01:38,107 --> 02:01:40,566
Severance pay for 19 years.

1673
02:01:48,702 --> 02:01:50,995
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1674
02:02:43,716 --> 02:02:46,718
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

1675
02:02:46,802 --> 02:02:49,116
If you give up the right
to remain silent, anything

1676
02:02:49,117 --> 02:02:51,431
you say will be held against you in court.

1677
02:02:51,515 --> 02:02:53,391
I wasn't there to see it.

1678
02:02:53,476 --> 02:02:58,355
But I hear Byron Hadley started sobbing
like a little girl when they took him away.

1679
02:03:03,778 --> 02:03:06,571
Norton had no intention of going that quietly.

1680
02:03:22,546 --> 02:03:24,005
Samuel Norton?

1681
02:03:24,090 --> 02:03:27,342
We have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.

1682
02:03:30,221 --> 02:03:31,346
Norton!

1683
02:03:31,430 --> 02:03:33,098
Open the door.

1684
02:03:33,182 --> 02:03:34,933
I'm not sure which key it is.

1685
02:03:37,812 --> 02:03:39,479
Norton!

1686
02:03:44,945 --> 02:03:47,029
Make it easy on yourself, Norton.

1687
02:03:58,333 --> 02:04:01,919
I like to think
the last thing that went through his head,

1688
02:04:02,003 --> 02:04:03,712
other than that bullet,

1689
02:04:03,797 --> 02:04:07,800
was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1690
02:04:09,469 --> 02:04:10,553
Carter, James...

1691
02:04:10,637 --> 02:04:14,014
Not long after the Warden
deprived us of his company,

1692
02:04:14,099 --> 02:04:16,350
I got a postcard in the mail.

1693
02:04:18,061 --> 02:04:20,479
It was blank but the postmark said...

1694
02:04:20,564 --> 02:04:23,315
Fort Hancock, Texas.

1695
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:25,443
Fort Hancock.

1696
02:04:25,527 --> 02:04:27,570
Right on the border.

1697
02:04:27,654 --> 02:04:29,697
That's where Andy crossed.

1698
02:04:29,781 --> 02:04:33,659
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down,

1699
02:04:34,703 --> 02:04:36,787
it always makes me laugh.

1700
02:04:38,206 --> 02:04:40,250
Andy Dufresne,

1701
02:04:40,334 --> 02:04:42,711
who crawled through a river of shit

1702
02:04:42,795 --> 02:04:44,880
and came out clean on the other side.

1703
02:04:46,090 --> 02:04:48,133
Andy Dufresne,

1704
02:04:48,217 --> 02:04:50,135
headed for the Pacific.

1705
02:04:52,722 --> 02:04:54,764
Hadley's got him by the toes, right?

1706
02:04:54,849 --> 02:04:59,060
And he says, "I believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident."

1707
02:04:59,145 --> 02:05:02,314
Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

1708
02:05:02,398 --> 02:05:04,649
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

1709
02:05:04,734 --> 02:05:07,235
"These friends of mine
could use a couple of beers!"

1710
02:05:07,320 --> 02:05:09,404
- And he got it.
- And he got it!

1711
02:05:10,573 --> 02:05:12,949
Sometimes it makes me sad, though,

1712
02:05:13,034 --> 02:05:15,076
Andy being gone.

1713
02:05:15,161 --> 02:05:19,164
I have to remind myself
that some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1714
02:05:20,249 --> 02:05:22,334
Their feathers are just too bright.

1715
02:05:23,878 --> 02:05:25,921
And when they fly away,

1716
02:05:26,005 --> 02:05:29,925
the part of you that knows
it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1717
02:05:31,677 --> 02:05:33,136
But still...

1718
02:05:33,221 --> 02:05:37,391
the place you live in is that much more drab
and empty that they're gone.

1719
02:05:41,939 --> 02:05:44,190
I guess I just miss my friend.

1720
02:06:08,173 --> 02:06:10,049
Please sit down.

1721
02:06:15,639 --> 02:06:17,765
Ellis Boyd Redding.

1722
02:06:17,849 --> 02:06:21,227
Your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1723
02:06:21,311 --> 02:06:23,688
Do you feel you've been rehabilitated?

1724
02:06:25,816 --> 02:06:27,900
Rehabilitated?

1725
02:06:29,444 --> 02:06:31,529
Well, now, let me see.

1726
02:06:32,573 --> 02:06:34,907
You know, I don't have any idea
what that means.

1727
02:06:36,703 --> 02:06:39,246
Well, it means you're ready to rejoin society...

1728
02:06:39,330 --> 02:06:41,873
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1729
02:06:44,252 --> 02:06:46,336
To me, it's just a made-up word.

1730
02:06:47,380 --> 02:06:49,631
A politician's word so that...

1731
02:06:49,716 --> 02:06:55,220
young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie and have a job.

1732
02:06:57,640 --> 02:06:59,725
What do you really want to know?

1733
02:07:00,893 --> 02:07:02,811
Am I sorry for what I did?

1734
02:07:02,895 --> 02:07:04,605
Well, are you?

1735
02:07:06,232 --> 02:07:08,817
There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.

1736
02:07:10,403 --> 02:07:13,530
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1737
02:07:17,327 --> 02:07:19,411
I look back on the way I was then.

1738
02:07:21,998 --> 02:07:24,041
A young...

1739
02:07:24,125 --> 02:07:27,210
stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.

1740
02:07:31,049 --> 02:07:33,133
I wanna talk to him.

1741
02:07:34,511 --> 02:07:36,679
I wanna try and talk some sense to him,

1742
02:07:37,723 --> 02:07:39,807
tell him the way things are.

1743
02:07:41,977 --> 02:07:44,062
But I can't.

1744
02:07:45,272 --> 02:07:47,357
That kid's long gone.

1745
02:07:48,651 --> 02:07:50,735
This old man is all that's left.

1746
02:07:52,863 --> 02:07:54,364
I gotta live with that.

1747
02:07:55,699 --> 02:07:57,492
Rehabilitated?

1748
02:07:57,576 --> 02:07:59,577
It's just a bullshit word.

1749
02:07:59,662 --> 02:08:05,583
So you go on and stamp your form, sonny,
and stop wasting my time.

1750
02:08:06,669 --> 02:08:08,711
Because to tell you the truth,

1751
02:08:08,796 --> 02:08:11,297
I don't give a shit.

1752
02:09:37,511 --> 02:09:39,596
Here you go, miss.

1753
02:09:41,599 --> 02:09:43,057
Rest room break, boss?

1754
02:09:49,106 --> 02:09:53,401
You don't need to ask me every time you need
to go take a piss. Just go. Understand?

1755
02:09:54,612 --> 02:09:56,279
Yes, sir.

1756
02:10:06,332 --> 02:10:09,375
40 years
I've been asking permission to piss.

1757
02:10:10,377 --> 02:10:12,587
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1758
02:10:16,717 --> 02:10:18,802
There's a harsh truth to face.

1759
02:10:20,763 --> 02:10:23,097
No way I'm gonna make it on the outside.

1760
02:10:31,316 --> 02:10:34,777
All I do any more
is think of ways to break my parole...

1761
02:10:35,821 --> 02:10:37,905
..so maybe they'd send me back.

1762
02:10:43,411 --> 02:10:45,496
A terrible thing to live in fear.

1763
02:10:46,873 --> 02:10:50,251
Brooks Hatlen knew it, knew it all too well.

1764
02:10:52,420 --> 02:10:55,214
All I want is to be back
where things make sense,

1765
02:10:56,258 --> 02:10:58,759
where I won't have to be afraid all the time.

1766
02:11:01,638 --> 02:11:03,722
Only one thing stops me.

1767
02:11:04,766 --> 02:11:06,851
A promise I made to Andy.

1768
02:11:27,582 --> 02:11:29,666
Here it is.

1769
02:11:39,468 --> 02:11:41,553
Much obliged, sir.

1770
02:15:20,360 --> 02:15:21,652
Dear Red,

1771
02:15:21,736 --> 02:15:24,196
if you're reading this, you've gotten out.

1772
02:15:24,280 --> 02:15:28,534
And if you've come this far,
maybe you're willing to come a little further.

1773
02:15:28,618 --> 02:15:31,203
You remember the name of the town, don't you?

1774
02:15:33,498 --> 02:15:35,582
Zihuatanejo.

1775
02:15:36,626 --> 02:15:37,835
I could use a good man

1776
02:15:37,919 --> 02:15:39,962
to help me get my project on wheels.

1777
02:15:40,046 --> 02:15:42,172
I'll keep an eye out for you

1778
02:15:42,257 --> 02:15:44,299
and the chessboard ready.

1779
02:15:45,343 --> 02:15:46,718
Remember, Red,

1780
02:15:46,803 --> 02:15:48,846
hope is a good thing.

1781
02:15:48,930 --> 02:15:50,973
Maybe the best of things.

1782
02:15:51,057 --> 02:15:53,142
And no good thing ever dies.

1783
02:15:54,185 --> 02:15:56,645
I will be hoping that this letter finds you

1784
02:15:56,729 --> 02:15:58,772
and finds you well.

1785
02:15:58,857 --> 02:16:01,358
Your friend, Andy.

1786
02:16:35,936 --> 02:16:39,814
Get busy living or get busy dying.

1787
02:16:42,318 --> 02:16:44,402
That's goddamn right.

1788
02:16:49,909 --> 02:16:52,035
For the second time in my life,

1789
02:16:52,119 --> 02:16:54,204
I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1790
02:16:55,873 --> 02:16:57,957
Parole violation.

1791
02:16:57,958 --> 02:17:01,669
Of course, I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

1792
02:17:02,922 --> 02:17:04,964
Not for an old crook like me.

1793
02:17:05,049 --> 02:17:07,133
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1794
02:17:10,846 --> 02:17:14,975
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still
or hold a thought in my head.

1795
02:17:16,019 --> 02:17:19,021
I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.

1796
02:17:19,105 --> 02:17:21,815
A free man at the start of a long journey

1797
02:17:21,900 --> 02:17:24,818
whose conclusion is uncertain.

1798
02:17:27,697 --> 02:17:29,865
I hope I can make it across the border.

1799
02:17:31,743 --> 02:17:34,536
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.

1800
02:17:36,915 --> 02:17:40,125
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

1801
02:17:42,879 --> 02:17:44,755
I hope.
