â™ª THE INK SPOTS: If I Didn't Care

2
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:28,284
â™ª If I didn't care

3
00:00:29,537 --> 00:00:33,790
â™ª More than words can say

4
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:39,045
â™ª If I didn't care

5
00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:44,259
â™ª Would I feel this way?

6
00:00:45,427 --> 00:00:49,472
â™ª If this isn't love

7
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:55,103
â™ª Then why do I thrill?

8
00:00:56,522 --> 00:01:02,277
â™ª And what makes my head
go round and round

9
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:07,156
â™ª While my heart stands still?

10
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:10,869
â™ª If I didn't care

11
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:15,790
â™ª Would it be the same?

12
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:23,548
â™ª Would my every prayer begin and end

13
00:01:23,632 --> 00:01:26,551
â™ª With just your name?

14
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,431
â™ª And would I be sure

15
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:37,395
â™ª That this is love beyond compare?

16
00:01:39,064 --> 00:01:41,107
â™ª Would all this be true

17
00:01:42,526 --> 00:01:47,614
â™ª If I didn't care for you?

18
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:07,634
Mr. Dufresne,

19
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:11,971
describe the confrontation you had
with your wife the night she was murdered.

20
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:18,728
It was very bitter.

21
00:02:18,812 --> 00:02:23,232
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around...

22
00:02:24,652 --> 00:02:28,196
And she said she wanted a divorce in Reno.

23
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,114
What was your response?

24
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:32,158
I told her I would not grant one.

25
00:02:32,242 --> 00:02:35,286
"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."

26
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:39,040
Those were the words you used, Mr. Dufresne,
according to your neighbors.

27
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:43,836
If they say so.
I really don't remember. I was upset.

28
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:48,466
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

29
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,468
She packed a bag.

30
00:02:51,553 --> 00:02:54,722
She packed a bag to go and stay with...
Mr. Quentin.

31
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,100
DA: Glenn Quentin.

32
00:02:57,184 --> 00:02:59,268
Golf pro at the Snowdon Hills Country Club.

33
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:03,231
The man you discovered was your wife's lover.

34
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,359
Did you follow her?

35
00:03:07,611 --> 00:03:09,779
I went to a few bars first.

36
00:03:09,863 --> 00:03:12,740
Later, I drove to his house to confront them.

37
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:16,411
They weren't home, so I...parked in the turnout,

38
00:03:16,495 --> 00:03:18,079
and waited.

39
00:03:18,163 --> 00:03:20,373
DA: With what intention?

40
00:03:20,457 --> 00:03:22,250
DUFRESNE: I'm not sure.

41
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:24,544
I was confused.

42
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:26,295
Drunk.

43
00:03:28,048 --> 00:03:31,050
I think...mostly, I wanted to scare them.

44
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:34,387
When they arrived,
you went up to the house and murdered them.

45
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:37,557
No. I was sobering up.

46
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:40,393
I got back in the car,
and I drove home to sleep it off.

47
00:03:40,477 --> 00:03:43,938
Along the way, I stopped,
and I threw my gun into the Royal River.

48
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,232
I feel I've been very clear on this point.

49
00:03:46,316 --> 00:03:50,111
Well, where I get hazy is where the cleaning
woman shows up the following morning

50
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:55,867
and finds your wife in bed with her lover,
riddled with .38 caliber bullets.

51
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,164
Now, does that strike you as a fantastic
coincidence, Mr. Dufresne, or is it just me?

52
00:04:01,248 --> 00:04:03,082
(Whispers) Yes, it does.

53
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:09,255
Yet you still maintain that you threw your gun
into the river before the murders took place?

54
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:13,134
- That's very convenient.
- It's the truth.

55
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:17,930
DA: The police dragged that river
for three days, and nary a gun was found.

56
00:04:18,015 --> 00:04:20,808
So, there could be no comparison made
between your gun

57
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:25,063
and the bullets taken from
the bloodstained corpses of the victims.

58
00:04:26,356 --> 00:04:29,233
And that also...

59
00:04:29,318 --> 00:04:31,319
is very convenient.

60
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:32,904
Isnâ€™t it, Mr. Dufresne?

61
00:04:34,114 --> 00:04:36,365
Since I am innocent of this crime, sir,

62
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,036
I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

63
00:04:41,205 --> 00:04:43,289
â™ª THE INK SPOTS: If I Didn't Care

64
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:50,463
â™ª And would I be sure that this

65
00:04:50,547 --> 00:04:55,176
â™ª Is love beyond compare...

66
00:04:57,387 --> 00:04:58,638
(Switches off radio)

67
00:04:58,722 --> 00:05:01,641
DA: Ladies and gentlemen,
you've heard all the evidence.

68
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:04,310
We have the accused at the scene of the crime.

69
00:05:04,394 --> 00:05:06,229
We have footprints, tire tracks,

70
00:05:06,313 --> 00:05:10,358
bullets strewn on the ground which bear
his fingerprints, a broken bourbon bottle,

71
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:12,568
likewise with fingerprints.

72
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:14,320
And most of all,

73
00:05:14,404 --> 00:05:16,697
we have a beautiful young woman and her lover

74
00:05:16,782 --> 00:05:18,866
lying dead in each other's arms.

75
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,204
They had sinned.

76
00:05:24,832 --> 00:05:28,835
But was their crime so great
as to merit a death sentence?

77
00:05:30,003 --> 00:05:32,088
Now, while you think about that...

78
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:36,300
..think about this.

79
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:38,928
A revolver holds six bullets.

80
00:05:39,012 --> 00:05:40,388
Not eight.

81
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:43,933
I submit that this was not a hot-blooded
crime of passion.

82
00:05:44,017 --> 00:05:47,061
That could be understood, if not condoned.

83
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,772
No. This was revenge...

84
00:05:49,857 --> 00:05:54,360
of a much more brutal
and cold-blooded nature. Consider this.

85
00:05:54,444 --> 00:05:56,988
Four bullets per victim.

86
00:05:57,072 --> 00:05:59,448
Not six shots fired, but eight.

87
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:03,452
That means that he fired the gun empty,

88
00:06:03,537 --> 00:06:05,830
and then stopped to reload...

89
00:06:06,915 --> 00:06:09,500
..so that he could shoot each of them again.

90
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:12,170
An extra bullet per lover.

91
00:06:12,254 --> 00:06:14,297
Right in the head.

92
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:17,258
(Both panting)

93
00:06:18,343 --> 00:06:23,264
You strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

94
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:25,600
It chills my blood just to look at you.

95
00:06:27,352 --> 00:06:30,313
By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine,

96
00:06:30,397 --> 00:06:33,941
I hereby order you to serve two life sentences,
back to back.

97
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,653
One for each of your victims. So be it.

98
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:39,822
(Gavel bangs)

99
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:04,347
Sit.

100
00:07:08,393 --> 00:07:11,312
We see by your file
you've served 20 years of a life sentence.

101
00:07:11,396 --> 00:07:12,980
Yes, sir.

102
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,524
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

103
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:17,818
Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

104
00:07:19,446 --> 00:07:21,405
I mean, I learned my lesson.

105
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:25,743
I can honestly say...I'm a changed man.

106
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:31,791
I'm no longer a danger to society.

107
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,960
That's God's honest truth.

108
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,915
Hey, Red. How'd it go?

109
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,626
Same old shit. Different day.

110
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:19,338
Yeah. I know how you feel.
I'm up for rejection next week.

111
00:08:20,507 --> 00:08:23,092
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

112
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:24,468
It happens.

113
00:08:24,553 --> 00:08:26,137
Hey, Red. Bump me a deck.

114
00:08:26,221 --> 00:08:29,598
Get the fuck out of my face, will you, man?
You've had five packs already.

115
00:08:29,683 --> 00:08:30,891
- Four.
- Five.

116
00:08:31,935 --> 00:08:35,479
RED: There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.

117
00:08:35,564 --> 00:08:37,481
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

118
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:40,693
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer - if that's your thing -

119
00:08:40,777 --> 00:08:44,363
a bottle of brandy
to celebrate your kid's high-school graduation.

120
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:46,782
Damn near anything, within reason.

121
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:49,160
Yes, sir. I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

122
00:08:49,244 --> 00:08:51,370
(Siren wails)

123
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:56,876
So, when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949

124
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,296
and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth
into the prison for him,

125
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,465
I told him, "No problem."

126
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:46,842
Andy came to Shawshank Prison

127
00:09:46,927 --> 00:09:51,055
in early 1947, for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

128
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:55,434
On the outside he had been vice-president
of a large Portland bank.

129
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,520
Good work for a man as young as he was.

130
00:09:57,604 --> 00:09:59,688
(Applause and whistling)

131
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:04,568
Hey, Red.

132
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,322
(Whistling)

133
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,574
(Men cheering)

134
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:36,434
(Men shouting and jeering)

135
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,275
Do you speak English, butt steak?
You follow this officer.

136
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,162
(Men shouting)

137
00:10:57,247 --> 00:11:01,625
I haven't seen such a sorry-looking heap
of m-m-maggot shit in all my life.

138
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,794
MAN: Hey, fish! Come over here.

139
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:21,729
(Shouting)
- Come on, fish.

140
00:11:27,194 --> 00:11:29,111
Taking bets today, Red?

141
00:11:29,196 --> 00:11:31,197
Smokes or coins? Better's choice.

142
00:11:31,281 --> 00:11:33,073
Smokes. Put me down for two.

143
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:35,201
All right. Who's your horse?

144
00:11:35,285 --> 00:11:38,579
That little sack of shit...eighth from the front.

145
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:39,830
He'll be first.

146
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:42,124
- Bullshit. I'll take that action.
- Me too.

147
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:44,460
You're out some smokes, son. Let me tell you.

148
00:11:44,544 --> 00:11:46,462
Heywood, you're so smart, you call it.

149
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:49,048
I'll take...t-t-the chubby fat-ass there.

150
00:11:49,132 --> 00:11:52,510
The fifth one from the front.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

151
00:11:52,594 --> 00:11:55,471
(Men shouting)
- Fresh fish!

152
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:59,642
Fresh fish today! We're reeling them in!

153
00:11:59,726 --> 00:12:03,979
RED: I must admit, I didn't think much of Andy,
first time I laid eyes on him.

154
00:12:04,064 --> 00:12:07,566
Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.

155
00:12:07,651 --> 00:12:09,944
That was my first impression of the man.

156
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:11,737
MAN: What do you say, Red?

157
00:12:11,821 --> 00:12:15,074
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

158
00:12:15,158 --> 00:12:17,326
That guy? Never happen.

159
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,536
Ten cigarettes.

160
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,787
That's a rich bet.

161
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:22,081
All right. Who's gonna prove me wrong?

162
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:24,250
Heywood? Jigger?

163
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:25,793
Skeet?

164
00:12:25,877 --> 00:12:28,087
Floyd?

165
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:30,297
Four brave souls.

166
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:33,217
TANNOY:
Return to your cell blocks for evening count.

167
00:12:33,301 --> 00:12:35,803
All prisoners return to your cell blocks.

168
00:12:56,908 --> 00:12:58,993
Turn to the right. Eyes front.

169
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:15,426
This is Mr. Hadley. He's Captain of the Guards.

170
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,678
I'm Mr. Norton, the Warden.

171
00:13:17,762 --> 00:13:20,264
You are convicted felons.

172
00:13:20,348 --> 00:13:22,683
That's why they've sent you to me.

173
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:24,393
Rule number one:

174
00:13:24,477 --> 00:13:26,353
No blasphemy.

175
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:29,982
I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain
in my prison.

176
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:31,442
The other rules...

177
00:13:31,526 --> 00:13:33,235
you'll figure out as you go along.

178
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,112
Any questions?

179
00:13:35,196 --> 00:13:36,405
When do we eat?

180
00:13:44,914 --> 00:13:47,082
HADLEY: You eat when we say you eat!

181
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:50,544
You shit when we say you shit,
and you piss when we say you piss.

182
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,505
You got that, you maggot-dick motherfucker?

183
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,882
Aarghh!

184
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:56,925
On your feet.

185
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,802
NORTON: I believe in two things.

186
00:13:58,887 --> 00:14:01,764
Discipline and the Bible.

187
00:14:01,848 --> 00:14:03,682
Here you'll receive both.

188
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:07,436
Put your trust in the Lord.

189
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,396
Your ass belongs to me.

190
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,567
Welcome to Shawshank.

191
00:14:18,698 --> 00:14:20,115
Unhook 'em.

192
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:27,247
Turn around.

193
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,006
That's enough.

194
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:38,842
Move to the end of the cage.

195
00:14:38,927 --> 00:14:40,302
Turn around.

196
00:14:40,387 --> 00:14:41,637
Delouse him.

197
00:14:42,847 --> 00:14:44,723
Turn around.

198
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,479
Move out of the cage, go left.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

199
00:14:50,563 --> 00:14:52,106
Next man up.

200
00:14:54,234 --> 00:14:57,403
To the right. Right, right, right.

201
00:14:57,487 --> 00:14:59,029
Left, left...

202
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:03,283
RED: The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.

203
00:15:03,368 --> 00:15:06,495
They march you in,
naked as the day you were born,

204
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:10,666
skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit they throw on you.

205
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,711
And when they put you in that cell,

206
00:15:13,795 --> 00:15:16,463
and those bars slam home...

207
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,299
that's when you know it's for real.

208
00:15:19,384 --> 00:15:22,720
Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.

209
00:15:22,804 --> 00:15:24,012
Nothing left,

210
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:26,807
but all the time in the world to think about it.

211
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:31,812
Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.

212
00:15:31,896 --> 00:15:35,190
Somebody always breaks down crying.

213
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:37,735
Happens every time.

214
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:39,903
The only question is:

215
00:15:39,988 --> 00:15:41,405
Who's it gonna be?

216
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,075
It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.

217
00:15:46,995 --> 00:15:49,079
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

218
00:15:58,715 --> 00:16:00,340
Lights out!

219
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:03,093
(Click of light switches)

220
00:16:20,862 --> 00:16:23,947
RED: I remember my first night.

221
00:16:24,032 --> 00:16:26,116
Seems like a long time ago.

222
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,120
MAN: Yoo-hoo!

223
00:16:30,205 --> 00:16:32,706
Hey, fish.

224
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,834
Fish, fish, fish, fish, fishy.

225
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,838
- Boy, are you scared of the dark?
- You like it here, new fish?

226
00:16:39,923 --> 00:16:42,257
You'll wish
your daddy never dicked your mommy.

227
00:16:42,342 --> 00:16:46,345
Fishy! Oh, I want me a pork chop. Oh, yes!

228
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:51,475
You taking this down, new fish?
There's gonna be a quiz later!

229
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:54,937
- Poke your ass out, give me a first look!
- Shh! Keep it down.

230
00:16:55,021 --> 00:16:58,357
RED: The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.

231
00:16:58,441 --> 00:17:00,484
They don't quit till they reel someone in.

232
00:17:00,568 --> 00:17:03,070
(Men whispering in background)

233
00:17:03,154 --> 00:17:05,656
Hey, Fat Ass.

234
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,407
Fat Ass.

235
00:17:08,618 --> 00:17:11,078
Talk to me, boy.

236
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:13,872
I know you're there. I can hear you breathing.

237
00:17:13,957 --> 00:17:16,875
Don't you listen to these nitwits.
You hear me?

238
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,044
This place ain't so bad.

239
00:17:19,128 --> 00:17:20,754
I tell you what.

240
00:17:21,923 --> 00:17:25,092
I'll introduce you around.
Make you feel right at home.

241
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:27,761
I know a couple of big old bull queers

242
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:30,806
that would just love to make your acquaintance.

243
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,309
Especially that big, white,
m-mushy butt of yours.

244
00:17:34,394 --> 00:17:36,311
God!

245
00:17:36,396 --> 00:17:37,896
I don't belong here!

246
00:17:37,981 --> 00:17:39,398
MAN: We have a winner!

247
00:17:39,482 --> 00:17:41,233
FAT ASS: I wanna go home!

248
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:43,151
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

249
00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:46,405
Hey, it's the fat guy! It's the fat guy!

250
00:17:46,489 --> 00:17:50,325
Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Fresh fish!

251
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:53,120
FAT ASS: I don't belong here!

252
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:54,413
ALL: Fresh fish!

253
00:17:54,497 --> 00:17:57,833
I wanna go home. I want my mommy.

254
00:17:57,917 --> 00:18:00,919
MAN: I had your mother. She wasn't that great.

255
00:18:01,004 --> 00:18:02,504
(Men chanting) Fresh fish!

256
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:04,256
(Door opens)

257
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,134
What the Christ is this happy horse shit?

258
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:09,928
He took the Lord's name in vain.
I'm telling the Warden.

259
00:18:10,013 --> 00:18:11,513
With my baton up your ass!

260
00:18:11,598 --> 00:18:13,265
FAT ASS: Let me out of here!

261
00:18:13,349 --> 00:18:16,727
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

262
00:18:16,811 --> 00:18:17,978
FAT ASS: Please...

263
00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:20,105
I ain't supposed to be here.

264
00:18:20,189 --> 00:18:21,565
Not me!

265
00:18:21,649 --> 00:18:24,109
I ain't gonna count to three, or even one.

266
00:18:24,193 --> 00:18:26,486
Shut the fuck up, or I'll sing you a lullaby!

267
00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:28,405
(Whispers) Shut up, man. Shut up.

268
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:29,781
There's been a mistake!

269
00:18:29,866 --> 00:18:33,035
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here!

270
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,202
Open that cell.

271
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:38,457
MAN: Me neither.
You people run this place like a fucking prison!

272
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,966
HADLEY: Son of a bitch.

273
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:49,927
(Thuds)

274
00:18:50,011 --> 00:18:52,054
(Whimpering)

275
00:18:52,138 --> 00:18:54,222
PRISONER: Take it easy.

276
00:18:59,562 --> 00:19:01,229
(Yelps)

277
00:19:16,996 --> 00:19:20,374
If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here
the rest of the night,

278
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:24,127
I swear by God and sonny Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

279
00:19:24,212 --> 00:19:26,296
Every last motherfucker in here.

280
00:19:30,218 --> 00:19:33,887
Call the trustees.
Take that tub of shit down to the infirmary.

281
00:19:48,194 --> 00:19:52,906
RED: His first night in the joint,
Andy Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.

282
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,867
He never made a sound.

283
00:19:58,746 --> 00:20:00,831
(Gate buzzer)

284
00:20:11,384 --> 00:20:14,636
GUARD: Tier 3 North. Clear.

285
00:20:14,721 --> 00:20:16,888
Tier 2 South. Clear.

286
00:20:16,973 --> 00:20:18,849
Tier 3 South. Clear.

287
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:20,892
Tier 1 North...

288
00:20:20,977 --> 00:20:23,770
- Tier 1 South. Clear.
- Tier 4 South. Clear.

289
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,939
Prepare to roll out.

290
00:20:29,318 --> 00:20:31,403
GUARD: Roll out!

291
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:27,084
Are... Are you going to eat that?

292
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:30,087
I hadn't... I hadn't planned on it.

293
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:32,380
Do you mind?

294
00:21:39,722 --> 00:21:42,349
Ah...that's nice and ripe.

295
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,189
(Chirps)

296
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,404
Jake says thank you.

297
00:21:56,489 --> 00:21:58,907
Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.

298
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,705
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

299
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,582
Oh, no, no. Here he comes.

300
00:22:10,711 --> 00:22:14,631
Morning, fellas. Fine morning, ain't it?

301
00:22:14,715 --> 00:22:17,134
You know why it's a fine morning, don't you?

302
00:22:17,218 --> 00:22:19,636
Come on. Set 'em down.
I want 'em all lined up here,

303
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,514
just like a pretty little chorus line.

304
00:22:22,598 --> 00:22:24,683
Yeah, look at that!

305
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:27,644
- Look at that. Oh, Lord!
- I can't stand this guy.

306
00:22:27,728 --> 00:22:28,770
(Inhales)

307
00:22:28,855 --> 00:22:31,523
Yes. Richmond, Virginia.

308
00:22:31,607 --> 00:22:33,692
- Smell my ass!
- After he smells mine.

309
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:39,114
Gee, Red, it was a terrible shame
about your horse coming in last, an' all.

310
00:22:39,198 --> 00:22:42,409
But I sure do love that winning horse of mine,
though.

311
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:45,203
I owe that boy a great big, sloppy kiss
when I see him.

312
00:22:45,288 --> 00:22:48,290
Why don't you give him some of your cigarettes,
instead?

313
00:22:48,374 --> 00:22:50,167
Lucky fuck.

314
00:22:50,251 --> 00:22:51,960
Hey, Tyrell.

315
00:22:52,044 --> 00:22:55,005
You pull infirmary duty this week?

316
00:22:55,089 --> 00:22:56,798
How's that horse of mine doing?

317
00:22:56,883 --> 00:22:58,341
Dead.

318
00:22:58,426 --> 00:23:03,805
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.
The doc had already gone home for the night.

319
00:23:03,806 --> 00:23:06,558
Poor bastard lay there till this morning.

320
00:23:06,642 --> 00:23:09,477
By then, hell, there weren't nothing we could do.

321
00:23:15,276 --> 00:23:16,860
What was his name?

322
00:23:20,114 --> 00:23:21,489
What did you say?

323
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:25,744
I was just wondering if anyone knew his name.

324
00:23:25,828 --> 00:23:28,538
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

325
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:33,376
It doesn't fuckin' matter what his name was.
He's dead.

326
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,065
Hey...

327
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:57,901
Anybody come at you yet?

328
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:01,404
Anybody get to you yet?

329
00:24:02,531 --> 00:24:05,575
Hey, we all need friends in here.

330
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,577
I could be a friend to you.

331
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:11,706
Hey...

332
00:24:16,545 --> 00:24:18,421
Hard to get.

333
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:21,758
I like that.

334
00:24:28,391 --> 00:24:31,685
RED: Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.

335
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:34,229
I guess he had a lot on his mind,

336
00:24:34,313 --> 00:24:36,523
trying to adapt to life on the inside.

337
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:40,777
It wasn't until a month went by
that he opened his mouth

338
00:24:40,861 --> 00:24:43,154
to say more than two words to somebody.

339
00:24:45,074 --> 00:24:47,117
As it turned out...

340
00:24:47,201 --> 00:24:49,119
that somebody was me.

341
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:56,876
TANNOY: Officers Russell and Burwell
report to the duty officer.

342
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,672
I'm Andy Dufresne.

343
00:25:00,756 --> 00:25:02,841
The wife-killing banker.

344
00:25:04,677 --> 00:25:06,386
Why did you do it?

345
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,096
I didn't, since you ask.

346
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,224
(Laughs) You're gonna fit right in!

347
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:14,477
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

348
00:25:14,562 --> 00:25:17,897
- Heywood, what are you in here for?
- Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

349
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:23,611
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

350
00:25:23,696 --> 00:25:27,449
You think your shit smells sweeter than most.
Is that right?

351
00:25:27,533 --> 00:25:29,868
- What do you think?
- To tell you the truth,

352
00:25:29,952 --> 00:25:33,038
I haven't made up my mind. (Chuckles)

353
00:25:33,122 --> 00:25:37,208
I understand
you're a man that knows how to get things.

354
00:25:37,293 --> 00:25:40,795
I'm known to locate certain things,
from time to time.

355
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,882
- I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.
- A what?

356
00:25:43,966 --> 00:25:45,342
A rock hammer.

357
00:25:45,426 --> 00:25:47,719
- What is it, and why?
- What do you care?

358
00:25:49,597 --> 00:25:52,474
Well, if it was a toothbrush, I'd just quote a price,

359
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:55,143
but then a toothbrush is a non-lethal object.

360
00:25:56,562 --> 00:25:58,271
Fair enough.

361
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,815
A rock hammer
is about six or seven inches long.

362
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,525
Looks like a miniature pickaxe.

363
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,735
Pickaxe?

364
00:26:03,819 --> 00:26:05,904
- For rocks.
- Rocks.

365
00:26:07,573 --> 00:26:09,741
Quartz?

366
00:26:09,825 --> 00:26:11,493
Quartz.

367
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:15,121
And some mica.

368
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,373
Shale.

369
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:19,042
Limestone.

370
00:26:19,126 --> 00:26:21,044
So?

371
00:26:21,128 --> 00:26:23,213
So, I'm a rock hound.

372
00:26:23,297 --> 00:26:26,508
At least, I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again on a limited basis.

373
00:26:26,592 --> 00:26:28,718
Or maybe you want
to hammer somebody's skull.

374
00:26:28,803 --> 00:26:30,261
No, sir.

375
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:32,972
I have no enemies here.

376
00:26:33,057 --> 00:26:35,433
No? Wait a while.

377
00:26:36,977 --> 00:26:39,145
Word gets around.

378
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,357
The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.

379
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:44,234
Especially Bogs.

380
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:49,531
I don't suppose it would help any
if I explained to them I'm not homosexual.

381
00:26:49,615 --> 00:26:51,116
RED: Neither are they.

382
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,910
You have to be human first. They don't qualify.

383
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:03,711
Bull queers take by force.
It's all they want or understand.

384
00:27:03,796 --> 00:27:07,424
If I were you,
I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.

385
00:27:07,508 --> 00:27:08,842
Thanks for the advice.

386
00:27:08,926 --> 00:27:10,510
Well, that's free.

387
00:27:10,594 --> 00:27:12,846
You understand my concern.

388
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,473
Well, if there's any trouble,
I won't use the hammer.

389
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:19,769
Then I guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

390
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,022
Did I miss something? What's funny?

391
00:27:23,107 --> 00:27:26,151
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

392
00:27:28,028 --> 00:27:30,029
What's an item like this usually go for?

393
00:27:30,114 --> 00:27:33,158
Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.

394
00:27:33,242 --> 00:27:35,952
My normal mark-up's 20 per cent.

395
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:38,496
But this is a specialty item.

396
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:41,166
The risk goes up, the price goes up.

397
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:43,126
Let's make it an even ten bucks.

398
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,086
Ten it is.

399
00:27:46,172 --> 00:27:48,590
Waste of money, if you ask me.

400
00:27:48,674 --> 00:27:50,216
Why's that?

401
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:54,345
Folks around this joint love surprise inspections.

402
00:27:55,931 --> 00:27:58,224
If they find it, you're gonna lose it.

403
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,435
If they do catch you with it, you don't know me.

404
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:02,729
Mention my name, we never do business again.

405
00:28:02,813 --> 00:28:05,940
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now, you got that?

406
00:28:07,443 --> 00:28:08,860
I understand.

407
00:28:08,944 --> 00:28:10,361
Thank you...

408
00:28:10,362 --> 00:28:11,988
Mr. er...?

409
00:28:12,072 --> 00:28:14,532
Red. The name's Red.

410
00:28:14,533 --> 00:28:15,575
Red?

411
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:18,411
Why do they call you that?

412
00:28:22,082 --> 00:28:24,167
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

413
00:28:32,134 --> 00:28:35,178
RED: I could see
why some of the boys took him for snobby.

414
00:28:35,262 --> 00:28:38,681
He had a quiet way about him.

415
00:28:38,766 --> 00:28:43,228
A walk and a talk
that just wasn't normal around here.

416
00:28:43,312 --> 00:28:44,854
He strolled...

417
00:28:44,939 --> 00:28:49,275
like a man in a park,
without a care or worry in the world.

418
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,072
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

419
00:28:54,156 --> 00:28:58,326
Yeah. I think it would be fair to say...

420
00:28:58,327 --> 00:29:00,411
I liked Andy from the start.

421
00:29:02,164 --> 00:29:05,375
Let's go!
Some of us have got a schedule to keep.

422
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:10,755
Move it! Come on. Move it!

423
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:17,512
Bob, how are you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

424
00:29:27,231 --> 00:29:28,690
Easy.

425
00:29:28,774 --> 00:29:30,858
Keep it moving.

426
00:29:33,654 --> 00:29:34,904
Red...

427
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:59,637
RED: Andy was right. I finally got the joke.

428
00:29:59,722 --> 00:30:04,225
It would take a man about 600 years
to tunnel under the wall with one of these.

429
00:30:08,564 --> 00:30:09,689
Book?

430
00:30:09,773 --> 00:30:11,649
Not today.

431
00:30:16,989 --> 00:30:19,073
- Book?
- No.

432
00:30:20,868 --> 00:30:22,076
Hey, Brooksy.

433
00:30:25,372 --> 00:30:27,457
Delivery for Dufresne.

434
00:30:34,548 --> 00:30:40,178
Book?

435
00:30:43,182 --> 00:30:45,308
Dufresne...

436
00:30:45,392 --> 00:30:47,560
Here's your book.

437
00:30:51,982 --> 00:30:53,650
Thanks.

438
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,698
Dufresne! We're running low on Hexlite.

439
00:31:00,783 --> 00:31:02,867
Get on back and fetch us up some.

440
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:42,031
If you get this in your eyes, it blinds you.

441
00:31:42,116 --> 00:31:44,867
Honey...hush.

442
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:53,835
(Groans)

443
00:31:56,922 --> 00:31:59,340
That's it. You fight.

444
00:31:59,425 --> 00:32:01,008
It's better that way.

445
00:32:01,093 --> 00:32:02,885
(Screaming and yelling)

446
00:32:09,435 --> 00:32:12,270
RED: I wish I could tell you
that Andy fought the good fight,

447
00:32:12,354 --> 00:32:14,897
and the Sisters let him be.

448
00:32:14,982 --> 00:32:16,983
I wish I could tell you that.

449
00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:19,152
But prison is no fairy-tale world.

450
00:32:21,113 --> 00:32:23,239
He never said who did it.

451
00:32:23,323 --> 00:32:26,367
But we all knew.

452
00:32:26,452 --> 00:32:28,327
(Gate buzzer)

453
00:32:29,705 --> 00:32:32,582
Things went on like that for a while.

454
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:35,293
Prison life consists of routine...

455
00:32:35,377 --> 00:32:37,587
and then more routine.

456
00:32:39,965 --> 00:32:43,801
Every so often,
Andy would show up with fresh bruises.

457
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,013
The Sisters kept at him.

458
00:32:47,097 --> 00:32:51,225
Sometimes he was able to fight 'em off.
Sometimes not.

459
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:54,562
And that's how it went for Andy.

460
00:32:54,646 --> 00:32:57,190
That was his routine.

461
00:32:57,274 --> 00:33:01,068
I do believe
those first two years were the worst for him.

462
00:33:01,153 --> 00:33:03,404
And I also believe,

463
00:33:03,489 --> 00:33:08,034
if things had gone on that way,
this place would have got the best of him.

464
00:33:08,118 --> 00:33:11,078
But then, in the spring of 1949,

465
00:33:11,163 --> 00:33:13,164
the powers that be decided that...

466
00:33:13,248 --> 00:33:16,667
The roof of the license-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

467
00:33:16,752 --> 00:33:19,504
I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.

468
00:33:20,672 --> 00:33:22,799
As you know,

469
00:33:22,883 --> 00:33:26,594
special detail carries with it special privileges.

470
00:33:26,678 --> 00:33:28,763
RED: It was outdoor detail...

471
00:33:30,265 --> 00:33:33,851
..and May is one damn fine month
to be working outdoors.

472
00:33:33,936 --> 00:33:35,561
Stay in line there.

473
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:38,564
More than a hundred men
volunteered for the job.

474
00:33:40,067 --> 00:33:41,734
(Whispers)

475
00:33:42,945 --> 00:33:45,238
Wallace E Unger.

476
00:33:46,406 --> 00:33:48,866
Ellis Redding.

477
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:51,786
Wouldn't you know it?

478
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,455
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names.

479
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,624
GUARD: Andrew Dufresne.

480
00:33:56,708 --> 00:34:00,253
RED: It only cost us a pack of smokes per man.

481
00:34:00,337 --> 00:34:03,047
I made my usual 20 per cent, of course.

482
00:34:03,131 --> 00:34:06,717
HADLEY: So, this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

483
00:34:06,802 --> 00:34:08,511
I say, "Yeah?"

484
00:34:08,595 --> 00:34:12,306
He says, "Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

485
00:34:12,391 --> 00:34:14,892
Oh, damn, Byron. I'm sorry to hear that.

486
00:34:14,977 --> 00:34:16,352
I'm not. He was an asshole.

487
00:34:16,436 --> 00:34:18,771
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead, anyway.

488
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:22,817
So, anyway, this lawyer fella says to me,
"Your brother died a rich man."

489
00:34:22,901 --> 00:34:25,611
Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks.

490
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:28,155
GUARD: A million bucks?

491
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,616
Fucking incredible
how lucky some assholes get.

492
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:33,244
Jeez-Louise! Are you gonna see any of that?

493
00:34:33,328 --> 00:34:36,414
35,000. That's what he left me.

494
00:34:36,498 --> 00:34:38,416
- Dollars?
- Yeah.

495
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,627
Holy shit! That's great.
That's like winning the sweepstakes.

496
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:42,920
Isnâ€™t it?

497
00:34:43,005 --> 00:34:46,048
Dumb shit. What do you think
the government's gonna do to me?

498
00:34:46,133 --> 00:34:48,676
Take a big, wet bite out of my ass, is what.

499
00:34:48,677 --> 00:34:52,847
Poor Byron! Terrible fucking luck, huh?

500
00:34:52,931 --> 00:34:55,600
RED: Crying shame.

501
00:34:55,684 --> 00:34:57,351
Some people really got it awful!

502
00:34:57,436 --> 00:34:58,978
Andy, are you nuts?

503
00:34:59,062 --> 00:35:01,188
Keep your eyes on your mop, man. Andy!

504
00:35:01,189 --> 00:35:04,233
GUARD: Well, you'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up...

505
00:35:04,318 --> 00:35:07,153
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Maybe enough to buy a new car. Then what?

506
00:35:07,237 --> 00:35:09,614
I've got to pay tax on the car.

507
00:35:09,698 --> 00:35:13,576
Repair, maintenance, goddamn kids
pestering me to take them for a ride...

508
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:17,580
And at the end of the year, you figure the tax
wrong, you pay them out of your own pocket.

509
00:35:17,664 --> 00:35:19,832
I tell you...Uncle Sam!

510
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:23,669
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

511
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:26,464
- Andy! Andy!
- What's he doing?

512
00:35:26,548 --> 00:35:28,883
- Getting himself killed.
- Keep tarring.

513
00:35:28,967 --> 00:35:32,053
Some brother! Shit. (Spits)

514
00:35:32,137 --> 00:35:33,179
Hey!

515
00:35:36,516 --> 00:35:38,726
Mr. Hadley...

516
00:35:38,727 --> 00:35:40,186
do you trust your wife?

517
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,481
Oh, that's funny.

518
00:35:43,565 --> 00:35:46,442
You're gonna look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

519
00:35:46,526 --> 00:35:49,987
I mean, do you think
she'd go behind your back, try to hamstring you?

520
00:35:51,073 --> 00:35:52,949
That's it. Step aside, Mert.

521
00:35:53,033 --> 00:35:54,533
This fucker's having an accident.

522
00:35:54,618 --> 00:35:55,785
He's gonna push him off.

523
00:35:55,869 --> 00:35:59,997
Cos if you do trust her,
there's no reason you can't keep that 35,000.

524
00:36:00,082 --> 00:36:01,958
- What did you say?
- 35,000.

525
00:36:02,042 --> 00:36:03,751
- 35,000?
- All of it.

526
00:36:03,752 --> 00:36:06,087
- All of it?
- Every penny.

527
00:36:06,171 --> 00:36:08,005
You'd better start making sense.

528
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,424
If you want to keep the money,
give it to your wife.

529
00:36:10,509 --> 00:36:14,637
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

530
00:36:14,721 --> 00:36:16,263
Bullshit! Tax-free?

531
00:36:16,264 --> 00:36:19,433
Tax-free. The IRS can't touch one cent.

532
00:36:19,518 --> 00:36:22,103
You're the smart banker what killed his wife.

533
00:36:22,187 --> 00:36:25,731
Why should I believe a smart banker like you?
So I can end up in here with you?

534
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,316
It's legal. Ask the IRS.

535
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:30,611
They'll say the same thing.
But I feel stupid telling you this.

536
00:36:30,696 --> 00:36:32,989
I'm sure you would have investigated the matter.

537
00:36:33,073 --> 00:36:37,159
Yeah, I don't need no banker to tell me
where the bears shit in the buckwheat.

538
00:36:37,244 --> 00:36:40,287
Of course not, but you do need someone
to set up the tax-free gift.

539
00:36:40,372 --> 00:36:42,248
It'll cost you. A lawyer.

540
00:36:42,332 --> 00:36:44,667
A bunch of ball-washing bastards.

541
00:36:44,751 --> 00:36:48,587
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

542
00:36:48,588 --> 00:36:50,965
If you get the forms, I'll prepare them for you.

543
00:36:51,049 --> 00:36:52,925
Nearly free of charge.

544
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:57,388
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my co-workers.

545
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,890
GUARD:
Co-workers! Get him! That's rich, ain't it?

546
00:36:59,975 --> 00:37:03,436
I think a man working outdoors
feels more like a man

547
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,271
if he can have a bottle of suds.

548
00:37:05,355 --> 00:37:08,399
That's only my opinion...sir.

549
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,362
What are you jimmies staring at?

550
00:37:13,447 --> 00:37:14,447
Back to work!

551
00:37:14,531 --> 00:37:16,490
GUARD: Let's go. Work.

552
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:30,379
RED: And that's how it came to pass...
that on the second-to-last day of the job,

553
00:37:30,464 --> 00:37:35,134
the convict crew that tarred the plate-factory roof
in the spring of '49...

554
00:37:35,218 --> 00:37:38,429
wound up sitting in a row
at ten o'clock in the morning,

555
00:37:38,513 --> 00:37:42,391
drinking icy-cold, Bohemia-style beer...

556
00:37:42,476 --> 00:37:47,688
courtesy of the hardest screw that ever
walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.

557
00:37:47,773 --> 00:37:49,857
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

558
00:37:51,234 --> 00:37:55,404
The colossal prick
even managed to sound magnanimous.

559
00:37:57,157 --> 00:38:01,786
We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders,
and felt like free men.

560
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:05,372
Hell, we could have been tarring the roof
of one of our own houses.

561
00:38:05,457 --> 00:38:08,751
We were the lords of all creation.

562
00:38:08,835 --> 00:38:13,380
As for Andy,
he spent that break hunkered in the shade...

563
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:16,175
a strange little smile on his face,

564
00:38:16,259 --> 00:38:18,344
watching us drink his beer.

565
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:26,644
Hey...

566
00:38:26,728 --> 00:38:28,020
Want a cold one, Andy?

567
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:29,772
No, thanks.

568
00:38:29,856 --> 00:38:31,649
I gave up drinking.

569
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:38,656
RED: You could argue
he'd done it to curry favor with the guards.

570
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,575
Or maybe make a few friends among us cons.

571
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:47,289
Me, I think he did it just to feel normal again.

572
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:50,459
If only for a short while.

573
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:55,673
RED: King me.

574
00:38:55,757 --> 00:38:58,175
Chess. Now, there's a game of kings.

575
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,803
- What?
- Civilized, strategic.

576
00:39:00,887 --> 00:39:03,222
And a total fucking mystery.

577
00:39:03,306 --> 00:39:04,515
I hate it.

578
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:06,517
Maybe you'll let me teach you someday.

579
00:39:06,601 --> 00:39:09,061
(Chuckles) Yeah. Sure.

580
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:11,272
I thought of getting a board together.

581
00:39:11,356 --> 00:39:14,150
Well, I'm the right man.
I'm the guy that can get things.

582
00:39:14,234 --> 00:39:15,734
We might do business on a board.

583
00:39:15,819 --> 00:39:18,612
But I want to carve the pieces myself.

584
00:39:18,697 --> 00:39:22,283
One side in alabaster, the opposing side
in soapstone. What do you think?

585
00:39:22,367 --> 00:39:24,285
I think it'll take years.

586
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:26,954
Well, years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

587
00:39:27,038 --> 00:39:29,206
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

588
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:31,250
Pebbles, mostly.

589
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:38,465
Andy, we're getting to be kinda friends,
aren't we?

590
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,217
Yeah, I guess.

591
00:39:41,344 --> 00:39:43,762
Can I ask you something?

592
00:39:43,847 --> 00:39:45,848
Why did you do it?

593
00:39:47,058 --> 00:39:50,936
I'm innocent, Red. Just like everybody else here.

594
00:39:55,233 --> 00:39:57,318
What are you in for?

595
00:39:59,321 --> 00:40:00,321
Murder.

596
00:40:00,405 --> 00:40:01,822
Same as you.

597
00:40:01,907 --> 00:40:03,073
Innocent?

598
00:40:05,744 --> 00:40:07,828
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

599
00:41:07,305 --> 00:41:08,889
Where's the canary?

600
00:41:08,974 --> 00:41:10,307
How did you know?

601
00:41:10,308 --> 00:41:11,475
How did I know what?

602
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:13,978
So, you don't know? Come.

603
00:41:16,731 --> 00:41:18,857
This is where the canary is, Johnny.

604
00:41:18,942 --> 00:41:21,151
(Woman singing)

605
00:41:21,236 --> 00:41:25,239
Quite a surprise to hear a woman singing
in my house, eh, Johnny?

606
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:30,536
That's quite a...

607
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,288
surprise.

608
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:36,500
Red...

609
00:41:36,584 --> 00:41:38,377
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

610
00:41:38,461 --> 00:41:40,296
Here she comes.

611
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,257
This is the part I like -
when she does that shit with her hair.

612
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:46,260
Yeah, I know. I've seen it three times this month.

613
00:41:46,344 --> 00:41:48,345
Gilda, are you decent?

614
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:50,472
Me?

615
00:41:50,557 --> 00:41:52,099
(Men howl)

616
00:41:52,183 --> 00:41:54,226
Hah! God, I love it!

617
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,395
(Men cheer and whistle)

618
00:42:00,108 --> 00:42:03,902
I understand
you're a man that knows how to get things.

619
00:42:03,987 --> 00:42:07,865
Yeah, I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

620
00:42:07,949 --> 00:42:10,451
- Rita Hayworth.
- What?

621
00:42:10,535 --> 00:42:12,369
Can you get her?

622
00:42:13,455 --> 00:42:16,915
So, this is Johnny Farrell.
I've heard a lot about you, Johnny.

623
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,876
Take a few weeks.

624
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,169
Weeks?

625
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:25,424
Well, yeah, Andy. I don't have her stuffed down
the front of my pants right now, I'm sorry to say.

626
00:42:25,508 --> 00:42:28,010
But I'll get her. Relax.

627
00:42:30,263 --> 00:42:31,764
Thanks.

628
00:42:31,848 --> 00:42:33,849
- It was a surprise, Mr. Farrell.
- It was.

629
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:34,975
MEN: Sit down.

630
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,977
Did you tell him what I'm doing here?

631
00:42:37,062 --> 00:42:39,897
No, I wanted to save that as a surprise, too.

632
00:42:39,981 --> 00:42:41,648
Hang on to your hat, Mr. Farrell...

633
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,904
(Grunts)

634
00:42:51,743 --> 00:42:53,994
- Take a walk.
- I gotta change the reel.

635
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,163
I said fuck off!

636
00:42:58,458 --> 00:43:00,918
(Door closes as film dialogue continues)

637
00:43:01,002 --> 00:43:03,796
Ain't you gonna scream?

638
00:43:05,173 --> 00:43:06,965
Let's get this over with.

639
00:43:11,096 --> 00:43:12,721
He broke my fuckin' nose!

640
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:27,277
Now...I'm gonna open my fly...

641
00:43:27,362 --> 00:43:30,322
and you're gonna swallow
what I give you to swallow.

642
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:33,200
Then you're gonna swallow Rooster's.

643
00:43:33,284 --> 00:43:36,120
You broke his nose,
he ought to have something to show for it.

644
00:43:36,204 --> 00:43:38,414
Anything you put in my mouth,
you're gonna lose.

645
00:43:38,498 --> 00:43:41,250
No. You don't understand.

646
00:43:41,334 --> 00:43:44,628
You do that, and I'll put
all eight inches of this steel in your ear.

647
00:43:44,629 --> 00:43:45,712
All right.

648
00:43:45,797 --> 00:43:50,426
But you should know that sudden, serious
brain injury causes the victim to bite down hard.

649
00:43:51,678 --> 00:43:54,096
In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong,

650
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:58,976
they have to pry the victim's jaws open...
with a crowbar.

651
00:44:01,813 --> 00:44:03,439
Where did you get this shit?

652
00:44:03,523 --> 00:44:05,190
I read it.

653
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:09,153
Know how to read, you ignorant fuck?

654
00:44:10,655 --> 00:44:12,531
Honey...

655
00:44:13,783 --> 00:44:16,160
..you shouldn't.

656
00:44:16,244 --> 00:44:18,120
(Groans)

657
00:44:18,204 --> 00:44:21,206
RED: Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth...

658
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,667
and neither did his friends.

659
00:44:23,751 --> 00:44:27,045
What they did do...
is beat him within an inch of his life.

660
00:44:28,256 --> 00:44:30,257
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

661
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:33,802
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

662
00:44:38,266 --> 00:44:39,892
Time's up, Bogs.

663
00:44:43,563 --> 00:44:45,647
It's your world, boss.

664
00:44:47,734 --> 00:44:51,153
TANNOY:
Return to your cell blocks for evening count.

665
00:44:51,237 --> 00:44:53,405
All prisoners report for lockdown.

666
00:45:08,963 --> 00:45:10,255
What?

667
00:45:12,926 --> 00:45:14,676
(Gasps)

668
00:45:16,888 --> 00:45:18,972
(Bogs cries in pain)

669
00:45:22,727 --> 00:45:25,437
GUARD: Where's he going?
HADLEY: Grab his ankles.

670
00:45:27,023 --> 00:45:29,525
No! No!

671
00:45:29,609 --> 00:45:30,984
No!

672
00:45:31,069 --> 00:45:32,402
Help me...

673
00:45:32,487 --> 00:45:33,779
Aaarghh!

674
00:45:33,863 --> 00:45:35,989
(Punching and screaming)

675
00:45:36,074 --> 00:45:38,742
RED:
Two things never happened again after that.

676
00:45:38,826 --> 00:45:41,662
The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again...

677
00:45:42,872 --> 00:45:45,582
..and Bogs never walked again.

678
00:45:46,709 --> 00:45:50,128
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

679
00:45:50,213 --> 00:45:55,926
To my knowledge, he lived out the rest
of his days drinking his food through a straw.

680
00:45:56,010 --> 00:46:00,681
I'm thinking Andy could use a nice welcome
back when he gets out of the infirmary.

681
00:46:01,808 --> 00:46:05,602
Sounds good to us.
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.

682
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:09,648
The man likes to play chess.

683
00:46:09,732 --> 00:46:11,817
Let's get him some rocks.

684
00:46:44,225 --> 00:46:46,101
Guys...

685
00:46:46,185 --> 00:46:48,562
I got one. I got one. Look.

686
00:46:50,982 --> 00:46:53,066
Heywood, that isn't soapstone.

687
00:46:53,151 --> 00:46:55,360
And it ain't alabaster, either.

688
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:57,070
What are you, a fucking geologist?

689
00:46:57,155 --> 00:46:59,197
He's right. It ain't.

690
00:46:59,282 --> 00:47:00,532
Well, what the hell is it?

691
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:03,160
RED: A horse apple.

692
00:47:03,244 --> 00:47:06,371
- Bullshit.
- No, horse shit. Petrified.

693
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:08,540
(Horse whinnies)

694
00:47:12,754 --> 00:47:15,631
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
(Men laugh)

695
00:47:15,715 --> 00:47:17,674
Oh, damn!

696
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:21,720
RED: Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

697
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:25,557
And by the weekend he was due back,
we had enough rocks

698
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:28,685
to keep him busy till rapture.

699
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:31,480
I also got a big shipment in that week.

700
00:47:31,564 --> 00:47:34,107
Cigarettes. Chewing gum.

701
00:47:34,192 --> 00:47:35,692
Sipping whisky.

702
00:47:35,777 --> 00:47:39,321
Playing cards with naked ladies on them.
You name it.

703
00:47:39,405 --> 00:47:42,366
And of course, the most important item.

704
00:47:44,118 --> 00:47:46,203
Rita Hayworth herself.

705
00:48:20,363 --> 00:48:23,198
GUARD: OK, look alive! Open all tiers.

706
00:48:23,282 --> 00:48:25,617
(Furtively) Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

707
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:27,953
Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

708
00:48:30,081 --> 00:48:31,957
119.

709
00:48:33,459 --> 00:48:35,127
123.

710
00:48:36,212 --> 00:48:38,296
(Guards calling out)

711
00:48:44,595 --> 00:48:46,471
On your feet.

712
00:48:48,182 --> 00:48:50,058
Face the wall.

713
00:49:24,552 --> 00:49:26,636
HADLEY: Turn around and face the Warden.

714
00:49:32,351 --> 00:49:34,436
Pleased to see you reading this.

715
00:49:35,813 --> 00:49:38,106
Any favorite passages?

716
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:44,279
"Watch ye, therefore, for ye know not
when the master of the house cometh."

717
00:49:45,323 --> 00:49:48,200
Mark 13:35.

718
00:49:48,284 --> 00:49:50,952
I always liked that one.

719
00:49:51,037 --> 00:49:52,537
But I prefer...

720
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:55,373
"I'm the light of the world.

721
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:59,002
He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness,
but shall have the light of life."

722
00:49:59,086 --> 00:50:01,671
John, Chapter 8, Verse 12.

723
00:50:01,756 --> 00:50:05,217
I hear you're good with numbers. How nice.

724
00:50:06,344 --> 00:50:08,428
A man should have a skill.

725
00:50:10,515 --> 00:50:11,973
Wanna explain this?

726
00:50:13,059 --> 00:50:16,520
It's called a rock blanket.
It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

727
00:50:17,563 --> 00:50:19,523
A little hobby of mine.

728
00:50:27,949 --> 00:50:30,283
(Inhales)

729
00:50:30,368 --> 00:50:33,370
It's pretty clean. Some contraband here,

730
00:50:33,454 --> 00:50:35,539
but nothing to get in a twist over.

731
00:50:39,377 --> 00:50:41,461
I can't say I approve of this.

732
00:50:42,964 --> 00:50:44,673
But I suppose...

733
00:50:46,634 --> 00:50:48,510
..exceptions can be made.

734
00:50:58,896 --> 00:51:01,189
HADLEY: Lock 'em up!

735
00:51:03,192 --> 00:51:05,151
I almost forgot.

736
00:51:05,236 --> 00:51:07,487
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

737
00:51:07,572 --> 00:51:09,030
Salvation lies within.

738
00:51:10,116 --> 00:51:11,449
Yes, sir.

739
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:22,335
RED: Tossing cells was just an excuse.

740
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:26,464
The truth is, Norton wanted to size Andy up.

741
00:51:40,104 --> 00:51:43,231
My wife made that in church group.

742
00:51:45,568 --> 00:51:46,902
Very nice, sir.

743
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:49,946
Do you enjoy working in the laundry?

744
00:51:51,574 --> 00:51:53,283
No, sir, not especially.

745
00:51:53,367 --> 00:51:56,161
Perhaps we can find something more...

746
00:51:56,245 --> 00:51:58,330
befitting a man of your education.

747
00:52:02,668 --> 00:52:04,544
(Bird screeches)

748
00:52:06,672 --> 00:52:08,340
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?

749
00:52:08,424 --> 00:52:09,716
Andy.

750
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,093
I thought I heard you out here!

751
00:52:13,596 --> 00:52:15,180
I've been reassigned to you.

752
00:52:15,264 --> 00:52:18,433
I know. They told me. (Chuckles)

753
00:52:18,517 --> 00:52:20,602
Ain't that a kick in the head?

754
00:52:20,686 --> 00:52:23,188
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

755
00:52:23,272 --> 00:52:25,357
Come on.

756
00:52:25,441 --> 00:52:27,609
Well, here she is.

757
00:52:27,693 --> 00:52:30,236
Shawshank Prison library.

758
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:33,198
National Geographics.

759
00:52:33,282 --> 00:52:36,117
Reader's Digest condensed books.

760
00:52:36,202 --> 00:52:38,495
Louis L'Amour.

761
00:52:38,496 --> 00:52:40,622
Look Magazine.

762
00:52:40,706 --> 00:52:43,208
Erle Stanley Gardners.

763
00:52:43,292 --> 00:52:46,836
Every evening,
I load up the cart and make my round.

764
00:52:46,837 --> 00:52:50,006
I enter the names on this clipboard here.

765
00:52:50,091 --> 00:52:53,551
Easy-peasy, Japanesey. Any questions?

766
00:52:53,636 --> 00:52:56,596
Brooks, how long have you been librarian?

767
00:52:56,681 --> 00:53:01,851
Oh...I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

768
00:53:01,936 --> 00:53:05,313
And in all that time,
have you ever had an assistant?

769
00:53:05,398 --> 00:53:07,983
No. No, not much to it, really.

770
00:53:08,067 --> 00:53:09,985
Well, why me? Why now?

771
00:53:10,069 --> 00:53:11,569
I don't know,

772
00:53:11,654 --> 00:53:14,990
but it'll be nice to have some company
down here for a change.

773
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:17,075
HADLEY: Dufresne!

774
00:53:26,377 --> 00:53:28,461
That's him. That's the one.

775
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:37,303
I'm Dekins.

776
00:53:37,388 --> 00:53:39,848
(Nervously) I was er...

777
00:53:39,932 --> 00:53:43,935
thinking about maybe setting up
some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.

778
00:53:46,272 --> 00:53:47,731
Oh...

779
00:53:47,815 --> 00:53:49,482
I see.

780
00:53:50,943 --> 00:53:52,819
Well, erm...

781
00:53:54,196 --> 00:53:55,739
..why don't we have a seat,

782
00:53:55,823 --> 00:53:57,907
and talk it over?

783
00:54:00,453 --> 00:54:03,371
Brooks,
do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?

784
00:54:14,842 --> 00:54:16,551
Thanks.

785
00:54:16,635 --> 00:54:18,303
So...

786
00:54:19,555 --> 00:54:22,057
Mr. Dekins...

787
00:54:22,141 --> 00:54:26,603
And then Andy says to Mr. Dekins,
"Do you want your sons to go to Harvard,

788
00:54:26,687 --> 00:54:28,813
- or Yale?"
- He didn't say that?

789
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:31,566
As God is my witness, he did!

790
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:35,028
Dekins just blinked for a second.
Then he laughed himself silly.

791
00:54:35,112 --> 00:54:36,988
And afterwards he shook Andy's hand.

792
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:38,448
My ass!

793
00:54:38,532 --> 00:54:39,741
Shook his hand.

794
00:54:39,825 --> 00:54:42,786
Hell, I...I near soiled myself! (Laughs)

795
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:47,082
All Andy needed was a suit and a tie
and a little jiggly hula girl on his desk,

796
00:54:47,166 --> 00:54:48,500
and he would have been:

797
00:54:48,584 --> 00:54:50,126
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please"!

798
00:54:50,211 --> 00:54:51,961
Making a few friends, Andy?

799
00:54:53,005 --> 00:54:54,964
I wouldn't say "friends".

800
00:54:55,049 --> 00:54:59,052
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

801
00:54:59,136 --> 00:55:01,471
It's a wonderful pet to have.

802
00:55:01,555 --> 00:55:03,473
Got you out of the laundry, though.

803
00:55:03,557 --> 00:55:05,767
Well, it might do more than that.

804
00:55:05,851 --> 00:55:08,853
How about expanding the library?
Get some new books in there.

805
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:11,648
If you're gonna ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

806
00:55:11,732 --> 00:55:14,192
- Right.
- How do you expect to do that?

807
00:55:14,276 --> 00:55:19,531
I mean, get new books in here,
Mr. Dufresne, if you please?

808
00:55:19,615 --> 00:55:21,366
Ask the Warden for funds.

809
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:22,700
(Laughter)

810
00:55:22,785 --> 00:55:26,079
Son, son. Six wardens
have been through here in my tenure,

811
00:55:26,163 --> 00:55:29,791
and I've learned one immutable, universal truth.

812
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:31,584
Not one of them born...

813
00:55:31,585 --> 00:55:36,548
whose asshole wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you asked them for funds.

814
00:55:36,632 --> 00:55:38,925
The budget's stretched thin, as it is.

815
00:55:39,009 --> 00:55:40,260
I see.

816
00:55:40,344 --> 00:55:43,888
Perhaps I could write to the State Senate
and request funds from them.

817
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:48,351
As far as they're concerned, there's only three
ways to spend money when it comes to prisons:

818
00:55:48,435 --> 00:55:50,520
more walls, more bars and more guards.

819
00:55:50,604 --> 00:55:55,024
Still, I'd like to try, with your permission.
A letter a week. They can't ignore me forever.

820
00:55:55,109 --> 00:55:56,651
Sure can.

821
00:55:56,735 --> 00:55:59,612
But you write your letters, if it makes you happy.

822
00:55:59,697 --> 00:56:01,990
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

823
00:56:03,909 --> 00:56:06,953
RED: So, Andy started writing a letter a week,

824
00:56:07,037 --> 00:56:09,122
just like he said.

825
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:17,297
And, just like Norton said, Andy got no answers.

826
00:56:25,139 --> 00:56:30,643
The following April, Andy did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

827
00:56:30,728 --> 00:56:33,813
The year after that, he did them all...

828
00:56:33,898 --> 00:56:35,982
including the Warden's.

829
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:41,112
The year after that, they rescheduled
the start of the intramural season

830
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:43,281
to coincide with tax season.

831
00:56:45,576 --> 00:56:49,787
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

832
00:56:49,872 --> 00:56:54,000
So, Moresby Prison issued you your gun,
but you had to pay for it?

833
00:56:54,084 --> 00:56:55,835
Damn right. The holster, too.

834
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,170
That's tax-deductible.

835
00:56:57,254 --> 00:56:58,421
You can write that off.

836
00:56:58,505 --> 00:57:01,841
RED: Yes, sir.
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

837
00:57:01,926 --> 00:57:04,969
In fact, it got so busy at tax time...

838
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:07,096
he was allowed a staff.

839
00:57:07,181 --> 00:57:09,641
Hey, Red, can you hand me a stack of 1040s?

840
00:57:09,725 --> 00:57:12,393
It got me out of the wood shop
a month out of the year,

841
00:57:12,478 --> 00:57:15,146
and that was fine by me.

842
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:18,608
And still...he kept sending those letters.

843
00:57:23,906 --> 00:57:25,740
Red, Andy.

844
00:57:25,824 --> 00:57:27,033
It's Brooks.

845
00:57:27,117 --> 00:57:29,577
(Men shouting)
- Watch the door.

846
00:57:29,662 --> 00:57:31,246
Please, Brooks.

847
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:33,331
- Just calm the fuck down.
- Stay back!

848
00:57:33,415 --> 00:57:35,458
- Stay back!
- What the hell's going on?

849
00:57:35,542 --> 00:57:38,628
You tell me. One second he's fine.
Then out comes the knife.

850
00:57:38,712 --> 00:57:41,172
Brooks, we can talk about this. Right?

851
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:43,383
Nothing to talk about, goddamn it!

852
00:57:43,467 --> 00:57:45,176
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.

853
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:47,136
Heywood? Wait, what's he done to you?

854
00:57:47,221 --> 00:57:49,347
It's what they done!

855
00:57:49,431 --> 00:57:50,848
I...I got no choice...

856
00:57:50,933 --> 00:57:53,601
You're not gonna hurt him.
Even Heywood knows that.

857
00:57:53,686 --> 00:57:56,312
- Right, Heywood?
- I...I know that, sure.

858
00:57:56,397 --> 00:57:59,816
You won't hurt him, because he's a friend,
and you're a reasonable man.

859
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,192
That's right. Right, guys?

860
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:04,654
- Yes.
- So, put the knife down. Brooks, look at me.

861
00:58:04,738 --> 00:58:06,572
Put the knife down.

862
00:58:07,658 --> 00:58:08,825
Brooks...

863
00:58:08,909 --> 00:58:11,160
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

864
00:58:11,245 --> 00:58:13,579
Brooks, look at his neck. It's bleeding.

865
00:58:13,664 --> 00:58:14,831
(Heywood gasps)

866
00:58:14,915 --> 00:58:16,499
It's the only...

867
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:18,876
It's the only way they'd let me stay.

868
00:58:18,961 --> 00:58:21,546
Come on. This is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

869
00:58:21,547 --> 00:58:23,631
Put it down.

870
00:58:24,967 --> 00:58:27,343
(Brooks sobs)

871
00:58:31,015 --> 00:58:35,727
Come on. Take it easy.
You're going to be all right.

872
00:58:35,811 --> 00:58:37,186
HEYWOOD: Him?

873
00:58:37,271 --> 00:58:40,940
Hell, what about me?
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat.

874
00:58:41,025 --> 00:58:43,651
RED: Shit, Heywood,
you've had worse from shaving.

875
00:58:43,736 --> 00:58:45,987
What the hell did you do to set him off, anyway?

876
00:58:46,071 --> 00:58:48,406
Nothing. I come in here to say fare-thee-well.

877
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:51,617
Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.

878
00:58:53,662 --> 00:58:56,789
I just don't understand what happened in there.
That's all.

879
00:58:56,874 --> 00:58:59,459
The old man's as crazy
as a rat in a tin shithouse.

880
00:58:59,543 --> 00:59:01,753
Oh, Heywood, that's enough out of you.

881
00:59:01,837 --> 00:59:04,839
- I heard he had you shitting in your pants.
- Fuck you!

882
00:59:04,923 --> 00:59:06,299
Would you knock it off?

883
00:59:06,383 --> 00:59:08,718
Brooks ain't no bug.

884
00:59:08,802 --> 00:59:10,678
He's just...

885
00:59:12,556 --> 00:59:14,390
He's just institutionalized.

886
00:59:15,726 --> 00:59:17,393
Institutionalized, my ass.

887
00:59:17,478 --> 00:59:21,773
The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood.
50 years.

888
00:59:21,857 --> 00:59:23,566
This is all he knows.

889
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:26,069
In here, he's an important man.

890
00:59:26,153 --> 00:59:27,612
He's an educated man.

891
00:59:27,696 --> 00:59:29,781
Outside, he's nothing.

892
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:34,577
Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.

893
00:59:34,661 --> 00:59:37,872
Probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.

894
00:59:37,956 --> 00:59:40,041
You know what I'm trying to say?

895
00:59:40,125 --> 00:59:42,877
Red, I do believe you're talking out of your ass.

896
00:59:44,129 --> 00:59:47,048
You believe whatever you want, Floyd.

897
00:59:47,049 --> 00:59:49,592
But I'm telling you, these walls are funny.

898
00:59:51,011 --> 00:59:53,096
First you hate 'em...

899
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,724
..then you get used to 'em.

900
00:59:58,352 --> 01:00:00,978
Enough time passes...

901
01:00:01,063 --> 01:00:04,023
you get so you depend on 'em.

902
01:00:04,108 --> 01:00:06,442
That's institutionalized.

903
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,902
JIGGER: Shit.

904
01:00:07,903 --> 01:00:09,529
You can never get like that.

905
01:00:09,613 --> 01:00:11,531
Oh, yeah?

906
01:00:11,615 --> 01:00:14,200
Say that when you've been here
as long as Brooks has.

907
01:00:14,284 --> 01:00:16,160
Goddamn right.

908
01:00:18,497 --> 01:00:21,040
They send you here for life.

909
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:23,209
That's exactly what they take.

910
01:00:25,129 --> 01:00:27,213
The part that counts, anyway.

911
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:33,594
(Jake screeches)

912
01:00:34,721 --> 01:00:36,889
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

913
01:00:38,809 --> 01:00:40,643
You go on, now.

914
01:00:41,728 --> 01:00:46,399
You're free.

915
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:04,167
Bye.

916
01:01:05,252 --> 01:01:07,170
Good luck, Brooks.

917
01:01:43,749 --> 01:01:46,459
BROOKS: Dear fellas...

918
01:01:46,543 --> 01:01:50,755
I can't believe
how fast things move on the outside.

919
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:52,089
(Horn blares)

920
01:01:52,174 --> 01:01:55,218
Watch it, old-timer! Are you trying to get killed?

921
01:01:55,302 --> 01:01:58,638
I saw an automobile once, when I was a kid,

922
01:01:58,722 --> 01:02:01,641
but now...they're everywhere.

923
01:02:05,854 --> 01:02:09,440
The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

924
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:32,088
The parole board got me into
this halfway house called The Brewer,

925
01:02:32,172 --> 01:02:35,967
and a job bagging groceries at the Foodway.

926
01:02:38,011 --> 01:02:43,349
It's hard work, and I try to keep up,
but my hands hurt most of the time.

927
01:02:43,433 --> 01:02:45,434
WOMAN: Make sure your man double-bags.

928
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:47,770
Last time, the bottom near came out.

929
01:02:47,854 --> 01:02:51,148
Make sure you double-bag, like the lady says.
Understand?

930
01:02:51,233 --> 01:02:52,692
Yes, sir. I surely will.

931
01:02:52,776 --> 01:02:56,571
BROOKS: I don't think
the store manager likes me very much.

932
01:02:56,655 --> 01:02:58,447
(Pigeons cooing)

933
01:02:59,533 --> 01:03:04,328
Sometimes, after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

934
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:09,750
I keep thinking Jake might just show up
and say hello.

935
01:03:09,835 --> 01:03:11,627
But he never does.

936
01:03:12,713 --> 01:03:18,092
And I hope, wherever he is,
he's doing OK and making new friends.

937
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:24,515
I have trouble sleeping at night.

938
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,393
I have bad dreams, like I'm falling.

939
01:03:28,478 --> 01:03:30,396
I wake up, scared.

940
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,483
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

941
01:03:36,111 --> 01:03:37,570
Maybe I should get me a gun

942
01:03:37,654 --> 01:03:41,532
and rob the Foodway, so they'd send me home.

943
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:43,951
I could shoot the manager, while I was at it.

944
01:03:44,036 --> 01:03:45,995
Sort of like a bonus.

945
01:03:47,497 --> 01:03:51,751
I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense
any more.

946
01:03:51,835 --> 01:03:53,878
I don't like it here.

947
01:03:53,962 --> 01:03:56,631
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.

948
01:03:56,715 --> 01:03:57,798
I've decided...

949
01:03:57,883 --> 01:03:59,759
not to stay.

950
01:04:11,104 --> 01:04:14,607
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.

951
01:04:14,691 --> 01:04:16,776
Not for an old crook like me.

952
01:04:31,625 --> 01:04:33,542
(Scraping)

953
01:05:19,798 --> 01:05:23,843
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.
Not for an old crook like me.

954
01:05:25,011 --> 01:05:29,056
PS. Tell Heywood
I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat.

955
01:05:29,057 --> 01:05:31,142
No hard feelings. Brooks."

956
01:05:41,862 --> 01:05:43,946
He should have died in here.

957
01:05:49,369 --> 01:05:53,831
HADLEY: What the fuck have you done?
It's a goddamn mess. I'll tell you that.

958
01:05:58,545 --> 01:05:59,962
What's all this?

959
01:06:00,046 --> 01:06:03,924
You tell me, fuck-stick.
They're all addressed to you.

960
01:06:04,009 --> 01:06:05,301
Take it.

961
01:06:14,269 --> 01:06:15,853
"Dear Mr. Dufresne...

962
01:06:16,938 --> 01:06:18,939
In response to your repeated enquiries,

963
01:06:19,024 --> 01:06:23,736
the State has allocated the enclosed funds
for your library project."

964
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:25,196
This is 200 dollars.

965
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:30,159
"In addition, the Library District
has generously responded

966
01:06:30,243 --> 01:06:32,953
with a charitable donation
of used books and sundries.

967
01:06:33,038 --> 01:06:35,122
We trust this will fill your needs.

968
01:06:35,207 --> 01:06:39,335
We now consider the matter closed.
Please stop sending us letters."

969
01:06:39,419 --> 01:06:42,254
I want all this cleared out
before the Warden gets back.

970
01:06:42,339 --> 01:06:44,006
Yes, sir.

971
01:06:47,761 --> 01:06:49,136
Good for you, Andy.

972
01:06:51,765 --> 01:06:53,224
Wow!

973
01:06:54,309 --> 01:06:56,393
It only took six years.

974
01:06:57,687 --> 01:07:00,564
From now on,
I'll write two letters a week, instead of one.

975
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:04,193
Oh, I believe you're crazy enough.
You'd better get all this stuff out,

976
01:07:04,277 --> 01:07:05,444
like the Captain said.

977
01:07:05,529 --> 01:07:09,406
Now, I'm gonna go pinch a loaf.
When I come back, this is all gone, right?

978
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:17,581
Wow.

979
01:07:47,654 --> 01:07:50,364
â™ª MOZART:
Duettino from The Marriage Of Figaro

01:07:51,825 --> 01:07:54,410
â™ª Sull'aria...

981
01:07:58,039 --> 01:07:59,039
Andy,

982
01:07:59,124 --> 01:08:00,457
do you hear that?

983
01:08:00,542 --> 01:08:04,253
â™ª ..zeffiretto

â™ª Questa sera spirera

986
01:08:33,033 --> 01:08:34,366
(Feedback hisses)

987
01:08:36,578 --> 01:08:39,496
(Music over loudspeakers)

988
01:08:43,501 --> 01:08:45,586
(Aria continues)

01:08:54,721 --> 01:08:59,016
â™ª Sotto i pini

â™ª Sotto i pini...

992
01:09:08,276 --> 01:09:11,153
(Banging at door) Dufresne?

993
01:09:11,237 --> 01:09:12,821
Dufresne?

994
01:09:12,906 --> 01:09:14,990
Andy, let me out.

995
01:09:17,702 --> 01:09:21,246
Andy?

996
01:09:21,331 --> 01:09:26,502
RED: I have no idea to this day
what those two Italian ladies were singing about.

997
01:09:26,586 --> 01:09:29,004
The truth is, I don't want to know.

998
01:09:29,089 --> 01:09:31,173
Some things are best left unsaid.

999
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:40,265
I like to think they were singing about something
so beautiful, it can't be expressed in words...

1000
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:42,726
and makes your heart ache because of it.

1001
01:09:44,938 --> 01:09:47,648
I tell you, those voices soared...

1002
01:09:47,732 --> 01:09:52,277
higher and farther
than anybody in a grey place dares to dream.

1003
01:09:52,362 --> 01:09:55,739
It was like some beautiful bird
flapped into our drab little cage

1004
01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:58,951
and made those walls dissolve away.

1005
01:09:59,035 --> 01:10:01,370
And for the briefest of moments...

1006
01:10:01,454 --> 01:10:04,540
every last man at Shawshank felt free.

1007
01:10:07,043 --> 01:10:09,545
It pissed the Warden off something awful.

1008
01:10:10,964 --> 01:10:12,089
Open the door.

1009
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:16,760
Open it up!

1010
01:10:17,971 --> 01:10:20,347
Dufresne, open this door!

1011
01:10:20,432 --> 01:10:21,890
(Bangs door)

1012
01:10:21,975 --> 01:10:23,308
Turn that off!

1013
01:10:23,393 --> 01:10:25,477
(Bangs door)

1014
01:10:27,147 --> 01:10:30,024
(Aria continues)

1015
01:10:30,108 --> 01:10:32,860
I am warning you, Dufresne. Turn that off!

1016
01:10:36,364 --> 01:10:38,449
(Increases volume)

1017
01:10:46,708 --> 01:10:48,584
Dufresne...

1018
01:10:49,711 --> 01:10:51,795
You're mine now.

1019
01:10:59,345 --> 01:11:02,097
RED: Andy got two weeks in the hole
for that little stunt.

1020
01:11:02,182 --> 01:11:04,600
(Hadley stops record) On your feet!

1021
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:07,895
- Hey, look who's here.
- Maestro!

1022
01:11:09,397 --> 01:11:13,442
Y-Y-You couldn't play something good, huh?
Hank Williams or something?

1023
01:11:13,526 --> 01:11:16,195
They broke the door down
before I could take requests.

1024
01:11:16,279 --> 01:11:18,072
Was it worth it, two weeks in the hole?

1025
01:11:18,156 --> 01:11:19,406
Easiest time I ever did.

1026
01:11:19,491 --> 01:11:22,534
Bullshit!
There's no such thing as easy time in the hole.

1027
01:11:22,535 --> 01:11:25,162
A week in the hole is like a year.

1028
01:11:25,246 --> 01:11:27,956
I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

1029
01:11:28,041 --> 01:11:31,376
So, they let you tote that record player
down there, huh?

1030
01:11:33,505 --> 01:11:35,130
It was in here.

1031
01:11:35,215 --> 01:11:36,882
And in here.

1032
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:42,346
That's the beauty of music.
They can't get that from you.

1033
01:11:46,267 --> 01:11:48,769
Haven't you ever felt that way about music?

1034
01:11:50,438 --> 01:11:54,525
Well, I played a mean harmonica,
as a younger man.

1035
01:11:54,609 --> 01:11:56,401
Lost interest in it, though.

1036
01:11:56,486 --> 01:11:58,320
Didn't make much sense in here.

1037
01:11:58,404 --> 01:12:00,864
Here's where it makes the most sense.

1038
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:03,534
You need it, so you don't forget.

1039
01:12:03,618 --> 01:12:04,952
Forget?

1040
01:12:05,036 --> 01:12:06,995
Forget that...

1041
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,164
there are places...

1042
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,043
..in the world that aren't made out of stone...

1043
01:12:13,128 --> 01:12:15,170
that there's a...

1044
01:12:15,255 --> 01:12:17,089
there's something...

1045
01:12:17,173 --> 01:12:19,967
inside that they can't get to...

1046
01:12:20,051 --> 01:12:22,344
that they can't touch.

1047
01:12:22,428 --> 01:12:24,304
It's yours.

1048
01:12:25,723 --> 01:12:27,432
What are you talking about?

1049
01:12:28,518 --> 01:12:30,102
Hope.

1050
01:12:30,186 --> 01:12:32,062
Hope?

1051
01:12:33,898 --> 01:12:36,567
Let me tell you something, my friend.

1052
01:12:36,651 --> 01:12:38,610
Hope is a dangerous thing.

1053
01:12:40,196 --> 01:12:42,239
Hope can drive a man insane.

1054
01:12:43,283 --> 01:12:45,200
It's got no use on the inside.

1055
01:12:45,285 --> 01:12:47,953
You'd better get used to that idea.

1056
01:12:50,373 --> 01:12:51,999
Like Brooks did?

1057
01:13:17,233 --> 01:13:18,275
Sit down.

1058
01:13:23,489 --> 01:13:26,950
It says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

1059
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:29,661
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1060
01:13:29,746 --> 01:13:31,830
Oh, yes, sir.

1061
01:13:31,831 --> 01:13:33,916
Without a doubt.

1062
01:13:34,959 --> 01:13:37,294
And I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

1063
01:13:39,881 --> 01:13:41,924
No danger to society here.

1064
01:13:42,008 --> 01:13:44,092
God's honest truth.

1065
01:13:46,429 --> 01:13:48,513
Absolutely rehabilitated.

1066
01:13:58,441 --> 01:14:00,525
30 years.

1067
01:14:01,611 --> 01:14:03,654
Jesus, when they say it like that...

1068
01:14:03,738 --> 01:14:05,822
You wonder where it went.

1069
01:14:08,785 --> 01:14:10,869
I wonder where ten years went.

1070
01:14:15,917 --> 01:14:17,209
Here.

1071
01:14:17,293 --> 01:14:19,461
Little parole rejection present.

1072
01:14:21,297 --> 01:14:23,340
Go ahead and open it.

1073
01:14:23,424 --> 01:14:27,219
I had to go through one of your competitors.
I hope you don't mind.

1074
01:14:27,303 --> 01:14:29,388
I wanted it to be a surprise.

1075
01:14:39,524 --> 01:14:41,608
It's very pretty, Andy.

1076
01:14:42,694 --> 01:14:44,778
Thank you.

1077
01:14:46,531 --> 01:14:48,615
Are you going to play it?

1078
01:14:52,745 --> 01:14:54,830
No.

1079
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:59,209
Not right now.

1080
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:06,383
(Guards shout)

1081
01:15:06,467 --> 01:15:08,552
Tier 3 South. Clear.

1082
01:15:09,595 --> 01:15:11,638
Tier 4 North. Clear.

1083
01:15:11,723 --> 01:15:13,807
Tier 1 South. Clear.

1084
01:15:16,644 --> 01:15:18,729
Fall in!

1085
01:15:21,441 --> 01:15:23,525
(Gate buzzer)

1086
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:53,221
(Guard's footsteps)

1087
01:15:53,306 --> 01:15:54,890
Lights out!

1088
01:15:54,974 --> 01:15:56,475
(Click of light switches)

1089
01:16:01,898 --> 01:16:03,982
(Guard walks away)

1090
01:16:10,156 --> 01:16:12,240
(Outer door closes)

1091
01:16:21,084 --> 01:16:23,168
(Gently plays one note)

1092
01:16:28,591 --> 01:16:29,716
(Hammering)

1093
01:16:29,801 --> 01:16:31,843
RED: Andy was as good as his word.

1094
01:16:31,928 --> 01:16:34,429
He wrote two letters a week instead of one.

1095
01:16:37,058 --> 01:16:41,186
In 1959, the State Senate
finally clued into the fact

1096
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:44,147
they couldn't buy him off
with just a $200 check.

1097
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:50,821
Appropriations Committee voted
an annual payment of $500 just to shut him up.

1098
01:16:50,905 --> 01:16:52,614
And you'd be amazed

1099
01:16:52,698 --> 01:16:54,366
how far Andy could stretch it.

1100
01:16:54,450 --> 01:16:57,327
He made deals with book clubs, charity groups.

1101
01:16:57,412 --> 01:16:59,788
He bought remaindered books by the pound.

1102
01:16:59,872 --> 01:17:02,082
Treasure Island.

1103
01:17:02,166 --> 01:17:04,334
Robert Louis...

1104
01:17:04,419 --> 01:17:05,627
..Stevenson.

1105
01:17:05,711 --> 01:17:07,170
Fiction, adventure.

1106
01:17:09,173 --> 01:17:10,799
What's next?

1107
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,510
I got here Auto Repair and...

1108
01:17:14,554 --> 01:17:15,887
..Soap Carving.

1109
01:17:15,972 --> 01:17:19,349
Trade skills and hobbies. Goes under
Educational. The stack behind you.

1110
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:21,476
The Count Of Monte Crisco.

1111
01:17:21,561 --> 01:17:23,895
That's Cristo, you dumb shit.

1112
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:27,774
By Alexandree...Dumass.

1113
01:17:27,859 --> 01:17:32,779
Dumb-ass?

1114
01:17:35,283 --> 01:17:37,617
Dumas. You know what that's about?

1115
01:17:37,702 --> 01:17:39,077
Uh-uh.

1116
01:17:39,162 --> 01:17:41,872
You'll like it. It's about a prison break.

1117
01:17:41,956 --> 01:17:45,959
We ought to file that under Educational, too,
oughtn't we?

1118
01:17:46,043 --> 01:17:50,213
RED: The rest of us did our best to pitch in
when and where we could.

1119
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:53,300
By the year Kennedy was shot,

1120
01:17:53,384 --> 01:17:57,721
Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of rat turds and turpentine

1121
01:17:57,722 --> 01:18:01,057
into the best prison library in New England,

1122
01:18:01,142 --> 01:18:05,020
complete with a fine selection of Hank Williams.

1123
01:18:05,104 --> 01:18:09,274
â™ª Lawd I don't know what I'll do-ooo

1124
01:18:09,358 --> 01:18:12,110
â™ª All I do is sit and sigh...

1125
01:18:12,195 --> 01:18:16,948
RED: That was also the year Warden Norton
instituted his famous Inside Out program.

1126
01:18:17,033 --> 01:18:19,743
You may remember reading about it.

1127
01:18:19,827 --> 01:18:23,246
It made all the papers
and got his picture in Look Magazine.

1128
01:18:23,331 --> 01:18:24,998
No free ride.

1129
01:18:25,082 --> 01:18:28,043
But rather a genuine, progressive advance

1130
01:18:28,127 --> 01:18:30,295
in corrections and rehabilitation.

1131
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:33,673
Our inmates, properly supervised,

1132
01:18:33,758 --> 01:18:36,510
will be put to work outside these walls,

1133
01:18:36,594 --> 01:18:38,678
performing all manner of public service.

1134
01:18:38,763 --> 01:18:42,682
These men can learn
the value of an honest day's labor,

1135
01:18:42,767 --> 01:18:46,436
while providing a valuable service
to the community and...

1136
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:51,733
at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q Taxpayer.

1137
01:18:51,817 --> 01:18:54,486
RED: Of course,
Norton failed to mention to the press

1138
01:18:54,570 --> 01:18:57,864
that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.

1139
01:18:57,949 --> 01:19:01,117
There are a hundred different ways
to skim off the top.

1140
01:19:01,202 --> 01:19:03,828
Men, materials, you name it.

1141
01:19:04,872 --> 01:19:07,624
And, oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in.

1142
01:19:07,708 --> 01:19:09,834
If this keeps up, you'll put me out of business.

1143
01:19:09,919 --> 01:19:12,087
- Ned!
- This pool of slave labor you've got,

1144
01:19:12,171 --> 01:19:14,214
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1145
01:19:14,298 --> 01:19:18,260
Ned, we're providing
a valuable community service here.

1146
01:19:18,344 --> 01:19:20,595
Well, that's fine for the papers

1147
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:22,180
but I've got a family to feed.

1148
01:19:22,265 --> 01:19:23,974
Sam...

1149
01:19:24,058 --> 01:19:26,518
Sam, we go back a long way.

1150
01:19:26,602 --> 01:19:28,937
I need this new highway contract.

1151
01:19:29,021 --> 01:19:31,231
I don't get it, and I go under.

1152
01:19:31,315 --> 01:19:33,358
That's a fact.

1153
01:19:33,442 --> 01:19:35,527
You just have some of this fine pie

1154
01:19:35,611 --> 01:19:37,654
my missus made especially for you,

1155
01:19:37,738 --> 01:19:39,072
and you think about that.

1156
01:19:47,123 --> 01:19:50,041
Ned, I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

1157
01:19:50,126 --> 01:19:53,336
It seems to me I already got
my boys committed elsewhere.

1158
01:19:55,214 --> 01:19:57,799
You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.

1159
01:19:59,427 --> 01:20:01,595
RED: And behind every shady deal,

1160
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:03,888
behind every dollar earned,

1161
01:20:03,973 --> 01:20:07,142
there was Andy, keeping the books.

1162
01:20:08,185 --> 01:20:11,605
Two deposits.
Maine National and New England First.

1163
01:20:11,689 --> 01:20:13,773
Night drops as always, sir.

1164
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:45,930
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1165
01:20:46,015 --> 01:20:48,808
- Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.
- Yes, sir.

1166
01:20:48,893 --> 01:20:52,646
Tell them if they over-starch my shirts again,
they'll hear about it from me.

1167
01:20:52,730 --> 01:20:54,731
How do I look?

1168
01:20:54,815 --> 01:20:57,525
- Very nice, sir.
- Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1169
01:20:57,610 --> 01:20:59,319
The Governor's going to be there.

1170
01:21:00,738 --> 01:21:02,781
Want the rest of this?

1171
01:21:02,865 --> 01:21:04,949
The woman can't bake worth shit.

1172
01:21:06,327 --> 01:21:08,119
Thank you, sir.

1173
01:21:10,289 --> 01:21:14,042
- He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, I hear.
- What you hear isn't half of it.

1174
01:21:14,126 --> 01:21:16,586
He's got scams you haven't even dreamed of.

1175
01:21:16,671 --> 01:21:18,713
Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1176
01:21:18,798 --> 01:21:21,675
There's a river of dirty money
running through this place.

1177
01:21:21,759 --> 01:21:25,011
But the problem with having all that money
is you'll have to explain

1178
01:21:25,096 --> 01:21:27,681
- where it came from.
- That's where I come in.

1179
01:21:27,765 --> 01:21:30,266
I channel it, filter it, funnel it.

1180
01:21:30,351 --> 01:21:32,894
Stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.

1181
01:21:32,978 --> 01:21:35,647
I send that money out into the real world.

1182
01:21:35,731 --> 01:21:39,359
- And when it comes back...
- Clean as a virgin's honey pot, huh?

1183
01:21:39,443 --> 01:21:40,652
Cleaner.

1184
01:21:40,736 --> 01:21:44,364
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1185
01:21:47,118 --> 01:21:51,538
If they ever catch on, though, he's gonna
wind up in here wearing a number himself.

1186
01:21:51,622 --> 01:21:54,874
Now, Red, I thought you had
a little more faith in me than that.

1187
01:21:54,959 --> 01:21:58,253
I know you're good, Andy,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1188
01:21:58,337 --> 01:22:01,339
Now, anybody gets curious,
the FBI, the IRS, whatever,

1189
01:22:01,424 --> 01:22:04,259
it's gonna lead to somebody.

1190
01:22:04,343 --> 01:22:06,302
Sure it is. But not to me.

1191
01:22:06,387 --> 01:22:08,388
And certainly not to the Warden.

1192
01:22:12,435 --> 01:22:13,727
All right. Who?

1193
01:22:13,811 --> 01:22:15,520
Randall Stevens.

1194
01:22:15,604 --> 01:22:16,771
Who?

1195
01:22:17,857 --> 01:22:22,569
The silent silent partner. He's the guilty one,
Your Honor. The man with the bank accounts.

1196
01:22:22,653 --> 01:22:24,821
That's where the filtering process starts.

1197
01:22:24,905 --> 01:22:28,074
If they trace anything,
it's just going to lead to him.

1198
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:29,743
But who is he?

1199
01:22:29,827 --> 01:22:31,870
He's a phantom, an apparition.

1200
01:22:31,954 --> 01:22:33,913
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1201
01:22:33,998 --> 01:22:36,166
I conjured him...

1202
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:38,293
out of thin air.

1203
01:22:38,377 --> 01:22:41,212
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1204
01:22:44,341 --> 01:22:46,718
Andy, you canâ€™t just make a person up.

1205
01:22:46,802 --> 01:22:49,929
Sure you can, if you know how
the system works, where the cracks are.

1206
01:22:50,014 --> 01:22:53,516
It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.

1207
01:22:53,601 --> 01:22:56,227
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate,

1208
01:22:56,312 --> 01:22:58,646
a driver's license, social security number.

1209
01:22:58,731 --> 01:22:59,939
You're shitting me?

1210
01:23:00,024 --> 01:23:01,983
If they ever trace any of those accounts,

1211
01:23:02,067 --> 01:23:04,944
they're going to wind up chasing
a figment of my imagination.

1212
01:23:05,029 --> 01:23:07,113
Well, I'll be damned.

1213
01:23:08,407 --> 01:23:10,450
Did I say you were good?

1214
01:23:10,534 --> 01:23:12,702
Shit, you're a Rembrandt!

1215
01:23:12,787 --> 01:23:14,829
You know, the funny thing is,

1216
01:23:14,914 --> 01:23:18,875
on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

1217
01:23:19,919 --> 01:23:22,295
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1218
01:23:31,055 --> 01:23:32,430
Ever bother you?

1219
01:23:33,474 --> 01:23:36,893
I don't run the scams, Red,
I just process the profits.

1220
01:23:36,977 --> 01:23:39,020
Fine line maybe but...

1221
01:23:39,104 --> 01:23:41,815
I also built that library

1222
01:23:41,899 --> 01:23:44,526
and used it to help a dozen guys
get a high school diploma.

1223
01:23:44,610 --> 01:23:46,486
Why do you think the Warden lets me do it?

1224
01:23:46,570 --> 01:23:49,322
To keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1225
01:23:49,406 --> 01:23:51,533
Money instead of sheets.

1226
01:23:51,617 --> 01:23:54,327
Well, I work cheap. That's the trade-off.

1227
01:23:54,411 --> 01:23:56,496
(Siren wails)

1228
01:23:59,917 --> 01:24:02,126
â™ª JOHNNY OTIS: Willy And The Hand Jive

1229
01:24:09,927 --> 01:24:11,719
â™ª I know a cat named...

1230
01:24:11,804 --> 01:24:14,472
RED: Tommy Williams
came to Shawshank in 1965

1231
01:24:14,557 --> 01:24:16,599
on a two-year stretch for B&E.

1232
01:24:16,684 --> 01:24:18,810
That's breaking and entering to you.

1233
01:24:18,894 --> 01:24:23,523
The cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.

1234
01:24:23,607 --> 01:24:25,358
Young punk.

1235
01:24:25,442 --> 01:24:27,485
Mr. Rock'n'roll.

1236
01:24:27,570 --> 01:24:29,237
Cocky as hell.

1237
01:24:29,321 --> 01:24:31,906
Hey, come on, old boys! Moving like molasses!

1238
01:24:31,991 --> 01:24:33,950
Making me look bad.

1239
01:24:33,951 --> 01:24:35,910
RED: We liked him immediately.

1240
01:24:35,995 --> 01:24:38,037
So I'm backing out the door, right?

1241
01:24:38,122 --> 01:24:39,831
And I got the TV like this.

1242
01:24:39,915 --> 01:24:43,751
It was a big old thing. I couldn't see shit.
Suddenly, I hears this voice.

1243
01:24:43,836 --> 01:24:45,879
"Freeze, kid! Hands in the air."

1244
01:24:45,963 --> 01:24:47,630
Well, I just stand there,

1245
01:24:47,715 --> 01:24:50,508
holding onto that TV. So, finally, the voice says,

1246
01:24:50,593 --> 01:24:52,552
"Do you hear what I said, boy?"

1247
01:24:52,636 --> 01:24:55,013
I say, "Yes, sir, I sure did.

1248
01:24:55,097 --> 01:24:58,725
But if I drop this fucking thing,
you got me on destruction of property, too."

1249
01:24:58,809 --> 01:25:00,935
(Laughter)

1250
01:25:02,813 --> 01:25:05,523
Hey, you've done a stretch in Cashman, right?

1251
01:25:05,608 --> 01:25:09,444
Yeah. Yeah, that was an easy piece of time,
let me tell you.

1252
01:25:09,528 --> 01:25:12,155
Weekend furloughs, work programs.

1253
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:13,656
Not like here.

1254
01:25:13,741 --> 01:25:16,075
Sounds like you done time
all over New England.

1255
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:21,247
Yeah, I've been in and out since I was 13. You
name the place, chances are I've been there.

1256
01:25:21,332 --> 01:25:25,335
Perhaps it's time you tried a new profession?

1257
01:25:25,419 --> 01:25:30,506
What I mean is, you don't seem to be a good
thief. Maybe you should try something else.

1258
01:25:30,591 --> 01:25:34,427
Yeah, well, what the hell
do you know about it, Capone?

1259
01:25:34,511 --> 01:25:36,262
What are you in for?

1260
01:25:36,347 --> 01:25:37,972
Me?

1261
01:25:39,475 --> 01:25:41,559
The lawyer fucked me.

1262
01:25:45,272 --> 01:25:48,691
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

1263
01:25:50,527 --> 01:25:53,071
(Laughter breaks out)

1264
01:25:56,158 --> 01:26:00,328
RED: As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.

1265
01:26:01,372 --> 01:26:06,501
Maybe it was the thought of them on the streets
or his child growing up not knowing her daddy.

1266
01:26:06,585 --> 01:26:10,421
Whatever it was,
something lit a fire under that boy's ass.

1267
01:26:14,385 --> 01:26:17,637
I was thinking of maybe
trying for my high school equivalency.

1268
01:26:17,721 --> 01:26:20,306
I hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.

1269
01:26:21,517 --> 01:26:23,726
I don't waste time on losers, Tommy.

1270
01:26:25,312 --> 01:26:27,397
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1271
01:26:29,233 --> 01:26:31,317
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

1272
01:26:32,987 --> 01:26:35,029
You really mean that?

1273
01:26:35,114 --> 01:26:36,781
Yes, sir, I do.

1274
01:26:36,865 --> 01:26:38,992
Good. Because if we do this,

1275
01:26:39,076 --> 01:26:41,828
we do it all the way, 100%, nothing half-assed.

1276
01:26:42,955 --> 01:26:45,039
The thing is, see...

1277
01:26:46,208 --> 01:26:48,042
..I don't read so good.

1278
01:26:49,169 --> 01:26:50,378
Well.

1279
01:26:52,131 --> 01:26:54,173
You don't read...

1280
01:26:54,258 --> 01:26:56,342
so well.

1281
01:26:57,803 --> 01:26:59,470
We'll get to that.

1282
01:27:00,556 --> 01:27:02,306
- R.
- R...

1283
01:27:02,391 --> 01:27:03,766
- S.
- S...

1284
01:27:03,851 --> 01:27:06,019
RED: So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1285
01:27:06,103 --> 01:27:08,521
He started walking him through his ABCs.

1286
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:12,775
Tommy took to it pretty well, too.

1287
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:15,820
The boy found brains he never knew he had.

1288
01:27:18,157 --> 01:27:21,951
Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.

1289
01:27:22,036 --> 01:27:23,995
He really liked the kid.

1290
01:27:24,079 --> 01:27:27,248
It gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.

1291
01:27:28,292 --> 01:27:30,334
But that wasn't the only reason.

1292
01:27:30,419 --> 01:27:32,879
Prison time is slow time.

1293
01:27:33,922 --> 01:27:36,174
So you do what you can to keep going.

1294
01:27:36,258 --> 01:27:38,509
Some fellas collect stamps.

1295
01:27:38,510 --> 01:27:41,137
Others build matchstick houses.

1296
01:27:42,181 --> 01:27:44,557
Andy built a library.

1297
01:27:45,601 --> 01:27:47,643
Now he needed a new project.

1298
01:27:47,728 --> 01:27:49,771
Tommy was it.

1299
01:27:49,855 --> 01:27:54,067
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

1300
01:27:54,151 --> 01:27:57,779
The same reason
he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1301
01:27:59,156 --> 01:28:00,656
In prison,

1302
01:28:00,741 --> 01:28:03,868
a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1303
01:28:05,329 --> 01:28:09,791
By 1966, right about the time
Tommy was getting ready to take his exams,

1304
01:28:09,792 --> 01:28:11,834
it was lovely Raquel.

1305
01:28:14,213 --> 01:28:15,838
(Clock ticks)

1306
01:28:29,103 --> 01:28:30,144
Time.

1307
01:28:36,151 --> 01:28:37,443
Well?

1308
01:28:38,529 --> 01:28:40,071
Well, it's for shit.

1309
01:28:40,155 --> 01:28:42,657
I wasted a whole fucking year of my time

1310
01:28:42,741 --> 01:28:45,910
- with this bullshit.
- It's probably not as bad as you think.

1311
01:28:45,994 --> 01:28:49,705
It's worse. I didn't get one thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1312
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:52,291
Let's see how the score comes out.

1313
01:28:52,376 --> 01:28:55,002
Well, I'll tell you how the goddamn score
comes out.

1314
01:28:56,797 --> 01:28:58,714
Two points right there.

1315
01:28:58,799 --> 01:29:00,591
There's your goddamn score!

1316
01:29:00,676 --> 01:29:04,512
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5x5 is 25.

1317
01:29:05,597 --> 01:29:07,140
Fuck this place!

1318
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:08,432
Fuck it!

1319
01:29:27,244 --> 01:29:29,996
I feel bad. I let him down.

1320
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:32,165
Ah, that's crap, kid.

1321
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:33,708
He's proud of you.

1322
01:29:33,792 --> 01:29:36,919
We've been friends a long time
so I know him as good as anybody.

1323
01:29:37,004 --> 01:29:39,881
- A smart fellow, ain't he?
- As smart as they come.

1324
01:29:39,965 --> 01:29:42,008
He used to be a banker on the outside.

1325
01:29:42,092 --> 01:29:44,135
What's he in here for, anyway?

1326
01:29:44,219 --> 01:29:45,720
Murder.

1327
01:29:46,847 --> 01:29:48,598
The hell you say!

1328
01:29:50,726 --> 01:29:53,019
You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.

1329
01:29:54,062 --> 01:29:56,522
He caught his wife in bed with some golf pro.

1330
01:29:56,607 --> 01:29:58,691
He greased them both.

1331
01:30:06,575 --> 01:30:08,451
What?

1332
01:30:08,535 --> 01:30:10,912
About four years ago,

1333
01:30:10,996 --> 01:30:14,081
I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.

1334
01:30:15,334 --> 01:30:18,419
I stole a car. It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1335
01:30:19,713 --> 01:30:21,756
About six months left to go,

1336
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,883
I get a new cellmate in.

1337
01:30:23,967 --> 01:30:25,843
Elmo Blatch.

1338
01:30:26,887 --> 01:30:28,471
Big, twitchy fucker.

1339
01:30:28,472 --> 01:30:30,765
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.

1340
01:30:30,849 --> 01:30:32,892
You know what I'm saying?

1341
01:30:32,976 --> 01:30:35,019
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1342
01:30:35,103 --> 01:30:38,314
He said he'd pulled hundreds of jobs.

1343
01:30:38,398 --> 01:30:40,274
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.

1344
01:30:40,359 --> 01:30:43,361
You'd cut a loud fart,
he'd jump three feet in the air.

1345
01:30:44,488 --> 01:30:46,530
Talked all the time, too.

1346
01:30:46,615 --> 01:30:48,950
That's the other thing. He never shut up.

1347
01:30:49,034 --> 01:30:51,077
Places he'd been in,

1348
01:30:51,161 --> 01:30:53,829
jobs he'd pulled, women he'd fucked.

1349
01:30:53,914 --> 01:30:56,332
Even people he'd killed.

1350
01:30:58,168 --> 01:31:00,544
People who gave him shit.

1351
01:31:01,588 --> 01:31:03,631
That's how he put it.

1352
01:31:03,715 --> 01:31:05,258
So...

1353
01:31:05,342 --> 01:31:07,426
one night, like a joke,

1354
01:31:08,470 --> 01:31:11,764
I say to him, I say,
"Yeah, Elmo, who did you kill?"

1355
01:31:11,848 --> 01:31:13,641
So he says...

1356
01:31:13,725 --> 01:31:17,353
I got me this job one time
bussing tables at a country club.

1357
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:22,066
So I could case
all these big rich pricks that come in.

1358
01:31:24,486 --> 01:31:26,487
So I pick out this guy,

1359
01:31:27,531 --> 01:31:30,116
go in one night and do his place.

1360
01:31:32,286 --> 01:31:34,287
He wakes up.

1361
01:31:34,371 --> 01:31:36,414
He gives me shit.

1362
01:31:37,457 --> 01:31:39,542
So I killed him.

1363
01:31:40,585 --> 01:31:42,670
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1364
01:31:44,965 --> 01:31:46,882
That's the best part.

1365
01:31:47,926 --> 01:31:51,137
She's fucking this prick, see, this golf pro.

1366
01:31:51,221 --> 01:31:53,306
But she's married to some other guy.

1367
01:31:54,349 --> 01:31:56,434
Some hotshot banker.

1368
01:31:58,228 --> 01:32:00,313
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1369
01:32:11,450 --> 01:32:15,286
I have to say
that's the most amazing story I ever heard.

1370
01:32:16,913 --> 01:32:19,790
What amazes me most is
you were taken in by it.

1371
01:32:19,875 --> 01:32:21,500
Sir?

1372
01:32:21,585 --> 01:32:23,252
Well...

1373
01:32:23,337 --> 01:32:26,714
it's obvious this fella Williams
is impressed with you.

1374
01:32:26,798 --> 01:32:28,883
He hears your tale of woe

1375
01:32:28,967 --> 01:32:31,886
and quite naturally wants to cheer you up.

1376
01:32:31,970 --> 01:32:34,013
He's young, not terribly bright.

1377
01:32:34,097 --> 01:32:37,975
Not surprising he wouldn't know
what a state he'd put you in.

1378
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:40,186
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1379
01:32:40,270 --> 01:32:44,315
Well, let's say, for the moment,
this Blatch does exist.

1380
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:47,526
You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry,

1381
01:32:47,611 --> 01:32:49,820
"Yes, I did it! I confess!

1382
01:32:49,905 --> 01:32:52,114
And by the way,
add a life term to my sentence"?

1383
01:32:52,199 --> 01:32:55,368
That doesn't matter.
With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.

1384
01:32:55,452 --> 01:32:58,662
That's assuming Blatch is even still there.

1385
01:32:58,747 --> 01:33:00,790
The chances are he'd be released by now.

1386
01:33:00,874 --> 01:33:03,459
They'd have his last address,
names of relatives.

1387
01:33:03,543 --> 01:33:05,711
There's a chance, isn't there?

1388
01:33:07,756 --> 01:33:09,632
How can you be so obtuse?

1389
01:33:09,716 --> 01:33:11,217
What?

1390
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:14,553
What did you call me?

1391
01:33:14,638 --> 01:33:16,472
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1392
01:33:16,556 --> 01:33:18,349
Son, you're forgetting yourself.

1393
01:33:18,433 --> 01:33:21,268
The country club will have his old timecards,

1394
01:33:21,353 --> 01:33:23,479
records, W-2s,

1395
01:33:23,563 --> 01:33:27,566
- with his name on them.
- If you indulge this fantasy, that's your business.

1396
01:33:27,651 --> 01:33:31,612
- Don't make it mine. This meeting is over.
- Sir, if I were to ever get out,

1397
01:33:31,696 --> 01:33:36,700
I would never mention what goes on in here.
I'd be as indictable as you for laundering money.

1398
01:33:38,495 --> 01:33:41,497
Don't ever mention money to me again,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1399
01:33:41,581 --> 01:33:43,457
Not in this office.

1400
01:33:43,458 --> 01:33:45,584
Not anywhere! Get in here now.

1401
01:33:45,669 --> 01:33:48,921
I'm just trying to set your mind at ease,
that's all. Sir, I...

1402
01:33:49,005 --> 01:33:50,381
Solitary. A month.

1403
01:33:50,465 --> 01:33:52,633
- Yes, sir.
- What's the matter with you?

1404
01:33:52,717 --> 01:33:55,970
- Get him out of here.
- This is my chance to get out! Don't you see?

1405
01:33:55,971 --> 01:33:57,972
It's my life! Don't you understand?

1406
01:33:58,056 --> 01:34:00,516
- Get him out! Get him out!
- This is my life!

1407
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:01,851
No!

1408
01:34:01,935 --> 01:34:03,769
A month in the hole.

1409
01:34:03,854 --> 01:34:06,439
It's the longest damn stretch I ever heard of.

1410
01:34:06,523 --> 01:34:08,315
It's all my fault.

1411
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:09,817
Oh, bullshit.

1412
01:34:09,901 --> 01:34:13,195
You didn't pull the trigger
and you certainly didn't convict him.

1413
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,656
Red, are you saying that Andy is innocent?

1414
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:17,908
I mean, for real innocent?

1415
01:34:17,993 --> 01:34:20,035
It looks that way.

1416
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:22,163
Sweet Jesus.

1417
01:34:22,247 --> 01:34:24,290
How long's he been here now?

1418
01:34:24,374 --> 01:34:26,417
1947. What is that?

1419
01:34:26,501 --> 01:34:28,043
- 19 years.
TOMMY: 19 years...

1420
01:34:28,128 --> 01:34:30,754
GUARD: Williams, Thomas.
- Yeah, over here.

1421
01:34:33,133 --> 01:34:35,384
- Paxon, Edward.
- Yeah.

1422
01:34:36,595 --> 01:34:39,513
What you got? Board of Education.

1423
01:34:39,598 --> 01:34:42,266
- The son of a bitch mailed it.
- Looks like he did.

1424
01:34:42,350 --> 01:34:45,394
Are you gonna open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1425
01:34:45,479 --> 01:34:47,563
The thumb up my butt sounds better.

1426
01:34:48,607 --> 01:34:51,358
Hey, Skeet, come on,
give me that, you shithead.

1427
01:34:52,402 --> 01:34:54,612
- Floyd, come on.
- Over here, over here!

1428
01:34:55,655 --> 01:34:57,740
Hey, Red!

1429
01:34:58,867 --> 01:35:01,285
Come on, will you throw that away, please?

1430
01:35:06,875 --> 01:35:08,959
Well, shit.

1431
01:35:21,181 --> 01:35:23,891
The kid passed. C+ average.

1432
01:35:23,975 --> 01:35:26,060
Thought you'd like to know.

1433
01:35:42,619 --> 01:35:44,703
The Warden wants to talk.

1434
01:35:58,093 --> 01:35:59,218
Out here?

1435
01:35:59,302 --> 01:36:01,387
That's what the man said.

1436
01:36:17,696 --> 01:36:19,488
Warden?

1437
01:36:19,573 --> 01:36:21,657
Tommy.

1438
01:36:27,122 --> 01:36:28,581
Tommy...

1439
01:36:28,665 --> 01:36:32,751
I'm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

1440
01:36:34,170 --> 01:36:36,255
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1441
01:36:54,733 --> 01:36:56,817
We got a situation here.

1442
01:36:57,861 --> 01:36:59,903
I think you can appreciate that.

1443
01:36:59,988 --> 01:37:01,447
Yes, sir.

1444
01:37:01,531 --> 01:37:03,032
I sure can.

1445
01:37:03,116 --> 01:37:07,161
I tell you, son, this thing really came along
and knocked my wind out.

1446
01:37:08,872 --> 01:37:11,415
It's got me up nights, that's the truth.

1447
01:37:13,627 --> 01:37:15,711
The right thing to do.

1448
01:37:17,047 --> 01:37:20,049
Sometimes it's hard to know what that is.

1449
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:23,802
You understand?

1450
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:27,264
I need your help, son.

1451
01:37:28,683 --> 01:37:30,768
If I'm going to move on this,

1452
01:37:30,769 --> 01:37:33,520
there can't be the least little shred of doubt.

1453
01:37:35,065 --> 01:37:38,484
I have to know
if what you told Dufresne was the truth.

1454
01:37:38,568 --> 01:37:40,152
Yes, sir.

1455
01:37:40,153 --> 01:37:41,779
Absolutely.

1456
01:37:41,863 --> 01:37:44,948
Would you be willing
to swear before a judge and jury,

1457
01:37:45,033 --> 01:37:47,451
having placed your hand on the Good Book

1458
01:37:47,452 --> 01:37:50,162
and taken an oath before Almighty God himself?

1459
01:37:50,246 --> 01:37:52,373
Just give me that chance.

1460
01:37:56,294 --> 01:37:57,961
That's what I thought.

1461
01:38:30,412 --> 01:38:32,496
(Keys rattle)

1462
01:38:45,051 --> 01:38:47,136
I'm sure by now you've heard...

1463
01:38:48,388 --> 01:38:49,763
A terrible thing.

1464
01:38:51,224 --> 01:38:54,810
A man that young, less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1465
01:38:55,895 --> 01:38:58,522
It broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.

1466
01:38:59,566 --> 01:39:01,650
Truly, it did.

1467
01:39:03,695 --> 01:39:05,779
We just have to put it behind us.

1468
01:39:07,949 --> 01:39:09,366
Move on.

1469
01:39:10,827 --> 01:39:12,703
I'm done.

1470
01:39:13,747 --> 01:39:15,831
Everything stops.

1471
01:39:16,875 --> 01:39:19,710
Get someone else to run your scams.

1472
01:39:21,045 --> 01:39:23,130
Nothing stops.

1473
01:39:24,174 --> 01:39:26,258
Nothing.

1474
01:39:28,011 --> 01:39:30,095
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1475
01:39:31,973 --> 01:39:34,558
No more protection from the guards.

1476
01:39:34,642 --> 01:39:36,977
I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton

1477
01:39:37,061 --> 01:39:39,229
and cast you down with the Sodomites.

1478
01:39:40,982 --> 01:39:43,484
You'll think you've been fucked by a train.

1479
01:39:44,778 --> 01:39:46,820
And the library?

1480
01:39:46,905 --> 01:39:48,030
Gone.

1481
01:39:48,114 --> 01:39:50,491
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1482
01:39:51,534 --> 01:39:54,328
We'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.

1483
01:39:54,412 --> 01:39:56,455
They'll see the flames for miles.

1484
01:39:56,539 --> 01:39:59,041
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1485
01:40:00,627 --> 01:40:02,544
You understand me?

1486
01:40:02,629 --> 01:40:04,713
Catching my drift?

1487
01:40:07,801 --> 01:40:09,885
Or am I being obtuse?

1488
01:40:21,022 --> 01:40:23,148
Give him another month to think about it.

1489
01:40:31,658 --> 01:40:33,742
(Lock clicks)

1490
01:41:10,738 --> 01:41:13,782
My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.

1491
01:41:13,867 --> 01:41:15,951
Like a closed book.

1492
01:41:17,161 --> 01:41:19,913
Complained about it all the time.

1493
01:41:19,998 --> 01:41:22,082
She was beautiful.

1494
01:41:24,294 --> 01:41:26,378
God, I loved her.

1495
01:41:29,382 --> 01:41:31,717
I just didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1496
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:36,305
I killed her, Red.

1497
01:41:37,765 --> 01:41:39,850
I didn't pull the trigger.

1498
01:41:41,269 --> 01:41:43,353
But I drove her away.

1499
01:41:44,564 --> 01:41:47,107
That's why she died, because of me.

1500
01:41:47,191 --> 01:41:49,276
The way I am.

1501
01:41:57,619 --> 01:41:59,703
That don't make you a murderer.

1502
01:42:02,916 --> 01:42:05,000
A bad husband, maybe.

1503
01:42:08,379 --> 01:42:11,757
Feel bad about it if you want to,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1504
01:42:11,841 --> 01:42:13,258
No, I didn't.

1505
01:42:13,343 --> 01:42:15,385
Somebody else did.

1506
01:42:16,679 --> 01:42:18,764
And I wound up in here.

1507
01:42:21,142 --> 01:42:23,226
Bad luck, I guess.

1508
01:42:26,147 --> 01:42:27,856
Yeah.

1509
01:42:27,941 --> 01:42:30,233
It floats around.

1510
01:42:30,318 --> 01:42:32,778
It's got to land on somebody.

1511
01:42:32,862 --> 01:42:35,113
It was my turn, that's all.

1512
01:42:36,199 --> 01:42:38,659
I was in the path of the tornado.

1513
01:42:45,249 --> 01:42:49,002
I just didn't expect
the storm would last as long as it has.

1514
01:42:53,091 --> 01:42:55,008
Do you think you'll ever get out of here?

1515
01:42:56,260 --> 01:42:57,928
Me?

1516
01:43:00,223 --> 01:43:01,682
Yeah.

1517
01:43:02,725 --> 01:43:04,685
One day, when I've got a long, white beard

1518
01:43:04,769 --> 01:43:08,271
and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs,
they'll let me out.

1519
01:43:10,191 --> 01:43:12,275
I tell you where I'd go.

1520
01:43:13,486 --> 01:43:15,112
Zihuatanejo.

1521
01:43:15,196 --> 01:43:17,114
Zi...what?

1522
01:43:17,198 --> 01:43:19,241
Zihuatanejo.

1523
01:43:19,325 --> 01:43:21,410
It's in Mexico.

1524
01:43:23,204 --> 01:43:25,414
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1525
01:43:26,666 --> 01:43:29,042
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1526
01:43:29,127 --> 01:43:30,585
No.

1527
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:32,754
They say it has no memory.

1528
01:43:35,216 --> 01:43:37,759
That's where I want to live the rest of my life.

1529
01:43:39,345 --> 01:43:41,430
A warm place with no memory.

1530
01:43:44,726 --> 01:43:47,019
Open up a little hotel,

1531
01:43:48,855 --> 01:43:50,731
right on the beach.

1532
01:43:50,815 --> 01:43:52,858
Buy some worthless old boat,

1533
01:43:52,942 --> 01:43:55,027
fix it up new.

1534
01:43:57,989 --> 01:43:59,197
Take my guests out.

1535
01:43:59,282 --> 01:44:01,366
Charter fishing.

1536
01:44:05,288 --> 01:44:07,914
Zihuatanejo, huh?

1537
01:44:10,543 --> 01:44:14,421
In a place like that, I could use a man
who knows how to get things.

1538
01:44:20,845 --> 01:44:23,555
I don't think I could make it on the outside, Andy.

1539
01:44:30,313 --> 01:44:32,397
I've been in here most of my life.

1540
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:35,692
I'm an institutional man now.

1541
01:44:35,777 --> 01:44:37,861
Just like Brooks was.

1542
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:41,531
Well, you underestimate yourself.

1543
01:44:41,616 --> 01:44:43,700
I don't think so.

1544
01:44:46,329 --> 01:44:50,540
I mean...in here, I'm the guy
who can get things for you, sure.

1545
01:44:50,625 --> 01:44:54,544
But outside, all you need is the Yellow Pages.

1546
01:44:54,629 --> 01:44:57,047
Hell, I wouldn't even know where to begin.

1547
01:44:59,133 --> 01:45:01,468
The Pacific Ocean?

1548
01:45:01,552 --> 01:45:03,595
Shit.

1549
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:06,848
- About scare me to death, something that big.
- Not me.

1550
01:45:06,933 --> 01:45:10,393
I didn't shoot my wife and I didn't shoot her lover.

1551
01:45:12,313 --> 01:45:15,941
Whatever mistakes I've made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1552
01:45:16,025 --> 01:45:18,193
That hotel, that boat.

1553
01:45:19,779 --> 01:45:21,947
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1554
01:45:26,577 --> 01:45:29,454
I don't think you ought to be
doing this to yourself, Andy.

1555
01:45:29,539 --> 01:45:31,581
These are just shitty pipe dreams.

1556
01:45:31,666 --> 01:45:34,626
I mean, Mexico is way the hell down there
and you're in here.

1557
01:45:34,710 --> 01:45:36,753
And that's the way it is.

1558
01:45:36,838 --> 01:45:39,464
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

1559
01:45:41,217 --> 01:45:43,301
It's down there and I'm in here.

1560
01:45:46,013 --> 01:45:48,807
I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really.

1561
01:45:51,644 --> 01:45:53,687
Get busy living

1562
01:45:53,771 --> 01:45:56,690
or get busy dying.

1563
01:46:00,486 --> 01:46:02,571
Andy.

1564
01:46:05,032 --> 01:46:07,117
Red.

1565
01:46:08,161 --> 01:46:10,579
If you ever get out of here, do me a favor.

1566
01:46:10,663 --> 01:46:12,497
Sure, Andy.

1567
01:46:12,582 --> 01:46:13,915
Anything.

1568
01:46:15,001 --> 01:46:18,461
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1569
01:46:20,464 --> 01:46:24,259
- Well, just... There's a lot of hayfields up there.
- One in particular.

1570
01:46:24,343 --> 01:46:26,386
It's got a long rock wall

1571
01:46:26,470 --> 01:46:28,388
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1572
01:46:28,472 --> 01:46:31,183
It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.

1573
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:35,270
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1574
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:40,275
We went there for a picnic
and made love under that oak.

1575
01:46:41,777 --> 01:46:43,862
I asked and she said yes.

1576
01:46:47,992 --> 01:46:50,035
Promise me, Red,

1577
01:46:50,119 --> 01:46:52,120
if you ever get out,

1578
01:46:52,205 --> 01:46:54,247
find that spot.

1579
01:46:55,291 --> 01:47:00,754
At the base of that wall, you'll find a rock that has
no earthly business in a Maine hayfield.

1580
01:47:00,838 --> 01:47:03,340
A piece of black, volcanic glass.

1581
01:47:06,510 --> 01:47:09,304
There's something buried under it
I want you to have.

1582
01:47:09,388 --> 01:47:11,389
What, Andy?

1583
01:47:11,474 --> 01:47:13,558
What's buried under there?

1584
01:47:15,353 --> 01:47:18,730
You'll have to pry it up to see.

1585
01:47:24,070 --> 01:47:26,154
No, I'm telling you, the guy is...

1586
01:47:27,198 --> 01:47:29,282
He's talking funnier.

1587
01:47:29,367 --> 01:47:32,744
- I'm really worried about him.
- We ought to keep an eye on him.

1588
01:47:32,828 --> 01:47:36,873
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's got that cell all to himself.

1589
01:47:37,959 --> 01:47:39,417
Oh, Lord.

1590
01:47:39,502 --> 01:47:41,544
What?

1591
01:47:43,214 --> 01:47:45,548
Andy come down to the loading dock today.

1592
01:47:45,633 --> 01:47:49,135
- He asked me for a length of rope.
- Rope?

1593
01:47:49,220 --> 01:47:51,054
Six feet long.

1594
01:47:51,138 --> 01:47:52,597
And you gave it to him?

1595
01:47:52,682 --> 01:47:55,350
Sure I did. Why wouldn't I?

1596
01:47:55,351 --> 01:47:57,060
Jesus, Heywood.

1597
01:47:57,144 --> 01:47:59,396
Hey, how the hell was I supposed to know?

1598
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:01,398
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1599
01:48:01,482 --> 01:48:02,524
No.

1600
01:48:03,567 --> 01:48:05,777
Andy would never do that.

1601
01:48:05,778 --> 01:48:07,862
Never.

1602
01:48:08,906 --> 01:48:10,991
I don't know.

1603
01:48:13,035 --> 01:48:15,120
Every man has his breaking point.

1604
01:48:17,748 --> 01:48:18,999
Lickety-split.

1605
01:48:19,083 --> 01:48:21,960
- I want to get home.
- Just about finished, sir.

1606
01:48:38,060 --> 01:48:40,145
Three deposits tonight.

1607
01:48:48,529 --> 01:48:50,613
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1608
01:48:50,614 --> 01:48:54,075
And shine my shoes.
I want 'em looking like mirrors.

1609
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:55,535
Yes, sir.

1610
01:49:00,833 --> 01:49:02,500
It's good having you back, Andy.

1611
01:49:02,585 --> 01:49:05,337
The place wasn't the same without you.

1612
01:49:07,465 --> 01:49:09,549
(Whistles)

1613
01:49:52,385 --> 01:49:55,136
GUARD: Lights out!
(Click of light switches)

1614
01:49:59,433 --> 01:50:01,518
(Footsteps)

1615
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:09,484
(Outer door closes)

1616
01:50:25,876 --> 01:50:28,169
RED: I've had some long nights in stir.

1617
01:50:29,213 --> 01:50:31,923
Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts,

1618
01:50:32,007 --> 01:50:33,842
time can draw out like a blade.

1619
01:50:33,843 --> 01:50:35,927
(Thunder rumbles)

1620
01:50:40,224 --> 01:50:42,559
That was the longest night of my life.

1621
01:50:52,778 --> 01:50:55,113
(Gate buzzer)

1622
01:50:58,701 --> 01:51:00,326
GUARD: Give me a count.

1623
01:51:04,665 --> 01:51:06,708
Tier 3 South. Clear.

1624
01:51:06,792 --> 01:51:08,126
Tier 4 North. Clear.

1625
01:51:08,210 --> 01:51:11,796
- Tier 3 North. Clear.
- Man missing on Tier 2.

1626
01:51:11,881 --> 01:51:14,966
- Cell 245.
- Dufresne.

1627
01:51:15,050 --> 01:51:17,969
Get your ass out here, boy.
You're holding up the show.

1628
01:51:20,473 --> 01:51:24,517
Don't make me come down there.
I'll thump your skull for you.

1629
01:51:32,109 --> 01:51:35,487
Damn it, Dufresne, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

1630
01:51:35,571 --> 01:51:38,656
You'd better be sick or dead in there,
I shit you not!

1631
01:51:38,741 --> 01:51:40,575
You hear me?

1632
01:51:47,082 --> 01:51:49,167
Oh, my holy God.

1633
01:52:01,263 --> 01:52:03,348
(Siren wails)

1634
01:52:06,018 --> 01:52:08,728
I want every man on this cell block questioned.

1635
01:52:08,729 --> 01:52:10,939
- Start with that friend of his.
- Who?

1636
01:52:11,023 --> 01:52:12,232
Him!

1637
01:52:14,151 --> 01:52:16,236
Open 237.

1638
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:21,366
What do you mean, he just wasn't here?

1639
01:52:21,450 --> 01:52:22,992
Don't say that to me, Haig.

1640
01:52:23,077 --> 01:52:25,328
Don't say that to me again.

1641
01:52:25,412 --> 01:52:26,496
But, sir, he wasn't.

1642
01:52:26,580 --> 01:52:28,748
I can see that, Haig!

1643
01:52:28,832 --> 01:52:30,625
You think I'm blind?

1644
01:52:30,626 --> 01:52:33,753
Is that what you're saying? Am I blind, Haig?

1645
01:52:33,837 --> 01:52:34,837
No, sir.

1646
01:52:34,922 --> 01:52:36,965
What about you?

1647
01:52:37,049 --> 01:52:38,883
Are you blind?

1648
01:52:38,968 --> 01:52:41,511
- Tell me what this is.
- Last night's count.

1649
01:52:41,595 --> 01:52:44,889
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. See? Right there.

1650
01:52:44,974 --> 01:52:46,849
Dufresne.

1651
01:52:48,102 --> 01:52:49,769
He was in his cell at lights out.

1652
01:52:49,853 --> 01:52:53,064
It stands to reason
he'd still be here in the morning.

1653
01:52:54,149 --> 01:52:56,025
I want him found.

1654
01:52:56,110 --> 01:52:58,695
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast.

1655
01:52:58,779 --> 01:52:59,821
Now!

1656
01:52:59,822 --> 01:53:01,322
Yes, sir!

1657
01:53:02,449 --> 01:53:05,034
Let's go, let's go!
Move your butts! Move it!

1658
01:53:07,871 --> 01:53:08,913
Stand.

1659
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:11,291
Well?

1660
01:53:14,670 --> 01:53:15,795
Well, what?

1661
01:53:15,879 --> 01:53:19,340
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1662
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:22,010
He must have said something.

1663
01:53:22,094 --> 01:53:24,137
No, sir, Warden.

1664
01:53:24,221 --> 01:53:25,680
Not a word.

1665
01:53:27,683 --> 01:53:29,684
Lord, it's a miracle!

1666
01:53:30,728 --> 01:53:33,187
A man up and vanished like a fart in the wind.

1667
01:53:33,272 --> 01:53:35,023
Nothing left but...

1668
01:53:35,107 --> 01:53:38,026
some damn rocks on a windowsill.

1669
01:53:38,110 --> 01:53:39,861
And that cupcake on the wall.

1670
01:53:39,945 --> 01:53:41,571
Let's ask her.

1671
01:53:41,655 --> 01:53:45,617
Maybe she knows. What say there,
Fuzzy Britches? Feel like talking?

1672
01:53:46,702 --> 01:53:47,785
Ah...

1673
01:53:47,786 --> 01:53:49,245
I guess not.

1674
01:53:49,330 --> 01:53:52,206
Why should she be any different?

1675
01:53:52,291 --> 01:53:54,751
This is a conspiracy.

1676
01:53:54,835 --> 01:53:57,045
That's what this is.

1677
01:53:57,129 --> 01:53:58,671
One big...

1678
01:53:58,756 --> 01:54:01,507
damn conspiracy!

1679
01:54:01,592 --> 01:54:04,260
And everyone's in on it!

1680
01:54:04,345 --> 01:54:05,637
Including her!

1681
01:54:06,972 --> 01:54:08,640
(Clattering)

1682
01:54:32,414 --> 01:54:34,123
(Sirens blare)

1683
01:54:40,297 --> 01:54:42,173
RED: In 1966,

1684
01:54:42,257 --> 01:54:44,926
Andy Dufresne escaped

1685
01:54:45,010 --> 01:54:47,095
from Shawshank Prison.

1686
01:54:48,764 --> 01:54:51,516
All they found of him
was a muddy set of prison clothes,

1687
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:53,643
a bar of soap

1688
01:54:53,727 --> 01:54:58,106
and an old rock hammer
damn near worn down to the nub.

1689
01:55:02,486 --> 01:55:07,323
I remember thinking it would take a man
600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.

1690
01:55:07,408 --> 01:55:10,118
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1691
01:55:28,679 --> 01:55:30,763
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1692
01:55:31,807 --> 01:55:35,309
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.

1693
01:55:35,394 --> 01:55:37,687
An Ice Age here,

1694
01:55:37,771 --> 01:55:40,356
a million years of mountain-building there.

1695
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:43,818
Geology is the study of pressure and time.

1696
01:55:45,028 --> 01:55:47,071
That's all it takes, really.

1697
01:55:47,156 --> 01:55:49,198
Pressure...

1698
01:55:49,283 --> 01:55:51,159
and time.

1699
01:55:51,243 --> 01:55:54,579
That and a big goddamn poster.

1700
01:55:55,664 --> 01:55:57,707
(Coughing)

1701
01:55:57,791 --> 01:55:59,167
Like I said,

1702
01:55:59,168 --> 01:56:02,962
in prison, a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1703
01:56:05,758 --> 01:56:10,928
It turns out Andy's favorite hobby
was toting his wall out into the exercise yard.

1704
01:56:11,013 --> 01:56:13,097
A handful at a time.

1705
01:56:14,933 --> 01:56:17,101
I guess after Tommy was killed,

1706
01:56:17,186 --> 01:56:20,021
Andy decided he'd been here
just about long enough.

1707
01:56:20,105 --> 01:56:22,315
Lickety-split. I want to get home.

1708
01:56:23,609 --> 01:56:25,693
I'm just about finished, sir.

1709
01:56:47,090 --> 01:56:49,175
Three deposits tonight.

1710
01:56:56,350 --> 01:56:58,392
Andy did like he was told.

1711
01:56:59,436 --> 01:57:02,939
Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine.

1712
01:57:06,527 --> 01:57:08,569
The guard simply didn't notice.

1713
01:57:08,654 --> 01:57:10,696
Neither did I.

1714
01:57:10,781 --> 01:57:15,117
I mean, seriously, how often
do you really look at a man's shoes?

1715
01:57:49,820 --> 01:57:51,904
(Thunderclap)

1716
01:59:19,159 --> 01:59:25,331
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards
of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.

1717
01:59:25,415 --> 01:59:26,582
(Gags)

1718
01:59:26,667 --> 01:59:28,668
Or maybe I just don't want to.

1719
01:59:28,752 --> 01:59:30,836
(Coughs and spits)

1720
01:59:33,382 --> 01:59:35,591
500 yards.

1721
01:59:36,635 --> 01:59:39,136
That's the length of five football fields.

1722
01:59:40,180 --> 01:59:42,431
Just shy of half a mile.

1723
02:00:23,974 --> 02:00:25,683
(Laughs)

1724
02:00:37,654 --> 02:00:42,199
The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her little secret,

1725
02:00:42,284 --> 02:00:45,703
a man nobody ever laid eyes on before

1726
02:00:45,787 --> 02:00:48,205
strode into the Maine National Bank.

1727
02:00:48,290 --> 02:00:50,332
Until that moment,

1728
02:00:50,417 --> 02:00:52,293
he didn't exist,

1729
02:00:52,377 --> 02:00:53,711
except on paper.

1730
02:00:53,795 --> 02:00:54,837
May I help you?

1731
02:00:54,921 --> 02:00:56,964
RED: He had all the proper ID,

1732
02:00:57,049 --> 02:01:00,676
driver's license, birth certificate,
social security card.

1733
02:01:00,761 --> 02:01:04,055
And the signature was a spot-on match.

1734
02:01:04,139 --> 02:01:07,183
I must say, I'm sorry to be losing your business.

1735
02:01:07,267 --> 02:01:09,268
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1736
02:01:09,352 --> 02:01:11,145
Thank you.

1737
02:01:11,229 --> 02:01:13,022
I'm sure I will.

1738
02:01:13,106 --> 02:01:15,232
Here's your cashier's check, sir.

1739
02:01:15,317 --> 02:01:17,359
Will there be anything else?

1740
02:01:17,444 --> 02:01:18,444
Please...

1741
02:01:18,528 --> 02:01:21,614
Would you add this to your outgoing mail?

1742
02:01:21,698 --> 02:01:23,908
I'd be happy to.

1743
02:01:23,992 --> 02:01:26,327
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

1744
02:01:26,411 --> 02:01:31,207
RED: Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the Portland area that morning.

1745
02:01:32,375 --> 02:01:38,839
All told, he blew town with better than $370,000
of Warden Norton's money.

1746
02:01:38,924 --> 02:01:41,383
Severance pay for 19 years.

1747
02:01:41,468 --> 02:01:43,552
(Phone rings)

1748
02:01:49,518 --> 02:01:51,811
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1749
02:01:59,486 --> 02:02:01,570
(Sirens wail)

1750
02:02:30,767 --> 02:02:32,810
(Sirens approaching)

1751
02:02:44,531 --> 02:02:47,533
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

1752
02:02:47,617 --> 02:02:52,246
If you give up the right to remain silent, anything
you say will be held against you in court.

1753
02:02:52,330 --> 02:02:54,206
RED: I wasn't there to see it.

1754
02:02:54,291 --> 02:02:59,170
But I hear Byron Hadley started sobbing
like a little girl when they took him away.

1755
02:03:04,593 --> 02:03:07,386
Norton had no intention of going that quietly.

1756
02:03:23,361 --> 02:03:24,820
Samuel Norton?

1757
02:03:24,905 --> 02:03:28,157
- We have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.
(Banging on door)

1758
02:03:31,036 --> 02:03:32,161
Norton!

1759
02:03:32,245 --> 02:03:33,913
Open the door.

1760
02:03:33,997 --> 02:03:35,748
I'm not sure which key it is.

1761
02:03:38,627 --> 02:03:40,294
Norton!

1762
02:03:45,759 --> 02:03:47,843
Make it easy on yourself, Norton.

1763
02:03:59,147 --> 02:04:02,733
RED: I like to think
the last thing that went through his head,

1764
02:04:02,817 --> 02:04:04,526
other than that bullet,

1765
02:04:04,611 --> 02:04:08,614
was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1766
02:04:10,283 --> 02:04:11,367
Carter, James...

1767
02:04:11,451 --> 02:04:14,828
RED: Not long after the Warden
deprived us of his company,

1768
02:04:14,913 --> 02:04:17,164
I got a postcard in the mail.

1769
02:04:18,875 --> 02:04:21,293
It was blank but the postmark said...

1770
02:04:21,378 --> 02:04:24,129
Fort Hancock, Texas.

1771
02:04:24,214 --> 02:04:26,257
Fort Hancock.

1772
02:04:26,341 --> 02:04:28,384
Right on the border.

1773
02:04:28,468 --> 02:04:30,511
That's where Andy crossed.

1774
02:04:30,595 --> 02:04:34,473
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down,

1775
02:04:35,517 --> 02:04:37,601
it always makes me laugh.

1776
02:04:39,020 --> 02:04:41,063
Andy Dufresne,

1777
02:04:41,147 --> 02:04:43,524
who crawled through a river of shit

1778
02:04:43,608 --> 02:04:45,693
and came out clean on the other side.

1779
02:04:46,903 --> 02:04:48,946
Andy Dufresne,

1780
02:04:49,030 --> 02:04:50,948
headed for the Pacific.

1781
02:04:53,535 --> 02:04:55,577
Hadley's got him by the toes, right?

1782
02:04:55,662 --> 02:04:59,873
And he says, "I believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident."

1783
02:04:59,958 --> 02:05:03,127
RED: Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

1784
02:05:03,211 --> 02:05:05,462
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

1785
02:05:05,547 --> 02:05:08,048
"These friends of mine
could use a couple of beers!"

1786
02:05:08,133 --> 02:05:10,217
- And he got it.
- And he got it!

1787
02:05:11,386 --> 02:05:13,762
RED: Sometimes it makes me sad, though,

1788
02:05:13,847 --> 02:05:15,889
Andy being gone.

1789
02:05:15,974 --> 02:05:19,977
I have to remind myself
that some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1790
02:05:21,062 --> 02:05:23,147
Their feathers are just too bright.

1791
02:05:24,691 --> 02:05:26,734
And when they fly away,

1792
02:05:26,818 --> 02:05:30,738
the part of you that knows
it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1793
02:05:32,490 --> 02:05:33,949
But still...

1794
02:05:34,034 --> 02:05:38,203
the place you live in is that much more drab
and empty that they're gone.

1795
02:05:42,751 --> 02:05:45,002
I guess I just miss my friend.

1796
02:06:08,985 --> 02:06:10,861
Please sit down.

1797
02:06:16,451 --> 02:06:18,577
Ellis Boyd Redding.

1798
02:06:18,661 --> 02:06:22,039
Your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1799
02:06:22,123 --> 02:06:24,500
Do you feel you've been rehabilitated?

1800
02:06:26,628 --> 02:06:28,712
Rehabilitated?

1801
02:06:30,256 --> 02:06:32,341
Well, now, let me see.

1802
02:06:33,385 --> 02:06:35,719
You know, I don't have any idea
what that means.

1803
02:06:37,514 --> 02:06:40,057
Well, it means you're ready to rejoin society...

1804
02:06:40,141 --> 02:06:42,684
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1805
02:06:45,063 --> 02:06:47,147
To me, it's just a made-up word.

1806
02:06:48,191 --> 02:06:50,442
A politician's word so that...

1807
02:06:50,527 --> 02:06:56,031
young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie and have a job.

1808
02:06:58,451 --> 02:07:00,536
What do you really want to know?

1809
02:07:01,704 --> 02:07:03,622
Am I sorry for what I did?

1810
02:07:03,706 --> 02:07:05,416
Well, are you?

1811
02:07:07,043 --> 02:07:09,628
There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.

1812
02:07:11,214 --> 02:07:14,341
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1813
02:07:18,138 --> 02:07:20,222
I look back on the way I was then.

1814
02:07:22,809 --> 02:07:24,852
A young...

1815
02:07:24,936 --> 02:07:28,021
stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.

1816
02:07:31,860 --> 02:07:33,944
I wanna talk to him.

1817
02:07:35,321 --> 02:07:37,489
I wanna try and talk some sense to him,

1818
02:07:38,533 --> 02:07:40,617
tell him the way things are.

1819
02:07:42,787 --> 02:07:44,872
But I can't.

1820
02:07:46,082 --> 02:07:48,167
That kid's long gone.

1821
02:07:49,461 --> 02:07:51,545
This old man is all that's left.

1822
02:07:53,673 --> 02:07:55,174
I gotta live with that.

1823
02:07:56,509 --> 02:07:58,302
Rehabilitated?

1824
02:07:58,386 --> 02:08:00,387
It's just a bullshit word.

1825
02:08:00,472 --> 02:08:06,393
So you go on and stamp your form, sonny,
and stop wasting my time.

1826
02:08:07,479 --> 02:08:09,521
Because to tell you the truth,

1827
02:08:09,606 --> 02:08:12,107
I don't give a shit.

1828
02:08:50,230 --> 02:08:52,314
(Gate closes)

1829
02:09:11,709 --> 02:09:13,794
(Siren passes outside)

1830
02:09:38,319 --> 02:09:40,404
Here you go, miss.

1831
02:09:42,407 --> 02:09:43,865
Rest room break, boss?

1832
02:09:49,914 --> 02:09:54,209
You don't need to ask me every time you need
to go take a piss. Just go. Understand?

1833
02:09:55,420 --> 02:09:57,087
Yes, sir.

1834
02:10:07,140 --> 02:10:10,183
RED: 40 years
I've been asking permission to piss.

1835
02:10:11,185 --> 02:10:13,395
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1836
02:10:17,525 --> 02:10:19,610
There's a harsh truth to face.

1837
02:10:21,571 --> 02:10:23,905
No way I'm gonna make it on the outside.

1838
02:10:32,123 --> 02:10:35,584
All I do any more
is think of ways to break my parole...

1839
02:10:36,628 --> 02:10:38,712
..so maybe they'd send me back.

1840
02:10:44,218 --> 02:10:46,303
A terrible thing to live in fear.

1841
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:51,058
Brooks Hatlen knew it, knew it all too well.

1842
02:10:53,227 --> 02:10:56,021
All I want is to be back
where things make sense,

1843
02:10:57,065 --> 02:10:59,566
where I won't have to be afraid all the time.

1844
02:11:02,445 --> 02:11:04,529
Only one thing stops me.

1845
02:11:05,573 --> 02:11:07,658
A promise I made to Andy.

1846
02:11:28,388 --> 02:11:30,472
Here it is.

1847
02:11:40,274 --> 02:11:42,359
Much obliged, sir.

1848
02:15:05,605 --> 02:15:07,689
(Bird calls)

1849
02:15:21,162 --> 02:15:22,454
ANDY: Dear Red,

1850
02:15:22,538 --> 02:15:24,998
if you're reading this, you've gotten out.

1851
02:15:25,082 --> 02:15:29,336
And if you've come this far,
maybe you're willing to come a little further.

1852
02:15:29,420 --> 02:15:32,005
You remember the name of the town, don't you?

1853
02:15:34,300 --> 02:15:36,384
Zihuatanejo.

1854
02:15:37,428 --> 02:15:38,637
I could use a good man

1855
02:15:38,721 --> 02:15:40,764
to help me get my project on wheels.

1856
02:15:40,848 --> 02:15:42,974
I'll keep an eye out for you

1857
02:15:43,059 --> 02:15:45,101
and the chessboard ready.

1858
02:15:46,145 --> 02:15:47,520
Remember, Red,

1859
02:15:47,605 --> 02:15:49,648
hope is a good thing.

1860
02:15:49,732 --> 02:15:51,775
Maybe the best of things.

1861
02:15:51,859 --> 02:15:53,944
And no good thing ever dies.

1862
02:15:54,987 --> 02:15:57,447
I will be hoping that this letter finds you

1863
02:15:57,531 --> 02:15:59,574
and finds you well.

1864
02:15:59,659 --> 02:16:02,160
Your friend, Andy.

1865
02:16:36,737 --> 02:16:40,615
RED: Get busy living or get busy dying.

1866
02:16:43,119 --> 02:16:45,203
That's goddamn right.

1867
02:16:50,710 --> 02:16:52,836
For the second time in my life,

1868
02:16:52,920 --> 02:16:55,005
I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1869
02:16:56,674 --> 02:16:58,758
Parole violation.

1870
02:16:58,759 --> 02:17:02,470
Of course, I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

1871
02:17:03,723 --> 02:17:05,765
Not for an old crook like me.

1872
02:17:05,850 --> 02:17:07,934
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1873
02:17:11,647 --> 02:17:15,775
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still
or hold a thought in my head.

1874
02:17:16,819 --> 02:17:19,821
I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.

1875
02:17:19,905 --> 02:17:22,615
A free man at the start of a long journey

1876
02:17:22,700 --> 02:17:25,618
whose conclusion is uncertain.

1877
02:17:28,497 --> 02:17:30,665
I hope I can make it across the border.

1878
02:17:32,543 --> 02:17:35,336
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.

1879
02:17:37,715 --> 02:17:40,925
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

1880
02:17:43,679 --> 02:17:45,555
I hope.
