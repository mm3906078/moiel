1
00:02:05,457 --> 00:02:07,417
Mr. Dufresne, describe...

2
00:02:07,626 --> 00:02:11,964
...the confrontation you had with
your wife the night she was murdered.

3
00:02:16,635 --> 00:02:18,303
It was very bitter.

4
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:22,975
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around.

5
00:02:24,518 --> 00:02:28,021
And she said that she wanted
a divorce in Reno.

6
00:02:28,272 --> 00:02:31,900
- What was your response?
- I told her I would not grant one.

7
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:35,278
"I'll see you in hell
before I see you in Reno."

8
00:02:35,487 --> 00:02:38,824
Those were your words,
according to your neighbors.

9
00:02:39,907 --> 00:02:41,535
If they say so.

10
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:44,580
I really don't remember.
I was upset.

11
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:47,290
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

12
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,210
She packed a bag.

13
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:54,548
She packed a bag to go
and stay with Mr. Quentin.

14
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:59,260
Glenn Quentin, golf pro
at the Snowden Hills Country Club...

15
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,597
...whom you had discovered
was your wife's lover.

16
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:06,101
Did you follow her?

17
00:03:07,477 --> 00:03:09,563
I went to a few bars first.

18
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:14,150
Later, I drove to his house
to confront them. They weren't home.

19
00:03:14,692 --> 00:03:16,236
I parked in the turnout...

20
00:03:16,945 --> 00:03:17,904
...and waited.

21
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:19,780
With what intention?

22
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:21,824
I'm not sure.

23
00:03:22,993 --> 00:03:24,453
I was confused...

24
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,703
...drunk.

25
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,499
I think...

26
00:03:28,706 --> 00:03:30,793
...mostly I wanted to scare them.

27
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:34,463
When they arrived, you went up
to the house and murdered them.

28
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:36,757
I was sobering up.

29
00:03:36,964 --> 00:03:40,636
I got back in the car
and I drove home to sleep it off.

30
00:03:40,843 --> 00:03:43,806
Along the way, I threw my gun
into the Royal River.

31
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:45,974
I've been very clear on this point.

32
00:03:46,224 --> 00:03:50,312
I get hazy where the cleaning woman
shows up the following morning...

33
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,105
...and finds your wife in bed
with her lover...

34
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:55,400
...riddled with.38-caliber bullets.

35
00:03:56,776 --> 00:04:00,989
Does that strike you as a
fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

36
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:02,866
Yes, it does.

37
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:06,244
Yet you still maintain
you threw your gun into the river...

38
00:04:06,452 --> 00:04:08,496
...before the murders took place.

39
00:04:08,704 --> 00:04:10,957
That's very convenient.

40
00:04:11,165 --> 00:04:12,834
It's the truth.

41
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:17,756
The police dragged that river for
three days, and nary a gun was found...

42
00:04:17,964 --> 00:04:22,051
...so no comparison could be made
between your gun and the bullets...

43
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:25,722
...taken from the bloodstained corpses
of the victims.

44
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:28,766
And that also...

45
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:32,687
...is very convenient.
Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

46
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:36,065
Since I am innocent of this crime...

47
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:40,903
...I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

48
00:04:58,796 --> 00:05:02,175
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard
all the evidence.

49
00:05:02,383 --> 00:05:06,220
We have the accused at the scene
of the crime. We have footprints.

50
00:05:06,429 --> 00:05:09,265
Bullets on the ground
bearing his fingerprints.

51
00:05:09,474 --> 00:05:12,435
A broken bourbon bottle,
likewise with fingerprints.

52
00:05:12,643 --> 00:05:14,228
And most of all...

53
00:05:14,437 --> 00:05:17,482
...we have a beautiful young woman
and her lover...

54
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,733
...lying dead in each other's arms.

55
00:05:20,902 --> 00:05:23,529
They had sinned.

56
00:05:24,739 --> 00:05:27,240
But was their crime so great...

57
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:29,744
...as to merit a death sentence?

58
00:05:29,952 --> 00:05:32,246
While you think about that...

59
00:05:33,664 --> 00:05:35,458
...think about this:

60
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:40,086
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

61
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:43,966
I submit that this was not
a hot-blooded crime of passion.

62
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:46,969
That at least could be understood,
if not condoned.

63
00:05:47,177 --> 00:05:48,221
No.

64
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:49,555
This was revenge...

65
00:05:49,763 --> 00:05:54,185
...of a much more brutal,
cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

66
00:05:54,392 --> 00:05:56,771
Four bullets per victim.

67
00:05:57,522 --> 00:05:59,273
Not six shots fired, but eight.

68
00:05:59,774 --> 00:06:03,360
That means that he fired
the gun empty...

69
00:06:03,611 --> 00:06:05,529
...and then stopped to reload...

70
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,242
...so that he could shoot
each of them again.

71
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,993
An extra bullet per lover...

72
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:14,539
...right in the head.

73
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:22,838
You strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

74
00:06:23,256 --> 00:06:25,383
It chills my blood just to look at you.

75
00:06:27,342 --> 00:06:30,095
By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine...

76
00:06:30,304 --> 00:06:34,558
...I hereby order you to serve
two life sentences back-to-back...

77
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:37,435
...one for each of your victims.
So be it!

78
00:07:02,586 --> 00:07:03,753
Sit.

79
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:11,136
We see you've served
20 years of a life sentence?

80
00:07:12,054 --> 00:07:15,265
- Yes, sir.
- You feel you've been rehabilitated?

81
00:07:15,682 --> 00:07:18,268
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

82
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:21,396
I mean, I learned my lesson.

83
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:25,902
I can honestly say
that I'm a changed man.

84
00:07:29,154 --> 00:07:31,532
I'm no longer a danger to society.

85
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,701
That's God's honest truth.

86
00:08:09,986 --> 00:08:11,279
Hey, Red.

87
00:08:11,488 --> 00:08:12,781
How'd it go?

88
00:08:12,988 --> 00:08:15,157
Same old shit, different day.

89
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,285
Yeah, I know how you feel.

90
00:08:17,494 --> 00:08:19,495
I'm up for rejection next week.

91
00:08:20,288 --> 00:08:22,791
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

92
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:24,292
It happens.

93
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:25,961
Hey, Red, bump me a deck.

94
00:08:26,127 --> 00:08:29,422
Get out of my face, man!
You're into me for five packs already.

95
00:08:29,673 --> 00:08:30,632
Four!

96
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,220
There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.

97
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:37,222
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

98
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,517
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer,
if that's your thing...

99
00:08:40,724 --> 00:08:44,146
...bottle of brandy to celebrate
your kid's high school graduation.

100
00:08:44,354 --> 00:08:46,481
Damn near anything within reason.

101
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:50,443
Yes, sir!
I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

102
00:08:53,363 --> 00:08:56,323
So when Andy Dufresne
came to me in 1949...

103
00:08:56,491 --> 00:09:00,077
...and asked me to smuggle
Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...

104
00:09:00,287 --> 00:09:02,538
...I told him, "No problem."

105
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:46,582
Andy came to Shawshank Prison...

106
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:50,669
...in early 1947 for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

107
00:09:51,045 --> 00:09:55,090
On the outside, he'd been vice president
of a large Portland bank.

108
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:57,344
Good work for a man so young.

109
00:10:40,594 --> 00:10:42,346
You speak English, butt-steak?

110
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:44,390
You follow this officer.

111
00:10:57,154 --> 00:11:01,407
I never seen such a sorry-looking
heap of maggot shit in all my life.

112
00:11:01,657 --> 00:11:04,243
Hey, fish! Come over here!

113
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:28,933
Taking bets today, Red?

114
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,978
Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.

115
00:11:31,187 --> 00:11:32,897
Smokes. Put me down for two.

116
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:34,981
All right, who's your horse?

117
00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:36,942
That little sack of shit.

118
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:41,822
- Eighth. He'll be first.
- Bullshit! I'll take that action.

119
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:44,240
You're out some smokes, son.

120
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,202
If you're so smart, you call it.

121
00:11:46,452 --> 00:11:49,497
I'll take that chubby fat-ass there.

122
00:11:49,705 --> 00:11:52,291
The fifth one.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

123
00:11:55,502 --> 00:11:57,213
Fresh fish today!

124
00:11:58,005 --> 00:11:59,465
We're reeling them in!

125
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:03,803
I admit I didn't think much of Andy
first time I laid eyes on him.

126
00:12:04,345 --> 00:12:07,222
Looked like a stiff breeze
would blow him over.

127
00:12:07,556 --> 00:12:09,682
That was my first impression of the man.

128
00:12:09,892 --> 00:12:11,352
What do you say?

129
00:12:11,518 --> 00:12:14,814
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

130
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:17,148
That guy? Never happen.

131
00:12:17,358 --> 00:12:19,651
-10 cigarettes.
- That's a rich bet.

132
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,904
Who's going to prove me wrong?

133
00:12:22,112 --> 00:12:23,906
Heywood? Jigger?

134
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:25,491
Skeets?

135
00:12:25,698 --> 00:12:27,034
Floyd!

136
00:12:27,992 --> 00:12:30,036
Four brave souls.

137
00:12:30,246 --> 00:12:32,998
Return to your cellblocks
for evening count.

138
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:36,501
All prisoners,
return to your cellblocks.

139
00:12:56,896 --> 00:12:58,022
Turn to the right!

140
00:12:58,231 --> 00:12:59,524
Eyes front.

141
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,206
This is Mr. Hadley.
He's captain of the guards.

142
00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:17,542
I'm Mr. Norton, the warden.

143
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:19,920
You are convicted felons.

144
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:22,213
That's why they've sent you to me.

145
00:13:22,797 --> 00:13:24,215
Rule number one:

146
00:13:24,425 --> 00:13:25,884
No blasphemy.

147
00:13:26,427 --> 00:13:29,846
I'll not have the Lord's name
taken in vain in my prison.

148
00:13:30,054 --> 00:13:31,222
The other rules...

149
00:13:31,431 --> 00:13:34,726
...you'll figure out as you go along.
Any questions?

150
00:13:35,102 --> 00:13:36,186
When do we eat?

151
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:46,863
You eat when we say you eat.

152
00:13:47,113 --> 00:13:50,366
You shit when we say you shit,
and piss when we say you piss.

153
00:13:50,575 --> 00:13:53,411
You got that,
you maggot-dick motherfucker?

154
00:13:55,288 --> 00:13:56,624
On your feet.

155
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:58,583
I believe in two things:

156
00:13:58,793 --> 00:14:01,294
Discipline and the Bible.

157
00:14:01,795 --> 00:14:03,837
Here, you'll receive both.

158
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:06,758
Put your trust in the Lord.

159
00:14:07,342 --> 00:14:09,594
Your ass belongs to me.

160
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:13,348
Welcome to Shawshank.

161
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,896
Unhook them.

162
00:14:25,318 --> 00:14:26,694
Turn around.

163
00:14:33,535 --> 00:14:34,953
That's enough.

164
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,872
Move to the end of the cage.

165
00:14:38,873 --> 00:14:41,417
Turn around. Delouse him.

166
00:14:43,545 --> 00:14:44,796
Turn around.

167
00:14:47,674 --> 00:14:50,342
Move out of the cage.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

168
00:14:50,552 --> 00:14:51,886
Next man up!

169
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,640
To the right.

170
00:14:55,848 --> 00:14:56,891
Right. Right.

171
00:14:57,475 --> 00:14:58,685
Left.

172
00:14:59,102 --> 00:15:02,896
The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.

173
00:15:03,355 --> 00:15:06,484
They march you in
naked as the day you were born...

174
00:15:06,692 --> 00:15:10,488
...skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit.

175
00:15:11,155 --> 00:15:13,533
And when they put you in that cell...

176
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,076
...and those bars slam home...

177
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:18,746
...that's when you know it's for real.

178
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:22,375
Old life blown away
in the blink of an eye.

179
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:26,963
Nothing left but all the time
in the world to think about it.

180
00:15:28,046 --> 00:15:31,426
Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.

181
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,720
Somebody always breaks down crying.

182
00:15:35,221 --> 00:15:36,847
Happens every time.

183
00:15:37,765 --> 00:15:39,559
The only question is...

184
00:15:39,766 --> 00:15:41,518
...who's it going to be?

185
00:15:42,936 --> 00:15:45,899
It's as good a thing
to bet on as any, I guess.

186
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,610
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

187
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,287
Lights out!

188
00:16:20,808 --> 00:16:23,144
I remember my first night.

189
00:16:23,977 --> 00:16:26,939
Seems like a long time ago.

190
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,735
Hey, fish.

191
00:16:32,778 --> 00:16:34,572
Fish, fish.

192
00:16:36,157 --> 00:16:37,908
What are you, scared of the dark?

193
00:16:40,285 --> 00:16:42,955
Bet you wish your daddy
never dicked your mama!

194
00:16:43,163 --> 00:16:46,625
Piggy! Pork!
I want me a pork chop.

195
00:16:54,967 --> 00:16:58,178
The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.

196
00:16:58,512 --> 00:17:01,473
And they don't quit
till they reel someone in.

197
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,434
Hey, Fat Ass.

198
00:17:05,978 --> 00:17:07,271
Fat Ass!

199
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,190
Talk to me, boy.

200
00:17:11,191 --> 00:17:13,610
I know you're there.
I can hear you breathing.

201
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:16,780
Don't you listen to these nitwits,
you hear me?

202
00:17:16,989 --> 00:17:18,866
This place ain't so bad.

203
00:17:19,324 --> 00:17:20,534
Tell you what...

204
00:17:21,827 --> 00:17:24,913
...I'll introduce you around,
make you feel right at home.

205
00:17:25,497 --> 00:17:28,459
I know a couple of
big old bull queers that'd just...

206
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:30,627
...love to make your acquaintance.

207
00:17:30,836 --> 00:17:34,339
Especially that big, white,
mushy butt of yours.

208
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:35,632
God!

209
00:17:36,341 --> 00:17:37,718
I don't belong here!

210
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:40,762
- We have a winner!
- I want to go home!

211
00:17:41,012 --> 00:17:43,682
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

212
00:17:46,518 --> 00:17:48,227
Fresh fish!

213
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:56,152
I want to go home!

214
00:17:57,154 --> 00:17:58,363
I want my mother!

215
00:17:58,655 --> 00:18:00,824
I had your mother!
She wasn't that great!

216
00:18:05,204 --> 00:18:07,163
What the Christ is this horseshit?

217
00:18:07,372 --> 00:18:09,500
He blasphemed. I'll tell the warden.

218
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,084
You'll tell him
with my baton up your ass!

219
00:18:12,294 --> 00:18:13,128
Let me out!

220
00:18:13,336 --> 00:18:16,714
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

221
00:18:16,924 --> 00:18:19,927
Please! I ain't supposed to be here.

222
00:18:20,426 --> 00:18:21,512
Not me!

223
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:24,014
I won't count to three.
Not even to one.

224
00:18:24,222 --> 00:18:26,308
You shut up,
or I'll sing you a lullaby!

225
00:18:26,766 --> 00:18:29,519
Shut up, man. Shut up!

226
00:18:30,229 --> 00:18:32,897
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here.

227
00:18:33,106 --> 00:18:34,399
Open that cell.

228
00:18:34,607 --> 00:18:37,861
Me neither! They run this place
like a fucking prison!

229
00:18:45,743 --> 00:18:47,371
Son of a bitch!

230
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:54,628
Captain, take it easy!

231
00:19:17,024 --> 00:19:20,278
If I hear so much as a mouse fart
in here tonight...

232
00:19:20,486 --> 00:19:23,948
...I swear by God and Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

233
00:19:24,449 --> 00:19:26,742
Every last motherfucker in here.

234
00:19:30,163 --> 00:19:33,833
Call the trustees. Take that
tub of shit down to the infirmary.

235
00:19:48,181 --> 00:19:52,811
His first night in the joint, Dufresne
cost me two packs of cigarettes.

236
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:56,022
He never made a sound.

237
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,706
Tier 3 north, clear count!

238
00:20:14,623 --> 00:20:16,459
Tier 2 north, clear count.

239
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:19,295
Tier 3 south, clear.

240
00:20:24,175 --> 00:20:25,718
Prepare to roll out.

241
00:20:29,346 --> 00:20:30,806
Roll out!

242
00:21:24,735 --> 00:21:26,904
Are you going to eat that?

243
00:21:27,571 --> 00:21:29,865
I hadn't planned on it.

244
00:21:30,907 --> 00:21:32,159
Do you mind?

245
00:21:40,751 --> 00:21:42,127
That's nice and ripe.

246
00:21:53,889 --> 00:21:55,933
Jake says thank you.

247
00:21:56,433 --> 00:21:59,603
Fell out of his nest
over by the plate shop.

248
00:22:01,062 --> 00:22:04,399
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

249
00:22:05,902 --> 00:22:07,361
Oh, no! Here he comes.

250
00:22:10,698 --> 00:22:12,116
Morning, fellas.

251
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:14,285
Fine morning, isn't it?

252
00:22:14,618 --> 00:22:16,870
You know why it's a fine morning,
don't you?

253
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,372
Send them down.
I want them lined up...

254
00:22:19,623 --> 00:22:22,209
...just like a pretty little
chorus line.

255
00:22:23,293 --> 00:22:24,503
Look at that.

256
00:22:25,045 --> 00:22:28,215
- I can't stand this guy.
- Oh, Lord!

257
00:22:28,883 --> 00:22:31,344
Yes! Richmond, Virginia.

258
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:32,929
Smell my ass!

259
00:22:33,136 --> 00:22:35,097
After he smells mine.

260
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:39,267
That's a shame about your horse
coming in last and all.

261
00:22:39,476 --> 00:22:42,270
But I sure do love
that winning horse of mine, though.

262
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:45,023
I owe that boy a big kiss
when I see him.

263
00:22:45,649 --> 00:22:49,903
Why don't you give him some of your
cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!

264
00:22:50,153 --> 00:22:51,738
Hey, Tyrell.

265
00:22:52,072 --> 00:22:54,074
You pull infirmary duty this week?

266
00:22:54,991 --> 00:22:56,576
How's my horse doing anyway?

267
00:22:56,993 --> 00:22:58,120
Dead.

268
00:22:58,995 --> 00:23:01,164
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.

269
00:23:01,373 --> 00:23:03,583
Doc had gone home for the night.

270
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:06,336
Poor bastard lay there
till this morning.

271
00:23:06,545 --> 00:23:09,005
By then, there wasn't nothing
we could do.

272
00:23:15,345 --> 00:23:16,638
What was his name?

273
00:23:20,015 --> 00:23:21,268
What'd you say?

274
00:23:23,185 --> 00:23:25,564
I was just wondering
if anyone knew his name.

275
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,984
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

276
00:23:30,026 --> 00:23:33,154
Doesn't fucking matter
what his name was. He's dead.

277
00:23:55,218 --> 00:23:57,179
Anybody come at you yet?

278
00:23:59,347 --> 00:24:01,182
Anybody get to you yet?

279
00:24:02,851 --> 00:24:05,352
Hey, we all need friends in here.

280
00:24:05,687 --> 00:24:07,355
I could be a friend to you.

281
00:24:16,573 --> 00:24:17,948
Hard to get.

282
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:21,535
I like that.

283
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:31,713
Andy kept pretty much
to himself at first.

284
00:24:32,087 --> 00:24:34,049
I guess he had a lot on his mind...

285
00:24:34,466 --> 00:24:37,301
...trying to adapt
to life on the inside.

286
00:24:38,052 --> 00:24:41,222
Wasn't until a month went by
before he opened his mouth...

287
00:24:41,431 --> 00:24:43,808
...to say more than two words
to somebody.

288
00:24:45,018 --> 00:24:46,560
As it turned out...

289
00:24:47,062 --> 00:24:48,897
...that somebody was me.

290
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,449
I'm Andy Dufresne.

291
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,409
Wife-killing banker.

292
00:25:04,663 --> 00:25:05,996
Why'd you do it?

293
00:25:06,455 --> 00:25:08,499
I didn't, since you ask.

294
00:25:09,126 --> 00:25:10,918
You're going to fit right in.

295
00:25:11,169 --> 00:25:13,838
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

296
00:25:14,463 --> 00:25:17,676
- What you in here for?
- Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

297
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:23,264
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

298
00:25:23,472 --> 00:25:27,101
You think your shit smells
sweeter than most. Is that right?

299
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:28,769
What do you think?

300
00:25:29,145 --> 00:25:32,189
To tell you the truth,
I haven't made up my mind.

301
00:25:33,315 --> 00:25:36,110
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

302
00:25:37,111 --> 00:25:40,406
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time.

303
00:25:40,614 --> 00:25:43,159
I wonder if you might get me
a rock hammer.

304
00:25:43,868 --> 00:25:45,161
A rock hammer.

305
00:25:45,537 --> 00:25:48,205
- What is it and why?
- What do you care?

306
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:52,293
For a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask.
I'd quote a price.

307
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:54,920
But a toothbrush
is a non-lethal object, isn't it?

308
00:25:56,505 --> 00:25:57,882
Fair enough.

309
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,968
A rock hammer is about
six or seven inches long.

310
00:26:01,177 --> 00:26:03,471
- Looks like a miniature pickax.
- Pickax?

311
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,889
For rocks.

312
00:26:07,516 --> 00:26:08,726
Quartz?

313
00:26:12,687 --> 00:26:16,108
And some mica, shale...

314
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,652
...limestone.

315
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:19,987
So?

316
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,782
So I'm a rock hound.

317
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:26,327
At least I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again.

318
00:26:26,577 --> 00:26:29,705
Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy
into somebody's skull.

319
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:32,750
No, I have no enemies here.

320
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,252
No? Wait a while.

321
00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:38,464
Word gets around.

322
00:26:39,173 --> 00:26:41,634
The Sisters have taken
quite a liking to you.

323
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:44,845
Especially Bogs.

324
00:26:45,846 --> 00:26:49,266
Don't suppose it would help if I
told them I'm not homosexual.

325
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:50,893
Neither are they.

326
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,562
You have to be human first.
They don't qualify.

327
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:03,489
Bull queers take by force.
That's all they want or understand.

328
00:27:03,696 --> 00:27:07,201
If I were you, I'd grow eyes
in the back of my head.

329
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:10,203
- Thanks for the advice.
- Well, that's free.

330
00:27:10,538 --> 00:27:12,497
You understand my concern.

331
00:27:12,706 --> 00:27:15,292
If there's trouble,
I won't use the rock hammer.

332
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:20,256
Then I'd guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

333
00:27:21,131 --> 00:27:22,842
What did I miss?
What's so funny?

334
00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:25,927
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

335
00:27:27,763 --> 00:27:30,015
What's an item like this usually go for?

336
00:27:30,223 --> 00:27:32,684
Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.

337
00:27:33,227 --> 00:27:35,688
My normal markup's 20 percent.

338
00:27:35,895 --> 00:27:38,231
But this is a specialty item.

339
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:42,903
Risk goes up, price goes up.
Let's make it an even 10 bucks.

340
00:27:43,111 --> 00:27:44,446
Ten it is.

341
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:48,199
Waste of money, if you ask me.

342
00:27:48,491 --> 00:27:49,784
Why's that?

343
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:54,205
Folks around this joint
love surprise inspections.

344
00:27:55,832 --> 00:27:57,793
They find it, you're going to lose it.

345
00:27:58,001 --> 00:28:00,087
If they catch you, you don't know me.

346
00:28:00,295 --> 00:28:02,548
Mention my name, we never
do business again.

347
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:06,135
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now you got that?

348
00:28:06,968 --> 00:28:08,553
I understand.

349
00:28:09,763 --> 00:28:11,848
Thank you, Mr...

350
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:13,057
Red.

351
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:15,102
Name's Red.

352
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:18,188
Why do they call you that?

353
00:28:21,983 --> 00:28:23,943
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

354
00:28:32,161 --> 00:28:34,996
I could see why some of the boys
took him for snobby.

355
00:28:35,872 --> 00:28:38,291
He had a quiet way about him...

356
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:42,796
...a walk and a talk that just
wasn't normal around here.

357
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:44,631
He strolled...

358
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:49,010
...like a man in the park without a care
or a worry in the world.

359
00:28:49,219 --> 00:28:53,890
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

360
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,061
I think it'd be fair to say...

361
00:28:58,353 --> 00:29:00,563
...I liked Andy from the start.

362
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:05,902
Let's go! Some of us
got a schedule to keep.

363
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:11,741
Move it! Come on, move it!

364
00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:17,288
How you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

365
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,870
Andy was right.

366
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,371
I finally got the joke.

367
00:29:59,663 --> 00:30:02,041
It would take a man about 600 years...

368
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,711
...to tunnel under the wall
with one of these.

369
00:30:08,505 --> 00:30:10,924
- Book?
- Not today.

370
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:17,974
Book?

371
00:30:25,315 --> 00:30:27,484
Delivery for Dufresne.

372
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:46,752
Here's your book.

373
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:53,008
Thanks.

374
00:30:59,306 --> 00:31:02,976
We're running low on hexite.
Get on back and fetch us up some.

375
00:31:40,305 --> 00:31:41,849
This will blind you.

376
00:31:42,224 --> 00:31:44,643
Honey, hush.

377
00:31:57,197 --> 00:31:59,158
That's it. You fight!

378
00:31:59,366 --> 00:32:00,826
Better that way.

379
00:32:09,042 --> 00:32:12,171
I wish I could tell you
Andy fought the good fight...

380
00:32:12,379 --> 00:32:14,339
...and the Sisters let him be.

381
00:32:14,923 --> 00:32:16,758
I wish I could tell you that...

382
00:32:16,966 --> 00:32:19,928
...but prison is no fairy-tale world.

383
00:32:21,054 --> 00:32:23,056
He never said who did it.

384
00:32:23,265 --> 00:32:24,850
But we all knew.

385
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,191
Things went on like that for a while.

386
00:32:32,608 --> 00:32:35,110
Prison life consists of routine...

387
00:32:35,402 --> 00:32:37,362
...and then more routine.

388
00:32:39,865 --> 00:32:43,368
Every so often, Andy would show up
with fresh bruises.

389
00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:46,705
The Sisters kept at him.

390
00:32:46,914 --> 00:32:48,999
Sometimes he was able
to fight them off.

391
00:32:49,207 --> 00:32:50,667
Sometimes not.

392
00:32:51,877 --> 00:32:54,046
And that's how it went for Andy.

393
00:32:54,588 --> 00:32:56,381
That was his routine.

394
00:32:57,216 --> 00:33:00,636
I do believe those first two years
were the worst for him.

395
00:33:01,136 --> 00:33:04,514
And I also believe that
if things had gone on that way...

396
00:33:04,848 --> 00:33:07,266
...this place would have
got the best of him.

397
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,853
But then, in the spring of 1949...

398
00:33:11,063 --> 00:33:12,940
...the powers that be decided:

399
00:33:13,147 --> 00:33:16,484
The roof of the license-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

400
00:33:16,693 --> 00:33:19,905
I need a dozen volunteers
for a week's work.

401
00:33:20,614 --> 00:33:22,074
As you know...

402
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:26,370
...special detail carries with it
special privileges.

403
00:33:26,577 --> 00:33:28,956
It was outdoor detail...

404
00:33:29,372 --> 00:33:33,627
...and May is one damned fine month
to be working outdoors.

405
00:33:33,877 --> 00:33:35,212
Stay in line there.

406
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:38,589
More than a hundred men
volunteered for the job.

407
00:33:42,845 --> 00:33:45,847
Wallace E. Unger.

408
00:33:46,347 --> 00:33:48,724
Ellis Redding.

409
00:33:48,934 --> 00:33:50,477
Wouldn't you know it?

410
00:33:50,936 --> 00:33:54,230
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names called.

411
00:33:54,439 --> 00:33:56,399
Andrew Dufresne.

412
00:33:56,816 --> 00:33:59,777
It only cost us
a pack of smokes per man.

413
00:34:00,278 --> 00:34:02,738
I made my usual 20 percent, of course.

414
00:34:02,948 --> 00:34:06,410
So this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

415
00:34:06,617 --> 00:34:08,161
I say, "Yeah?"

416
00:34:08,453 --> 00:34:12,081
He says, "Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

417
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:16,169
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- I'm not. He was an asshole.

418
00:34:16,377 --> 00:34:18,588
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead.

419
00:34:18,796 --> 00:34:21,090
So this lawyer fellow says to me:

420
00:34:21,299 --> 00:34:25,428
"He died a rich man." Oil wells
and shit. Close to a million bucks.

421
00:34:26,095 --> 00:34:27,972
A million bucks?

422
00:34:28,264 --> 00:34:32,769
- Incredible how lucky some assholes get.
- You going to see any of that?

423
00:34:33,352 --> 00:34:36,148
Thirty-five thousand.
That's what he left me.

424
00:34:36,355 --> 00:34:37,523
Dollars?

425
00:34:38,274 --> 00:34:41,277
That's great! That's like
winning the sweepstakes.

426
00:34:41,611 --> 00:34:42,695
Isn't it?

427
00:34:42,904 --> 00:34:45,865
Dumb shit, what do you think
the government will do to me?

428
00:34:46,073 --> 00:34:48,451
Take a big wet bite
out of my ass is what.

429
00:34:49,202 --> 00:34:50,536
Poor Byron.

430
00:34:51,454 --> 00:34:54,624
Terrible fucking luck, huh?
Crying shame.

431
00:34:54,832 --> 00:34:57,084
Some people really got it awful.

432
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:58,711
Andy, are you nuts?

433
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,838
Keep your eyes on your mop, man!

434
00:35:01,047 --> 00:35:04,008
You'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up-

435
00:35:04,217 --> 00:35:07,011
Yeah, maybe enough to buy
a new car, and then what?

436
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,347
I got to pay tax on the car. Repair...

437
00:35:09,597 --> 00:35:13,351
...maintenance, kids pestering you
to take them for a ride all the time.

438
00:35:13,558 --> 00:35:17,230
Then if you figure your tax wrong,
you pay out of your own pocket.

439
00:35:17,438 --> 00:35:19,565
I tell you! Uncle Sam!

440
00:35:19,816 --> 00:35:23,819
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

441
00:35:26,447 --> 00:35:28,616
- Getting himself killed.
- Keep tarring.

442
00:35:28,865 --> 00:35:31,369
Some brother.
Shit!

443
00:35:36,332 --> 00:35:37,708
Mr. Hadley...

444
00:35:38,584 --> 00:35:39,961
...do you trust your wife?

445
00:35:41,586 --> 00:35:43,047
Oh, that's funny.

446
00:35:43,588 --> 00:35:46,216
You'll look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

447
00:35:46,425 --> 00:35:49,762
What I mean is, do you think
she'd go behind your back?

448
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:54,267
Step aside, Mert. This fucker's
having himself an accident.

449
00:35:54,517 --> 00:35:55,518
He'll push him off!

450
00:35:55,768 --> 00:35:57,602
If you trust her, you can keep...

451
00:35:57,854 --> 00:35:59,230
...that 35,000.

452
00:35:59,981 --> 00:36:02,483
- What did you say?
- Thirty-five thousand.

453
00:36:03,317 --> 00:36:04,360
All of it.

454
00:36:04,568 --> 00:36:07,613
- Every penny.
- You better start making sense.

455
00:36:07,822 --> 00:36:10,157
If you want to keep it,
give it to your wife.

456
00:36:10,366 --> 00:36:14,244
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

457
00:36:14,454 --> 00:36:16,830
- Bullshit. Tax-free?
- Tax-free.

458
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:18,999
IRS can't touch one cent.

459
00:36:19,416 --> 00:36:21,877
You're that smart banker
that killed his wife.

460
00:36:22,128 --> 00:36:25,464
Why should I believe you?
So I can end up in here with you?

461
00:36:25,673 --> 00:36:28,508
It's legal. Ask the IRS.
They'll say the same thing.

462
00:36:28,718 --> 00:36:32,764
I feel stupid telling you this.
I'm sure you would have investigated.

463
00:36:32,971 --> 00:36:36,641
I don't need you to tell me
where the bear shit in the buckwheat.

464
00:36:36,851 --> 00:36:40,271
Of course not. But you do need
someone to set it up for you.

465
00:36:40,479 --> 00:36:42,023
That'll cost you. A lawyer.

466
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,484
A bunch of ball-washing bastards!

467
00:36:44,942 --> 00:36:48,404
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

468
00:36:48,654 --> 00:36:50,698
You get the forms, I'll prepare them...

469
00:36:50,947 --> 00:36:52,657
...nearly free of charge.

470
00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:57,205
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my coworkers.

471
00:36:58,163 --> 00:36:59,706
"Coworkers." That's rich!

472
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,084
A man working outdoors
feels more like a man...

473
00:37:03,293 --> 00:37:06,755
...if he can have a bottle of suds.
That's only my opinion...

474
00:37:07,173 --> 00:37:08,174
...sir.

475
00:37:12,135 --> 00:37:14,054
What are you jimmies staring at?

476
00:37:14,262 --> 00:37:15,847
Let's go! Work!

477
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:27,317
And that's how it came to pass...

478
00:37:27,527 --> 00:37:30,153
...that on the second-to-last
day of the job...

479
00:37:30,362 --> 00:37:34,950
...the convict crew that tarred
the factory roof in the spring of '49...

480
00:37:35,158 --> 00:37:38,286
...wound up sitting in a row
at 10:00 in the morning...

481
00:37:38,495 --> 00:37:43,959
...drinking icy-cold beer,
courtesy of the hardest screw...

482
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:47,420
...that ever walked a turn
at Shawshank State Prison.

483
00:37:47,629 --> 00:37:50,048
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

484
00:37:51,174 --> 00:37:55,720
The colossal prick even managed
to sound magnanimous.

485
00:37:56,888 --> 00:38:01,309
We sat and drank with the sun
on our shoulders and felt like free men.

486
00:38:01,726 --> 00:38:05,147
We could have been tarring
the roof of one of our own houses.

487
00:38:05,355 --> 00:38:08,191
We were the lords of all creation.

488
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:10,318
As for Andy...

489
00:38:10,568 --> 00:38:13,196
...he spent that break
hunkered in the shade...

490
00:38:13,405 --> 00:38:15,906
...a strange little smile on his face...

491
00:38:16,158 --> 00:38:18,367
...watching us drink his beer.

492
00:38:26,459 --> 00:38:27,836
Want a cold one?

493
00:38:28,503 --> 00:38:31,423
No, thanks. I gave up drinking.

494
00:38:35,426 --> 00:38:38,472
You could argue he done it
to curry favor with the guards.

495
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,976
Or maybe make a few friends
among us cons.

496
00:38:43,727 --> 00:38:44,770
Me?

497
00:38:44,978 --> 00:38:47,773
I think he did it
just to feel normal again...

498
00:38:48,231 --> 00:38:50,441
...if only for a short while.

499
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:54,195
King me.

500
00:38:56,071 --> 00:38:58,700
- Chess. Now there's a game of kings.
- What?

501
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:00,619
Civilized. Strategic.

502
00:39:01,285 --> 00:39:04,288
And a total fucking mystery.
I hate it.

503
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,332
Let me teach you someday.

504
00:39:07,917 --> 00:39:08,877
Sure.

505
00:39:09,335 --> 00:39:11,086
We could get a board together.

506
00:39:11,296 --> 00:39:14,381
You're talking to the right man.
I can get things, right?

507
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:18,553
We might do business on a board,
and I'll carve the pieces myself.

508
00:39:18,804 --> 00:39:22,098
One side in alabaster, one in soapstone.
What do you think?

509
00:39:22,682 --> 00:39:24,100
I think it'll take years.

510
00:39:24,266 --> 00:39:26,811
Years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

511
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,979
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

512
00:39:29,189 --> 00:39:31,023
Pebbles, mostly.

513
00:39:35,361 --> 00:39:38,156
We're getting to be
kind of friends, aren't we?

514
00:39:39,032 --> 00:39:40,574
Yeah, I guess.

515
00:39:41,242 --> 00:39:42,743
Can I ask you something?

516
00:39:44,246 --> 00:39:45,664
Why'd you do it?

517
00:39:46,914 --> 00:39:48,457
I'm innocent, Red.

518
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:50,709
Just like everybody else here.

519
00:39:55,047 --> 00:39:56,590
What are you in for?

520
00:39:59,301 --> 00:40:01,470
Murder. Same as you.

521
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:02,847
Innocent?

522
00:40:05,558 --> 00:40:07,977
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

523
00:41:07,286 --> 00:41:08,788
Where's the canary?

524
00:41:08,996 --> 00:41:10,289
How did you know?

525
00:41:10,498 --> 00:41:12,791
- How did I know what?
- So you don't know.

526
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,168
Come.

527
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,756
This is where the canary is.

528
00:41:21,425 --> 00:41:24,761
Quite a surprise to hear
a woman singing in my house, eh?

529
00:41:28,265 --> 00:41:29,682
That's quite a...

530
00:41:30,601 --> 00:41:32,268
...surprise.

531
00:41:36,565 --> 00:41:37,983
Wait, wait.

532
00:41:38,526 --> 00:41:40,027
Here she comes.

533
00:41:40,277 --> 00:41:43,155
I like this part when she
does that shit with her hair.

534
00:41:43,364 --> 00:41:46,075
I know. I've seen it
three times this month.

535
00:41:46,282 --> 00:41:48,202
Gilda, are you decent?

536
00:41:49,202 --> 00:41:50,328
Me?

537
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,792
God, I love it.

538
00:41:59,964 --> 00:42:02,967
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

539
00:42:03,968 --> 00:42:07,721
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

540
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:10,057
- Rita Hayworth.
- What?

541
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:11,976
Can you get her?

542
00:42:13,394 --> 00:42:16,771
So this is Johnny Farrel.
I've heard a lot about you.

543
00:42:17,982 --> 00:42:20,276
- Take a few weeks.
- Weeks?

544
00:42:20,484 --> 00:42:24,905
I don't have her stuffed down the front
of my pants right now, sorry to say.

545
00:42:25,447 --> 00:42:26,782
But I'll get her.

546
00:42:26,991 --> 00:42:28,324
Relax.

547
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:31,494
Thanks.

548
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:53,850
- Get out!
- I got to change reels!

549
00:42:54,101 --> 00:42:56,102
I said fuck off!

550
00:43:02,233 --> 00:43:03,610
Ain't you going to scream?

551
00:43:04,945 --> 00:43:06,822
Let's get this over with.

552
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:13,913
He broke my fucking nose!

553
00:43:23,213 --> 00:43:24,464
Now...

554
00:43:24,923 --> 00:43:27,092
...I'm going to open my fly...

555
00:43:27,343 --> 00:43:30,136
...and you'll swallow
what I give you to swallow.

556
00:43:31,262 --> 00:43:33,848
Then you'll swallow Rooster's.
You broke his nose.

557
00:43:34,057 --> 00:43:36,184
He ought to have
something to show for it.

558
00:43:36,392 --> 00:43:38,269
You put it in my mouth,
you lose it.

559
00:43:38,478 --> 00:43:41,064
No, you don't understand.

560
00:43:41,397 --> 00:43:44,442
Do that and I'll put all eight inches
of this in your ear.

561
00:43:44,651 --> 00:43:48,113
All right, but you should know
that sudden, serious brain injury...

562
00:43:48,321 --> 00:43:50,240
...causes the victim to bite down hard.

563
00:43:50,448 --> 00:43:53,952
In fact, I hear the bite reflex
is so strong...

564
00:43:54,744 --> 00:43:57,205
...they have to pry
the victim's jaws open...

565
00:43:57,413 --> 00:43:58,790
...with a crowbar.

566
00:44:01,751 --> 00:44:03,293
Where do you get this shit?

567
00:44:03,503 --> 00:44:04,878
I read it.

568
00:44:06,297 --> 00:44:08,967
You know how to read,
you ignorant fuck?

569
00:44:10,635 --> 00:44:11,719
Honey!

570
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,390
You shouldn't!

571
00:44:18,101 --> 00:44:20,979
Bogs didn't put anything
in Andy's mouth.

572
00:44:21,271 --> 00:44:23,314
And neither did his friends.

573
00:44:23,731 --> 00:44:27,568
What they did do is beat him
within an inch of his life.

574
00:44:28,277 --> 00:44:30,737
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

575
00:44:31,573 --> 00:44:34,074
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

576
00:44:38,163 --> 00:44:39,705
Time's up, Bogs.

577
00:44:43,501 --> 00:44:45,169
It's your world, boss.

578
00:44:48,423 --> 00:44:51,258
Return to your cellblocks
for evening count.

579
00:44:51,426 --> 00:44:54,095
All prisoners report for lock down.

580
00:45:09,026 --> 00:45:10,069
What?

581
00:45:22,706 --> 00:45:25,251
- Where's he going?
- Grab his ankles.

582
00:45:31,049 --> 00:45:32,299
Help!

583
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:38,597
Two things never happened again
after that.

584
00:45:38,848 --> 00:45:41,975
The Sisters never
laid a finger on Andy again.

585
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:45,312
And Bogs would never walk again.

586
00:45:46,481 --> 00:45:49,984
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

587
00:45:50,192 --> 00:45:52,987
To my knowledge, he lived out
the rest of his days...

588
00:45:53,195 --> 00:45:54,988
...drinking his food through a straw.

589
00:45:55,989 --> 00:46:00,119
Andy could use a nice welcome back
when he gets out of the infirmary.

590
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:03,414
Sounds good to us.

591
00:46:03,664 --> 00:46:06,166
I figure we owe him that much
for the beer.

592
00:46:06,917 --> 00:46:09,170
The man likes to play chess.

593
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:11,588
Let's get him some rocks.

594
00:46:44,246 --> 00:46:45,456
Guys!

595
00:46:46,248 --> 00:46:47,291
I got one.

596
00:46:47,499 --> 00:46:49,001
I got one. Look!

597
00:46:50,878 --> 00:46:54,964
Heywood, that isn't soapstone!
And it ain't alabaster either.

598
00:46:55,174 --> 00:46:57,050
What are you, a fucking geologist?

599
00:46:57,259 --> 00:46:59,010
He's right. It ain't.

600
00:46:59,219 --> 00:47:02,097
- What the hell is it then?
- It's a horse apple.

601
00:47:03,055 --> 00:47:05,476
- Bullshit!
- No, horseshit.

602
00:47:05,684 --> 00:47:07,144
Petrified.

603
00:47:16,153 --> 00:47:17,361
Damn!

604
00:47:17,654 --> 00:47:21,909
Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

605
00:47:22,075 --> 00:47:24,077
And by the weekend
he was due back...

606
00:47:24,285 --> 00:47:27,998
...we had enough rocks saved up
to keep him busy till rapture.

607
00:47:28,832 --> 00:47:31,335
Also got a big shipment in that week.

608
00:47:31,585 --> 00:47:32,711
Cigarettes...

609
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,961
...chewing gum...

610
00:47:34,171 --> 00:47:35,631
...sipping whisky...

611
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:39,259
...playing cards with naked ladies
on them. You name it.

612
00:47:39,467 --> 00:47:42,179
And of course, the most important item:

613
00:47:44,056 --> 00:47:46,099
Rita Hayworth herself.

614
00:48:23,219 --> 00:48:25,472
Heads up.
They're tossing cells.

615
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,391
Heads up.
They're tossing cells!

616
00:48:29,976 --> 00:48:31,477
119.

617
00:48:33,312 --> 00:48:34,982
123.

618
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:46,285
On your feet.

619
00:48:48,911 --> 00:48:50,413
Face the wall.

620
00:49:24,572 --> 00:49:26,449
Turn around and face the warden.

621
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:35,124
Pleased to see you reading this.

622
00:49:36,459 --> 00:49:38,377
Any favorite passages?

623
00:49:39,253 --> 00:49:41,631
"Watch ye, therefore,
for ye know not...

624
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,050
...when the master
of the house cometh."

625
00:49:45,218 --> 00:49:47,386
Mark 13:35.

626
00:49:48,096 --> 00:49:49,972
I've always liked that one.

627
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:52,559
But I prefer...

628
00:49:53,059 --> 00:49:54,894
..."I am the light of the world.

629
00:49:55,394 --> 00:49:58,689
Ye that followeth me
shall have the light of life."

630
00:49:58,898 --> 00:50:01,526
John, chapter 8, verse 12.

631
00:50:01,776 --> 00:50:03,820
I hear you're good with numbers.

632
00:50:04,028 --> 00:50:05,029
How nice.

633
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:08,199
Man should have a skill.

634
00:50:10,743 --> 00:50:11,744
Explain this.

635
00:50:12,912 --> 00:50:16,999
It's called a rock blanket.
It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

636
00:50:17,416 --> 00:50:19,335
A little hobby of mine.

637
00:50:30,221 --> 00:50:31,639
It's pretty clean.

638
00:50:31,931 --> 00:50:35,016
Some contraband here,
but nothing to get in a twist over.

639
00:50:39,354 --> 00:50:41,357
I can't say I approve of this.

640
00:50:42,983 --> 00:50:44,444
But I suppose...

641
00:50:46,529 --> 00:50:48,531
...exceptions can be made.

642
00:50:58,916 --> 00:51:00,251
Lock them up!

643
00:51:03,129 --> 00:51:04,714
I almost forgot.

644
00:51:05,131 --> 00:51:07,300
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

645
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:09,968
Salvation lies within.

646
00:51:10,178 --> 00:51:11,261
Yes, sir.

647
00:51:19,811 --> 00:51:22,356
Tossing cells was just an excuse.

648
00:51:22,814 --> 00:51:24,066
Truth is...

649
00:51:24,274 --> 00:51:26,735
...Norton wanted to size Andy up.

650
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:42,751
My wife made that in church group.

651
00:51:45,421 --> 00:51:46,714
Very nice, sir.

652
00:51:48,298 --> 00:51:49,759
You enjoy working the laundry?

653
00:51:51,426 --> 00:51:53,136
No, sir. Not especially.

654
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:55,889
Perhaps we can find something more...

655
00:51:56,181 --> 00:51:58,601
...befitting a man of your education.

656
00:52:06,691 --> 00:52:08,151
Hey, Jake.
Where's Brooks?

657
00:52:10,028 --> 00:52:12,781
I thought I heard you out here.

658
00:52:13,449 --> 00:52:14,991
I've been reassigned to you.

659
00:52:15,283 --> 00:52:17,619
I know, they told me.

660
00:52:18,453 --> 00:52:20,497
Ain't that a kick in the head?

661
00:52:20,705 --> 00:52:23,041
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

662
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:24,376
Come on.

663
00:52:25,794 --> 00:52:27,546
Well, here she is.

664
00:52:27,712 --> 00:52:29,714
The Shawshank Prison Library.

665
00:52:30,382 --> 00:52:32,385
National Geographics...

666
00:52:33,301 --> 00:52:36,096
...Reader's Digest condensed books...

667
00:52:36,304 --> 00:52:37,889
...and Louis L'Amour.

668
00:52:38,473 --> 00:52:40,308
Look magazine.

669
00:52:40,642 --> 00:52:42,978
Erle Stanley Gardners.

670
00:52:43,228 --> 00:52:46,690
Every evening I load up the cart
and make my rounds.

671
00:52:46,898 --> 00:52:49,568
I enter the names
on this clipboard here.

672
00:52:50,068 --> 00:52:52,821
Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.

673
00:52:53,572 --> 00:52:56,450
- Any questions?
- How long have you been librarian?

674
00:52:57,658 --> 00:53:01,704
I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

675
00:53:02,998 --> 00:53:05,166
And have you ever had an assistant?

676
00:53:05,417 --> 00:53:07,836
No. Not much to it, really.

677
00:53:08,587 --> 00:53:09,838
Why me? Why now?

678
00:53:10,255 --> 00:53:11,590
I don't know.

679
00:53:11,757 --> 00:53:14,801
But it'd be nice to have
some company down here.

680
00:53:26,062 --> 00:53:28,356
That's him.
That's the one.

681
00:53:35,989 --> 00:53:37,157
I'm Dekins.

682
00:53:37,574 --> 00:53:39,201
I was thinking...

683
00:53:39,868 --> 00:53:43,746
...about setting up some kind of
trust fund for my kids' educations.

684
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:49,127
I see.

685
00:53:54,216 --> 00:53:57,176
Why don't we have a seat
and talk it over.

686
00:54:00,388 --> 00:54:03,350
Do you have a piece of paper
and a pencil?

687
00:54:14,694 --> 00:54:15,987
Thanks.

688
00:54:16,654 --> 00:54:17,739
So...

689
00:54:19,491 --> 00:54:21,243
Mister Dekins...

690
00:54:22,077 --> 00:54:24,161
And then Andy says, "Mr. Dekins...

691
00:54:24,371 --> 00:54:27,373
...do you want your sons
to go to Harvard or Yale?"

692
00:54:27,582 --> 00:54:28,624
He didn't say that!

693
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,461
As God as my witness!

694
00:54:31,753 --> 00:54:33,505
Dekins blinked for a second...

695
00:54:33,672 --> 00:54:36,800
...then he laughed
and actually shook Andy's hand.

696
00:54:37,259 --> 00:54:39,510
- My ass!
- Shook his hand.

697
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,680
I tell you, I near soiled myself!

698
00:54:42,847 --> 00:54:47,143
All he needed was a suit and tie
and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...

699
00:54:47,352 --> 00:54:49,937
...he'd have been
"Mr. Dufresne," if you please.

700
00:54:50,146 --> 00:54:51,772
Making a few friends?

701
00:54:53,065 --> 00:54:54,734
I wouldn't say "friends."

702
00:54:54,942 --> 00:54:58,780
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

703
00:54:58,988 --> 00:55:01,323
It's a wonderful pet to have.

704
00:55:01,533 --> 00:55:03,325
Got you out of the laundry, though.

705
00:55:03,868 --> 00:55:05,744
It might do more than that.

706
00:55:05,996 --> 00:55:08,706
How about expanding the library.
Get some new books.

707
00:55:08,874 --> 00:55:11,501
If you ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

708
00:55:13,211 --> 00:55:16,172
How do you expect to do that?
I mean...

709
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,383
...get new books in here,
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please."

710
00:55:19,842 --> 00:55:21,887
I'll ask the warden for funds.

711
00:55:22,763 --> 00:55:27,057
Six wardens have been through here
in my tenure, and I've learned...

712
00:55:27,266 --> 00:55:29,560
...one immutable, universal truth:

713
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:31,228
Not one born whose asshole...

714
00:55:31,395 --> 00:55:36,358
...wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you ask for funds.

715
00:55:37,234 --> 00:55:40,112
- The budget's stretched thin as it is.
- I see.

716
00:55:40,321 --> 00:55:43,741
Maybe I could write the state senate
and request funds from them.

717
00:55:43,949 --> 00:55:48,037
They have only three ways to spend
the taxpayers' money for prisons:

718
00:55:48,245 --> 00:55:50,706
More walls, more bars, more guards.

719
00:55:50,915 --> 00:55:53,542
I'd like to try, with permission.
A letter a week.

720
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:56,504
- They can't ignore me forever.
- Sure can.

721
00:55:56,754 --> 00:55:59,423
But you write your letters
if it makes you happy.

722
00:55:59,757 --> 00:56:02,343
I'll even mail them for you.
How's that?

723
00:56:04,011 --> 00:56:06,805
So Andy started writing
a letter a week...

724
00:56:07,014 --> 00:56:08,599
...just like he said.

725
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:15,397
And like Norton said...

726
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:17,108
...Andy got no answers.

727
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:30,203
The following April, he did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

728
00:56:31,539 --> 00:56:33,791
Year after that, he did them all...

729
00:56:34,041 --> 00:56:35,960
...including the warden's.

730
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:41,172
Year after that, they
rescheduled the intramural season...

731
00:56:41,382 --> 00:56:43,800
...to coincide with tax season.

732
00:56:45,385 --> 00:56:49,848
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

733
00:56:50,057 --> 00:56:51,392
So Moresby Prison...

734
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:53,853
...issued you a gun,
but you paid for it.

735
00:56:54,103 --> 00:56:55,813
Right. The holster too.

736
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:58,482
That's tax-deductible.
You can write that off.

737
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:01,693
Yes, sir!
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

738
00:57:02,402 --> 00:57:06,906
In fact, it got so busy at tax time,
he was allowed a staff.

739
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:09,659
Could you hand me
a stack of 1040s?

740
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:14,664
Got me out of the wood shop a month out
of the year, and that was fine by me.

741
00:57:15,916 --> 00:57:19,086
And still, he kept
sending those letters.

742
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:26,886
It's Brooks.

743
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:29,513
Watch the door.

744
00:57:29,764 --> 00:57:31,098
Please, Brooks.

745
00:57:31,348 --> 00:57:33,183
- Calm the fuck down.
- Stay back!

746
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,227
- Stay back, goddamn it!
- What's going on?

747
00:57:36,437 --> 00:57:38,980
One second he's fine,
then out come the knives.

748
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:41,024
We can talk about this, right?

749
00:57:41,274 --> 00:57:45,028
There's nothing to talk about.
I'll cut his fucking throat.

750
00:57:45,278 --> 00:57:47,030
What's he done to you?

751
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:48,866
It's what they done!

752
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:50,658
I got no choice.

753
00:57:51,117 --> 00:57:53,411
You won't hurt Heywood.
We all know that.

754
00:57:53,621 --> 00:57:56,082
- Right, Heywood?
- Sure.

755
00:57:56,331 --> 00:57:59,668
He's a friend of yours,
and Brooks is a reasonable man.

756
00:57:59,918 --> 00:58:01,003
Right, guys?

757
00:58:01,961 --> 00:58:04,506
So put the knife down.
Look at me.

758
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:06,966
Put the knife down.

759
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:11,012
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

760
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:14,057
Look at his neck. He's bleeding.

761
00:58:14,974 --> 00:58:16,435
It's the only way...

762
00:58:16,643 --> 00:58:18,686
...they'd let me stay.

763
00:58:18,978 --> 00:58:21,357
This is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

764
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:23,650
Put it, put it down.

765
00:58:32,408 --> 00:58:33,910
Take it easy.

766
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:36,162
You'll be all right.

767
00:58:37,205 --> 00:58:38,790
Him? What about me?

768
00:58:38,998 --> 00:58:41,418
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!

769
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:43,503
You've had worse from shaving.

770
00:58:43,711 --> 00:58:45,797
What did you do to set him off?

771
00:58:46,005 --> 00:58:48,258
Nothing.
I come in here to say farewell.

772
00:58:48,842 --> 00:58:51,511
Ain't you heard?
His parole's come through.

773
00:58:53,847 --> 00:58:56,641
I just don't understand
what happened in there.

774
00:58:56,850 --> 00:58:59,644
Old man's crazy as a rat
in a tin shithouse.

775
00:58:59,853 --> 00:59:01,771
That's enough out of you.

776
00:59:01,937 --> 00:59:04,690
- Heard he had you shitting your pants.
- Fuck you.

777
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:06,151
Knock it off.

778
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,570
Brooks ain't no bug.

779
00:59:12,407 --> 00:59:14,159
He's just institutionalized.

780
00:59:15,535 --> 00:59:17,454
"Institutionalized," my ass.

781
00:59:17,662 --> 00:59:21,666
The man's been in here 50 years,
Heywood, 50 years!

782
00:59:21,874 --> 00:59:23,626
This is all he knows.

783
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:26,129
In here, he's an important man...

784
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:27,422
...an educated man.

785
00:59:28,213 --> 00:59:30,133
Outside, he's nothing.

786
00:59:31,009 --> 00:59:34,512
Just a used-up con
with arthritis in both hands.

787
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,724
Probably couldn't get a library card
if he tried.

788
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:39,726
You know what I'm trying to say?

789
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:42,896
I do believe
you're talking out of your ass.

790
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:46,399
You believe whatever you want.

791
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:49,402
But I tell you these walls are funny.

792
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:52,654
First you hate them.

793
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:56,408
Then you get used to them.

794
00:59:58,328 --> 01:00:00,330
Enough time passes...

795
01:00:00,996 --> 01:00:02,999
...you get so you depend on them.

796
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,210
That's "institutionalized."

797
01:00:06,419 --> 01:00:07,712
Shit.

798
01:00:07,921 --> 01:00:10,672
- I could never get like that.
- Oh, yeah?

799
01:00:11,548 --> 01:00:14,051
Wait till you've been here
as long as Brooks.

800
01:00:14,301 --> 01:00:15,845
Goddamn right.

801
01:00:18,431 --> 01:00:20,349
They send you here for life...

802
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:23,353
...that's exactly what they take.

803
01:00:25,105 --> 01:00:27,107
Part that counts, anyway.

804
01:00:34,696 --> 01:00:37,659
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

805
01:00:38,826 --> 01:00:40,494
You go on now.

806
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:43,205
You're free.

807
01:00:44,498 --> 01:00:46,041
You're free.

808
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,728
Good luck, Brooksie.

809
01:01:44,725 --> 01:01:46,226
Dear fellas:

810
01:01:46,477 --> 01:01:50,689
I can't believe how fast things move
on the outside.

811
01:01:51,982 --> 01:01:54,651
Watch it, old-timer!
Want to get killed?

812
01:01:55,903 --> 01:01:59,406
I saw an automobile once
when I was a kid...

813
01:02:00,032 --> 01:02:02,451
...but now they're everywhere.

814
01:02:06,121 --> 01:02:10,459
The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

815
01:02:26,265 --> 01:02:30,019
The parole board
got me into this halfway house...

816
01:02:30,311 --> 01:02:31,980
...called "The Brewer"...

817
01:02:32,188 --> 01:02:33,357
...and a job...

818
01:02:33,565 --> 01:02:36,526
...bagging groceries at the Food-Way.

819
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:40,489
It's hard work and I try to keep up...

820
01:02:40,696 --> 01:02:43,075
...but my hands hurt most of the time.

821
01:02:43,367 --> 01:02:45,326
Make sure your man double-bags.

822
01:02:45,536 --> 01:02:47,579
Last time, the bottom near came out.

823
01:02:48,247 --> 01:02:51,166
Make sure you double-bag
like the lady says. Understand?

824
01:02:51,374 --> 01:02:52,751
Yes, sir. Surely will.

825
01:02:52,959 --> 01:02:56,462
I don't think the store manager
likes me very much.

826
01:02:59,508 --> 01:03:03,803
Sometimes after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

827
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:05,722
I keep thinking...

828
01:03:05,972 --> 01:03:09,308
...Jake might just show up
and say hello.

829
01:03:09,892 --> 01:03:11,894
But he never does.

830
01:03:13,105 --> 01:03:17,984
I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay
and making new friends.

831
01:03:21,571 --> 01:03:24,323
I have trouble sleeping at night.

832
01:03:24,615 --> 01:03:27,870
I have bad dreams like I'm falling.

833
01:03:28,162 --> 01:03:30,371
I wake up scared.

834
01:03:30,581 --> 01:03:34,834
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

835
01:03:36,335 --> 01:03:41,215
Maybe I should get a gun and rob
the Food-Way so they'd send me home.

836
01:03:41,549 --> 01:03:45,887
I could shoot the manager while
I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.

837
01:03:47,555 --> 01:03:51,517
I guess I'm too old
for that sort of nonsense anymore.

838
01:03:51,768 --> 01:03:53,519
I don't like it here.

839
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:57,690
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.
I've decided...

840
01:03:58,566 --> 01:04:00,193
...not to stay.

841
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:13,706
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...

842
01:04:13,915 --> 01:04:17,376
...not for an old crook like me.

843
01:05:19,856 --> 01:05:24,151
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss,
not for an old crook like me.

844
01:05:25,152 --> 01:05:28,990
P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry
I put a knife to his throat.

845
01:05:29,197 --> 01:05:31,534
No hard feelings. Brooks."

846
01:05:42,003 --> 01:05:44,005
He should have died in here.

847
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:50,928
What the fuck have you done?

848
01:05:51,136 --> 01:05:53,806
It's a goddamn mess,
I'll tell you that.

849
01:05:59,352 --> 01:06:03,065
- What's all this?
- You tell me. They're addressed to you.

850
01:06:04,358 --> 01:06:05,693
Take it.

851
01:06:14,202 --> 01:06:15,702
"Dear Mr. Dufresne:

852
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:18,831
In response to your inquiries...

853
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:23,294
...the state has allocated the enclosed
funds for your library project."

854
01:06:24,044 --> 01:06:25,880
This is $200.

855
01:06:26,088 --> 01:06:30,093
"In addition, the library district
has generously responded...

856
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,845
...with a donation of used books
and sundries.

857
01:06:33,053 --> 01:06:37,182
We trust this will fill your needs.
We now consider the matter closed.

858
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:39,226
Please stop sending us letters."

859
01:06:39,434 --> 01:06:42,104
Clear all this out
before the warden gets back.

860
01:06:42,355 --> 01:06:43,523
Yes, sir.

861
01:06:47,776 --> 01:06:48,944
Good for you, Andy.

862
01:06:51,906 --> 01:06:53,032
Wow!

863
01:06:54,241 --> 01:06:56,202
It only took six years.

864
01:06:57,744 --> 01:07:00,497
From now on, I'll write two
letters a week instead of one.

865
01:07:00,706 --> 01:07:04,042
I believe you're crazy enough.
Get this stuff out...

866
01:07:04,293 --> 01:07:05,127
...like he said.

867
01:07:05,336 --> 01:07:06,754
I've got to pinch a loaf.

868
01:07:06,921 --> 01:07:08,422
When I come back...

869
01:07:08,588 --> 01:07:10,383
...this is all gone, all right?

870
01:07:59,139 --> 01:08:00,515
Do you hear that?

871
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:10,418
Dufresne!

872
01:09:12,963 --> 01:09:14,506
Andy, let me out!

873
01:09:21,387 --> 01:09:26,308
I have no idea to this day what those
two Italian ladies were singing about.

874
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,854
Truth is, I don't want to know.

875
01:09:29,061 --> 01:09:31,522
Some things are best left unsaid.

876
01:09:35,109 --> 01:09:37,862
I like to think it was something
so beautiful...

877
01:09:38,071 --> 01:09:40,197
...it can't be expressed in words...

878
01:09:40,406 --> 01:09:43,285
...and makes your heart ache
because of it.

879
01:09:44,952 --> 01:09:47,456
I tell you, those voices soared...

880
01:09:47,748 --> 01:09:52,042
...higher and farther than anybody
in a gray place dares to dream.

881
01:09:52,251 --> 01:09:55,588
It was like a beautiful bird
flapped into our drab cage...

882
01:09:55,796 --> 01:09:58,592
...and made those walls dissolve away.

883
01:09:59,009 --> 01:10:01,218
And for the briefest of moments...

884
01:10:01,427 --> 01:10:04,388
...every last man at Shawshank
felt free.

885
01:10:06,974 --> 01:10:09,643
It pissed the warden off
something awful.

886
01:10:10,936 --> 01:10:11,937
Open the door.

887
01:10:14,857 --> 01:10:16,609
Open it up!

888
01:10:17,943 --> 01:10:20,654
Dufresne, open this door!

889
01:10:21,989 --> 01:10:23,199
Turn that off!

890
01:10:30,289 --> 01:10:32,708
I am warning you. Turn that off!

891
01:10:50,476 --> 01:10:51,977
You're mine now.

892
01:10:59,443 --> 01:11:02,655
Andy got two weeks in the hole
for that little stunt.

893
01:11:02,863 --> 01:11:04,447
On your feet.

894
01:11:05,658 --> 01:11:08,035
- Hey, look who's here.
- Maestro!

895
01:11:09,829 --> 01:11:13,457
You couldn't play something good, huh?
Like Hank Williams?

896
01:11:13,832 --> 01:11:16,627
They broke the door down
before I could take requests.

897
01:11:16,836 --> 01:11:19,964
- Was it worth two weeks?
- Easiest time I ever did.

898
01:11:20,171 --> 01:11:24,343
- No such thing as easy time in the hole.
- A week in the hole is like a year.

899
01:11:24,552 --> 01:11:27,846
- Damn straight.
- I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

900
01:11:28,055 --> 01:11:31,015
So they let you tote
that record player down there, huh?

901
01:11:33,476 --> 01:11:34,854
It was in here.

902
01:11:35,688 --> 01:11:36,897
In here.

903
01:11:38,023 --> 01:11:40,151
That's the beauty of music. They...

904
01:11:40,359 --> 01:11:42,695
...can't get that from you.

905
01:11:46,197 --> 01:11:48,576
Haven't you ever felt
that way about music?

906
01:11:50,368 --> 01:11:53,497
Well, I played a mean harmonica
as a younger man.

907
01:11:54,539 --> 01:11:56,250
Lost interest in it, though.

908
01:11:56,458 --> 01:11:58,042
Didn't make much sense in here.

909
01:11:58,377 --> 01:12:00,379
Here's where it makes the most sense.

910
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,007
You need it so you don't forget.

911
01:12:03,548 --> 01:12:04,759
Forget?

912
01:12:05,133 --> 01:12:08,220
Forget that there are...

913
01:12:08,428 --> 01:12:09,888
...places...

914
01:12:10,389 --> 01:12:14,225
...in the world
that aren't made out of stone.

915
01:12:15,226 --> 01:12:16,686
There's something...

916
01:12:17,061 --> 01:12:18,439
...inside...

917
01:12:18,731 --> 01:12:20,690
...that they can't get to...

918
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:22,234
...that they can't touch.

919
01:12:22,777 --> 01:12:24,236
That's yours.

920
01:12:25,737 --> 01:12:27,363
What are you talking about?

921
01:12:28,407 --> 01:12:29,617
Hope.

922
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,036
Hope.

923
01:12:33,953 --> 01:12:35,956
Let me tell you something, my friend.

924
01:12:36,748 --> 01:12:39,084
Hope is a dangerous thing.

925
01:12:40,252 --> 01:12:42,588
Hope can drive a man insane.

926
01:12:43,297 --> 01:12:45,423
It's got no use on the inside.

927
01:12:45,633 --> 01:12:47,842
You'd better get used to that idea.

928
01:12:50,345 --> 01:12:51,847
Like Brooks did?

929
01:13:17,205 --> 01:13:18,206
Sit down.

930
01:13:23,545 --> 01:13:26,840
Says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

931
01:13:28,007 --> 01:13:30,093
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

932
01:13:30,301 --> 01:13:31,511
Oh, yes, sir.

933
01:13:32,804 --> 01:13:34,139
Without a doubt.

934
01:13:35,307 --> 01:13:37,684
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

935
01:13:39,686 --> 01:13:41,646
No danger to society here.

936
01:13:42,147 --> 01:13:43,689
God's honest truth.

937
01:13:46,276 --> 01:13:48,361
Absolutely rehabilitated.

938
01:13:58,371 --> 01:13:59,706
Thirty years.

939
01:14:01,666 --> 01:14:03,585
Jesus, when you say it like that...

940
01:14:04,419 --> 01:14:06,254
You wonder where it went.

941
01:14:08,672 --> 01:14:10,841
I wonder where 10 years went.

942
01:14:15,805 --> 01:14:16,848
Here.

943
01:14:17,265 --> 01:14:20,018
A little parole rejection present.

944
01:14:21,269 --> 01:14:22,978
Go ahead and open it.

945
01:14:24,105 --> 01:14:26,107
Went through one of your competitors.

946
01:14:26,315 --> 01:14:29,444
I hope you don't mind.
I wanted it to be a surprise.

947
01:14:39,496 --> 01:14:40,997
It's very pretty.

948
01:14:42,707 --> 01:14:43,916
Thank you.

949
01:14:46,461 --> 01:14:47,961
You going to play it?

950
01:14:52,509 --> 01:14:53,759
No.

951
01:14:57,388 --> 01:14:58,806
Not right now.

952
01:15:16,491 --> 01:15:17,574
Roll in!

953
01:15:53,778 --> 01:15:54,987
Lights out!

954
01:16:29,605 --> 01:16:31,732
Andy was as good as his word.

955
01:16:32,107 --> 01:16:34,902
He wrote two letters a week
instead of one.

956
01:16:36,946 --> 01:16:41,033
In 1959, the state senate
finally clued in to the fact...

957
01:16:41,284 --> 01:16:44,411
...they couldn't buy him off
with just a $200 check.

958
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:48,916
Appropriations Committee
voted an annual payment of $500...

959
01:16:49,124 --> 01:16:51,043
...just to shut him up.

960
01:16:51,251 --> 01:16:54,213
And you'd be amazed how far
Andy could stretch it.

961
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:57,382
He made deals with book clubs,
charity groups.

962
01:16:57,591 --> 01:17:00,343
He bought remaindered books
by the pound...

963
01:17:00,844 --> 01:17:02,387
Treasure Island.

964
01:17:02,930 --> 01:17:04,264
Robert Louis-

965
01:17:04,431 --> 01:17:05,474
Stevenson.

966
01:17:05,681 --> 01:17:07,059
Fiction, adventure.

967
01:17:09,603 --> 01:17:10,646
What's next?

968
01:17:10,854 --> 01:17:13,899
I got here Auto Repair...

969
01:17:14,649 --> 01:17:15,817
...and Soap Carving.

970
01:17:16,026 --> 01:17:19,238
Trade skills and hobbies.
Under "Educational," behind you.

971
01:17:19,446 --> 01:17:21,323
Count of Monte Crisco.

972
01:17:21,782 --> 01:17:24,118
That's "Cristo," you dumb shit.

973
01:17:25,201 --> 01:17:26,202
By Alexandree...

974
01:17:26,662 --> 01:17:27,913
...Dum-ass.

975
01:17:28,288 --> 01:17:29,289
Dumb ass.

976
01:17:31,625 --> 01:17:32,668
Dumb ass?

977
01:17:35,586 --> 01:17:37,548
Dumas. Know what that's about?

978
01:17:39,799 --> 01:17:41,801
You'd like it.
It's about a prison break.

979
01:17:41,968 --> 01:17:45,889
We ought to file that
under "Educational" too, oughtn't we?

980
01:17:46,765 --> 01:17:50,853
The rest of us did our best
to pitch in when and where we could.

981
01:17:51,437 --> 01:17:53,187
By the year Kennedy was shot...

982
01:17:53,439 --> 01:17:57,943
...Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of turpentine...

983
01:17:58,235 --> 01:18:01,320
...into the best prison library
in New England...

984
01:18:02,029 --> 01:18:04,992
...complete with a fine selection
of Hank Williams.

985
01:18:12,332 --> 01:18:14,292
That was also when Warden Norton...

986
01:18:14,501 --> 01:18:17,421
...instituted his famous
"Inside Out" program.

987
01:18:17,879 --> 01:18:19,964
You may remember reading about it.

988
01:18:20,174 --> 01:18:23,302
It made the papers
and got his picture in Look magazine.

989
01:18:23,509 --> 01:18:24,803
It's no free ride...

990
01:18:25,011 --> 01:18:28,223
.. but rather a genuine
progressive advance...

991
01:18:28,431 --> 01:18:30,933
...in corrections and rehabilitation.

992
01:18:31,268 --> 01:18:33,811
Our inmates, properly supervised...

993
01:18:34,021 --> 01:18:36,647
...will be put to work
outside these walls...

994
01:18:36,856 --> 01:18:40,401
...performing all manner
of public service.

995
01:18:40,693 --> 01:18:42,904
These men can learn the value...

996
01:18:43,113 --> 01:18:46,908
...of an honest day's labor and
provide a service to the community...

997
01:18:47,116 --> 01:18:51,829
...at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.

998
01:18:52,246 --> 01:18:54,582
Of course he didn't tell the press...

999
01:18:54,791 --> 01:18:58,252
...that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.

1000
01:18:58,461 --> 01:19:01,506
There are 100 different ways
to skim off the top.

1001
01:19:01,714 --> 01:19:04,175
Men, materials, you name it.

1002
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:07,428
And oh, my Lord,
how the money rolled in!

1003
01:19:07,637 --> 01:19:10,181
At this rate,
you'll put me out of business.

1004
01:19:10,389 --> 01:19:14,811
With this pool of slave labor,
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1005
01:19:15,394 --> 01:19:18,357
We're providing
a valuable community service.

1006
01:19:18,564 --> 01:19:22,193
That's fine for the papers,
but I've got a family to feed.

1007
01:19:24,904 --> 01:19:26,406
We go back a long way.

1008
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:32,663
I need this highway contract. I don't
get it and I go under. That's a fact.

1009
01:19:33,579 --> 01:19:35,373
You have some of this fine pie...

1010
01:19:35,581 --> 01:19:38,918
...my missus made for you.
You think about that.

1011
01:19:47,218 --> 01:19:49,887
I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

1012
01:19:50,137 --> 01:19:53,224
I already got my boys
committed elsewhere.

1013
01:19:55,184 --> 01:19:58,228
You be sure and thank Maisie
for this fine pie.

1014
01:19:59,355 --> 01:20:01,524
And behind every shady deal...

1015
01:20:01,858 --> 01:20:04,485
...behind every dollar earned...

1016
01:20:04,777 --> 01:20:07,822
...there was Andy, keeping the books.

1017
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:09,489
Two deposits.

1018
01:20:09,741 --> 01:20:13,870
Maine National and New England First.
Night drops as always, sir.

1019
01:20:44,067 --> 01:20:48,404
Get my stuff to the laundry. Two suits
for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.

1020
01:20:48,863 --> 01:20:52,407
If they over-starch my shirts again,
they'll hear from me.

1021
01:20:52,617 --> 01:20:53,950
How do I look?

1022
01:20:54,993 --> 01:20:57,454
- Very nice.
- Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1023
01:20:57,663 --> 01:20:59,206
Governor will be there.

1024
01:21:00,624 --> 01:21:02,084
You want the rest of this?

1025
01:21:03,419 --> 01:21:05,338
Woman can't bake worth shit.

1026
01:21:06,589 --> 01:21:07,924
Thank you, sir.

1027
01:21:10,759 --> 01:21:13,971
He's got his fingers
in a lot of pies, from what I hear.

1028
01:21:14,179 --> 01:21:19,018
He's got scams you haven't even
dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1029
01:21:19,226 --> 01:21:21,603
A river of dirty money
running through here.

1030
01:21:21,813 --> 01:21:25,649
Sooner or later, he'll have to
explain where it came from.

1031
01:21:25,858 --> 01:21:27,609
That's where I come in.

1032
01:21:28,193 --> 01:21:30,529
I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.

1033
01:21:30,695 --> 01:21:33,532
Stocks, securities,
tax-free municipals.

1034
01:21:33,865 --> 01:21:37,412
I send it out into the real world,
and when it comes back...

1035
01:21:37,619 --> 01:21:40,581
- Clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh?
- Cleaner.

1036
01:21:41,206 --> 01:21:44,793
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1037
01:21:47,129 --> 01:21:51,466
If they ever catch on, he'll wind up
in here wearing a number himself.

1038
01:21:51,716 --> 01:21:54,429
I thought you had
more faith in me than that.

1039
01:21:54,636 --> 01:21:57,681
I know you're good,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1040
01:21:57,890 --> 01:22:01,268
Now anybody gets curious,
FBI, IRS...

1041
01:22:01,476 --> 01:22:02,477
...whatever.

1042
01:22:02,894 --> 01:22:04,229
It'll lead to somebody.

1043
01:22:04,397 --> 01:22:08,275
Sure it is, but not to me,
and certainly not to the warden.

1044
01:22:12,654 --> 01:22:13,655
All right, who?

1045
01:22:13,864 --> 01:22:15,449
Randall Stevens.

1046
01:22:15,991 --> 01:22:16,908
Who?

1047
01:22:17,118 --> 01:22:19,119
The "silent" silent partner.

1048
01:22:19,327 --> 01:22:22,372
He's the guilty one,
the man with the bank accounts.

1049
01:22:22,581 --> 01:22:24,750
It's where the filtering
process starts.

1050
01:22:24,958 --> 01:22:27,836
They trace anything,
it'll just lead to him.

1051
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:29,672
But who is he?

1052
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:33,842
He's a phantom, an apparition.
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1053
01:22:34,926 --> 01:22:36,094
I conjured him...

1054
01:22:36,303 --> 01:22:37,679
...out of thin air.

1055
01:22:38,472 --> 01:22:41,224
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1056
01:22:44,269 --> 01:22:46,646
You can't just make a person up.

1057
01:22:46,855 --> 01:22:49,941
Sure you can,
if you know how the system works.

1058
01:22:50,442 --> 01:22:53,278
It's amazing what you
can accomplish by mail.

1059
01:22:53,612 --> 01:22:56,239
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate...

1060
01:22:56,448 --> 01:22:58,575
...driver's license, Social Security.

1061
01:22:58,867 --> 01:22:59,867
You're shitting me.

1062
01:23:00,077 --> 01:23:03,455
If they trace any accounts,
they'll wind up chasing...

1063
01:23:03,621 --> 01:23:05,373
...a figment of my imagination.

1064
01:23:05,582 --> 01:23:07,584
Well, I'll be damned!

1065
01:23:08,919 --> 01:23:10,629
Did I say you were good?

1066
01:23:11,004 --> 01:23:12,631
Shit, you are Rembrandt.

1067
01:23:13,381 --> 01:23:15,092
The funny thing is...

1068
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:19,429
...on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

1069
01:23:19,804 --> 01:23:22,140
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1070
01:23:31,024 --> 01:23:32,317
Ever bother you?

1071
01:23:33,777 --> 01:23:36,821
I don't run the scams.
I just process the profits.

1072
01:23:37,113 --> 01:23:39,116
A fine line, maybe...

1073
01:23:39,658 --> 01:23:41,742
...but I also built that library...

1074
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:44,954
...and used it to help guys
get their high school diploma.

1075
01:23:45,163 --> 01:23:47,416
Why do you think
he lets me do all that?

1076
01:23:47,624 --> 01:23:49,793
Keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1077
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,503
Money instead of sheets.

1078
01:23:51,836 --> 01:23:54,463
Well, I work cheap.
That's the tradeoff.

1079
01:24:11,690 --> 01:24:14,317
Tommy Williams
came to Shawshank in 1965...

1080
01:24:14,567 --> 01:24:16,819
...on a two-year stretch for B and E.

1081
01:24:17,027 --> 01:24:19,364
That's breaking and entering to you.

1082
01:24:19,656 --> 01:24:23,869
Cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.

1083
01:24:24,326 --> 01:24:25,619
Young punk.

1084
01:24:25,828 --> 01:24:27,456
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll...

1085
01:24:27,663 --> 01:24:29,165
...cocky as hell.

1086
01:24:29,374 --> 01:24:31,793
Come on, old boys.
Moving like molasses!

1087
01:24:32,042 --> 01:24:33,795
Making me look bad.

1088
01:24:34,003 --> 01:24:35,796
We liked him immediately.

1089
01:24:36,046 --> 01:24:39,760
I'm backing out the door
and I got the TV like this.

1090
01:24:40,051 --> 01:24:43,679
A big old thing. I couldn't see shit.
Then I hear this voice.

1091
01:24:44,347 --> 01:24:46,307
"Freeze, kid, hands in the air."

1092
01:24:46,516 --> 01:24:50,978
I was standing there, holding onto
that TV. Finally the voice says:

1093
01:24:51,187 --> 01:24:54,982
"You hear what I said, boy?"
I say, "Yes, sir. I did.

1094
01:24:55,192 --> 01:24:58,653
But if I drop this, you get me
on destruction of property too."

1095
01:25:03,115 --> 01:25:05,409
You done some stretch
in Cashman, right?

1096
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:09,872
Yeah, that was an easy piece of time,
let me tell you.

1097
01:25:10,164 --> 01:25:12,083
Weekend furloughs.
Work programs.

1098
01:25:12,291 --> 01:25:13,375
Not like here.

1099
01:25:13,584 --> 01:25:16,004
Sounds like you done time all over.

1100
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:18,839
I've been in and out since I was 13.

1101
01:25:19,048 --> 01:25:21,217
Name it, chances are I've been there.

1102
01:25:21,425 --> 01:25:24,096
Perhaps you should try a new profession.

1103
01:25:25,554 --> 01:25:27,098
What I mean is...

1104
01:25:27,431 --> 01:25:30,893
...you're not a very good thief.
You should try something else.

1105
01:25:31,102 --> 01:25:34,355
Yeah, what the hell
you know about it, Capone?

1106
01:25:34,772 --> 01:25:36,357
What are you in for?

1107
01:25:36,607 --> 01:25:37,608
Me?

1108
01:25:40,069 --> 01:25:41,737
A lawyer fucked me.

1109
01:25:45,616 --> 01:25:48,619
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

1110
01:25:56,502 --> 01:26:00,922
As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.

1111
01:26:01,465 --> 01:26:03,592
Maybe he thought of them
on the streets...

1112
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:06,303
...or his child growing up
not knowing her daddy.

1113
01:26:06,637 --> 01:26:07,972
Whatever it was...

1114
01:26:08,305 --> 01:26:10,766
...something lit a fire
under that boy's ass.

1115
01:26:14,603 --> 01:26:17,481
Thought I might try for
my high school equivalency.

1116
01:26:17,648 --> 01:26:20,192
Hear you helped
a couple of fellas with that.

1117
01:26:21,527 --> 01:26:23,779
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.

1118
01:26:25,156 --> 01:26:27,657
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1119
01:26:29,410 --> 01:26:31,244
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

1120
01:26:32,913 --> 01:26:34,331
You really mean that?

1121
01:26:35,374 --> 01:26:36,750
Yes, sir, I do.

1122
01:26:36,959 --> 01:26:38,918
Good. Because if we do this...

1123
01:26:39,128 --> 01:26:43,089
...we do it all the way,
a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.

1124
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:45,133
Thing is, see...

1125
01:26:46,385 --> 01:26:47,928
...I don't read so good.

1126
01:26:49,096 --> 01:26:50,180
"Well."

1127
01:26:52,182 --> 01:26:53,933
You don't read...

1128
01:26:54,185 --> 01:26:55,685
...so well.

1129
01:26:58,022 --> 01:26:59,523
We'll get to that.

1130
01:27:03,986 --> 01:27:06,113
So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1131
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:08,948
Started walking him through his ABC's.

1132
01:27:11,077 --> 01:27:13,286
Tommy took to it pretty well too.

1133
01:27:13,536 --> 01:27:16,331
Boy found brains he never knew he had.

1134
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:22,087
Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.

1135
01:27:22,296 --> 01:27:23,963
He really liked the kid.

1136
01:27:24,173 --> 01:27:27,717
Gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.

1137
01:27:28,219 --> 01:27:30,512
But that wasn't the only reason.

1138
01:27:31,221 --> 01:27:33,389
Prison time is slow time.

1139
01:27:33,891 --> 01:27:36,477
So you do what you can to keep going.

1140
01:27:36,810 --> 01:27:38,853
Some fellas collect stamps.

1141
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:41,731
Others build matchstick houses.

1142
01:27:42,357 --> 01:27:45,026
Andy built a library.

1143
01:27:45,527 --> 01:27:47,446
Now he needed a new project.

1144
01:27:48,322 --> 01:27:49,823
Tommy was it.

1145
01:27:50,448 --> 01:27:54,452
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

1146
01:27:54,994 --> 01:27:58,206
The same reason he hung
his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1147
01:27:59,124 --> 01:28:00,375
In prison...

1148
01:28:00,667 --> 01:28:04,379
...a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1149
01:28:05,171 --> 01:28:10,051
By 1966, right about the time Tommy
was getting ready to take his exams...

1150
01:28:10,261 --> 01:28:12,470
...it was lovely Raquel.

1151
01:28:29,028 --> 01:28:30,029
Time.

1152
01:28:36,077 --> 01:28:37,078
Well?

1153
01:28:38,663 --> 01:28:40,790
Well, it's for shit.

1154
01:28:41,291 --> 01:28:44,127
I wasted a whole year
of my time with this bullshit.

1155
01:28:44,335 --> 01:28:45,837
It's probably not that bad.

1156
01:28:46,045 --> 01:28:50,258
I didn't get a thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1157
01:28:50,467 --> 01:28:52,218
Let's see how the score comes out.

1158
01:28:52,427 --> 01:28:55,388
I'll tell you
how the goddamn score comes out.

1159
01:28:57,307 --> 01:28:58,683
Two points, right there!

1160
01:28:58,892 --> 01:29:00,435
There's your goddamn score!

1161
01:29:00,684 --> 01:29:04,397
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5 times 5 is 25...

1162
01:29:05,315 --> 01:29:06,941
Fuck this place!

1163
01:29:07,191 --> 01:29:08,318
Fuck it!

1164
01:29:27,504 --> 01:29:28,755
I feel bad.

1165
01:29:28,963 --> 01:29:30,130
I let him down.

1166
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:32,092
That's crap, kid.

1167
01:29:32,299 --> 01:29:33,634
He's proud of you.

1168
01:29:33,968 --> 01:29:36,846
We're old friends,
I know him as good as anybody.

1169
01:29:37,013 --> 01:29:38,598
Smart fellow, ain't he?

1170
01:29:38,806 --> 01:29:41,935
Smart as they come.
He was a banker on the outside.

1171
01:29:42,142 --> 01:29:44,354
What's he in here for anyway?

1172
01:29:44,687 --> 01:29:45,688
Murder.

1173
01:29:47,148 --> 01:29:48,525
The hell, you say.

1174
01:29:50,651 --> 01:29:52,986
You wouldn't think it
to look at the guy.

1175
01:29:54,197 --> 01:29:58,325
Caught his wife in bed
with some golf pro. Greased them both.

1176
01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:07,335
What?

1177
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:11,214
About four years ago...

1178
01:30:11,506 --> 01:30:14,717
...I was in Thomaston
on a two-to-three stretch.

1179
01:30:15,217 --> 01:30:16,553
I stole a car.

1180
01:30:16,886 --> 01:30:18,888
It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1181
01:30:19,555 --> 01:30:21,808
About six months left to go...

1182
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:24,017
...I get a new cellmate in.

1183
01:30:24,727 --> 01:30:26,353
Elmo Blatch.

1184
01:30:27,062 --> 01:30:28,397
Big, twitchy fucker.

1185
01:30:29,231 --> 01:30:32,735
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.
You know what I'm saying?

1186
01:30:32,943 --> 01:30:35,696
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1187
01:30:35,947 --> 01:30:38,198
Said he pulled hundreds of jobs.

1188
01:30:38,408 --> 01:30:43,370
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.
You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.

1189
01:30:44,413 --> 01:30:49,042
Talked all the time too. That's
the other thing. He never shut up.

1190
01:30:49,251 --> 01:30:50,878
Places he'd been in...

1191
01:30:51,211 --> 01:30:54,256
...jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.

1192
01:30:54,506 --> 01:30:56,717
Even people he killed.

1193
01:30:57,926 --> 01:31:00,763
People who "gave him shit."

1194
01:31:01,388 --> 01:31:02,931
That's how he put it.

1195
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:07,603
So one night, like a joke...

1196
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:12,232
...I say to him,
"Elmo, who did you kill?"

1197
01:31:12,441 --> 01:31:13,567
So he says:

1198
01:31:13,777 --> 01:31:17,738
I got me this job one time,
busing tables at a country club...

1199
01:31:18,406 --> 01:31:22,284
...so I could case all these big
rich pricks that come in.

1200
01:31:24,411 --> 01:31:26,413
So I pick out this guy...

1201
01:31:27,289 --> 01:31:28,874
...go in one night...

1202
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:30,793
...and do his place.

1203
01:31:32,252 --> 01:31:33,587
He wakes up...

1204
01:31:34,297 --> 01:31:36,090
...and gives me shit.

1205
01:31:37,132 --> 01:31:38,801
So I killed him.

1206
01:31:40,594 --> 01:31:43,430
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1207
01:31:44,807 --> 01:31:47,101
And that's the best part.

1208
01:31:47,768 --> 01:31:50,229
She's fucking this prick, see...

1209
01:31:50,437 --> 01:31:53,482
...this golf pro,
but she's married to some other guy.

1210
01:31:54,108 --> 01:31:56,652
Some hotshot banker.

1211
01:31:58,112 --> 01:32:00,614
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1212
01:32:12,084 --> 01:32:15,963
I have to say that's
the most amazing story I ever heard.

1213
01:32:17,214 --> 01:32:19,716
What amazes me most
is you'd be taken in by it.

1214
01:32:20,467 --> 01:32:21,427
Sir?

1215
01:32:23,678 --> 01:32:27,266
It's obvious this fellow Williams
is impressed with you.

1216
01:32:27,850 --> 01:32:31,812
He hears your tale of woe
and naturally wants to cheer you up.

1217
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:34,148
He's young, not terribly bright.

1218
01:32:34,689 --> 01:32:38,151
It's not surprising he wouldn't
know what a state he put you in.

1219
01:32:38,527 --> 01:32:40,112
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1220
01:32:40,862 --> 01:32:45,033
Let's say for the moment
this Blatch does exist.

1221
01:32:45,325 --> 01:32:49,954
You think he'd just fall to his knees
and cry, "Yes, I did it. I confess.

1222
01:32:50,164 --> 01:32:52,833
By the way,
add a life term to my sentence."

1223
01:32:53,041 --> 01:32:55,877
With Tommy's testimony,
I can get a new trial.

1224
01:32:56,043 --> 01:32:58,547
That's assuming Blatch is still there.

1225
01:32:58,756 --> 01:33:00,716
Chances are, he'd be released by now.

1226
01:33:00,883 --> 01:33:03,384
They'd have his last known address.

1227
01:33:03,551 --> 01:33:05,512
It's a chance, isn't it?

1228
01:33:07,848 --> 01:33:09,558
How can you be so obtuse?

1229
01:33:10,516 --> 01:33:11,517
What?

1230
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:14,480
What did you call me?

1231
01:33:14,687 --> 01:33:16,397
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1232
01:33:16,774 --> 01:33:18,274
You're forgetting yourself.

1233
01:33:18,608 --> 01:33:21,570
The country club
will have his old timecards.

1234
01:33:21,736 --> 01:33:24,530
Records, W-2s with his name on them.

1235
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:27,408
If you want to indulge this fantasy,
it's your business.

1236
01:33:27,618 --> 01:33:30,204
Don't make it mine.
This meeting is over.

1237
01:33:30,411 --> 01:33:33,039
If I got out, I'd never mention
what happens here.

1238
01:33:33,665 --> 01:33:36,626
I'd be as indictable as you
for laundering that money.

1239
01:33:38,503 --> 01:33:41,422
Don't ever mention money to me,
you son of a bitch!

1240
01:33:41,632 --> 01:33:43,299
Not in this office...

1241
01:33:43,509 --> 01:33:45,426
...not anywhere.
Get in here, now!

1242
01:33:45,677 --> 01:33:48,388
I just wanted to put you at ease,
that's all.

1243
01:33:49,013 --> 01:33:50,265
Solitary. A month.

1244
01:33:51,265 --> 01:33:52,558
What's wrong with you?

1245
01:33:52,767 --> 01:33:54,102
Get him out of here.

1246
01:33:54,268 --> 01:33:55,853
This is my chance to get out!

1247
01:33:56,063 --> 01:33:57,855
It's my life! Understand?!

1248
01:33:58,064 --> 01:34:00,109
Get him out!

1249
01:34:01,901 --> 01:34:03,862
A month in the hole.

1250
01:34:04,070 --> 01:34:06,740
That's the longest stretch
I ever heard of.

1251
01:34:06,948 --> 01:34:08,282
It's all my fault.

1252
01:34:08,449 --> 01:34:10,077
Bullshit.

1253
01:34:10,743 --> 01:34:13,413
You didn't pull the trigger
or convict him.

1254
01:34:13,621 --> 01:34:16,040
Are you saying Andy is innocent?

1255
01:34:16,249 --> 01:34:18,251
I mean, for real innocent?

1256
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:19,794
It looks that way.

1257
01:34:20,253 --> 01:34:22,130
Sweet Jesus.

1258
01:34:22,422 --> 01:34:24,257
How long has he been here now?

1259
01:34:24,632 --> 01:34:27,927
1947. What is that?
Nineteen years.

1260
01:34:28,137 --> 01:34:30,763
- Williams, Thomas.
- Yeah, over here.

1261
01:34:36,602 --> 01:34:37,770
What you got?

1262
01:34:38,396 --> 01:34:39,731
Board of Education.

1263
01:34:39,939 --> 01:34:41,441
That son of a bitch mailed it.

1264
01:34:41,649 --> 01:34:45,611
You going to open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1265
01:34:45,820 --> 01:34:47,989
Thumb up my butt sounds better.

1266
01:34:48,488 --> 01:34:51,325
Skeets, come on.
Give me that, you shithead.

1267
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,494
Floyd, come on.

1268
01:34:58,958 --> 01:35:01,335
Will you throw that away, please?

1269
01:35:06,966 --> 01:35:08,676
Well, shit.

1270
01:35:21,355 --> 01:35:24,150
The kid passed. C + average.

1271
01:35:24,358 --> 01:35:26,485
Thought you'd like to know.

1272
01:35:42,710 --> 01:35:44,170
Warden wants to talk.

1273
01:35:57,892 --> 01:35:58,975
Out here?

1274
01:35:59,185 --> 01:36:01,396
That's what the man said.

1275
01:36:17,537 --> 01:36:18,538
Warden?

1276
01:36:28,548 --> 01:36:32,592
I'm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

1277
01:36:34,094 --> 01:36:36,388
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1278
01:36:54,824 --> 01:36:56,908
We got a situation here.

1279
01:36:57,784 --> 01:36:59,871
I think you can appreciate that.

1280
01:37:00,078 --> 01:37:01,288
Yes, sir.

1281
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:02,956
I sure can.

1282
01:37:03,248 --> 01:37:07,252
I tell you, son, this thing really
came along and knocked my wind out.

1283
01:37:08,754 --> 01:37:11,298
It's got me up nights.
That's the truth.

1284
01:37:13,593 --> 01:37:15,427
The right thing to do...

1285
01:37:17,095 --> 01:37:20,808
...sometimes it's hard to know
what that is.

1286
01:37:21,808 --> 01:37:23,269
Do you understand?

1287
01:37:25,562 --> 01:37:27,147
I need your help, son.

1288
01:37:28,607 --> 01:37:30,777
If I'm going to move on this...

1289
01:37:31,109 --> 01:37:34,279
...there can't be
the least little shred of doubt.

1290
01:37:34,988 --> 01:37:36,073
I have to know...

1291
01:37:36,281 --> 01:37:38,909
...if what you told Dufresne
was the truth.

1292
01:37:39,117 --> 01:37:40,243
Yes, sir.

1293
01:37:40,451 --> 01:37:41,661
Absolutely.

1294
01:37:42,162 --> 01:37:45,165
Would you be willing to swear
before a judge and jury...

1295
01:37:45,373 --> 01:37:47,375
...with your hand on the Good Book...

1296
01:37:47,584 --> 01:37:50,253
...and take an oath
before Almighty God himself?

1297
01:37:50,462 --> 01:37:52,255
Just give me that chance.

1298
01:37:56,510 --> 01:37:57,844
That's what I thought.

1299
01:38:44,933 --> 01:38:46,852
I'm sure by now you've heard.

1300
01:38:48,602 --> 01:38:49,645
Terrible thing.

1301
01:38:51,230 --> 01:38:52,733
A man that young...

1302
01:38:53,066 --> 01:38:55,652
...less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1303
01:38:56,194 --> 01:38:58,697
Broke Captain Hadley's heart
to shoot him.

1304
01:38:59,406 --> 01:39:00,906
Truly, it did.

1305
01:39:03,909 --> 01:39:06,370
We just have to put it behind us.

1306
01:39:08,039 --> 01:39:09,249
Move on.

1307
01:39:10,875 --> 01:39:12,377
I'm done.

1308
01:39:13,670 --> 01:39:15,297
Everything stops.

1309
01:39:17,256 --> 01:39:19,593
Get someone else to run your scams.

1310
01:39:20,886 --> 01:39:22,720
Nothing stops.

1311
01:39:24,055 --> 01:39:25,223
Nothing.

1312
01:39:28,601 --> 01:39:31,730
Or you will do
the hardest time there is.

1313
01:39:32,104 --> 01:39:34,440
No more protection from the guards.

1314
01:39:34,649 --> 01:39:39,570
I'll pull you out of that 1-bunk Hilton
and cast you down with the sodomites.

1315
01:39:40,946 --> 01:39:43,407
You'll think you've been
fucked by a train.

1316
01:39:44,784 --> 01:39:46,285
And the library?

1317
01:39:46,952 --> 01:39:47,953
Gone.

1318
01:39:48,579 --> 01:39:51,123
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1319
01:39:51,624 --> 01:39:54,251
We'll have us a little
book barbecue in the yard.

1320
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:56,588
They'll see the flames for miles.

1321
01:39:56,796 --> 01:39:59,633
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1322
01:40:00,926 --> 01:40:03,928
You understand me? Catching my drift?

1323
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:09,517
Or am I being obtuse?

1324
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:23,948
Give him another month
to think about it.

1325
01:41:10,702 --> 01:41:13,748
My wife used to say
I'm a hard man to know.

1326
01:41:14,540 --> 01:41:16,375
Like a closed book.

1327
01:41:17,209 --> 01:41:19,210
Complained about it all the time.

1328
01:41:20,171 --> 01:41:21,714
She was beautiful.

1329
01:41:24,132 --> 01:41:25,676
God, I loved her.

1330
01:41:29,388 --> 01:41:31,599
I didn't know how
to show it, that's all.

1331
01:41:34,350 --> 01:41:36,020
I killed her, Red.

1332
01:41:37,897 --> 01:41:39,690
I didn't pull the trigger...

1333
01:41:41,108 --> 01:41:42,860
...but I drove her away.

1334
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:47,031
That's why she died, because of me...

1335
01:41:47,238 --> 01:41:48,616
...the way I am.

1336
01:41:57,624 --> 01:41:59,460
That don't make you a murderer.

1337
01:42:02,837 --> 01:42:04,589
Bad husband, maybe.

1338
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:11,513
Feel bad about it if you want,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1339
01:42:11,722 --> 01:42:13,056
No, I didn't.

1340
01:42:13,432 --> 01:42:15,392
Somebody else did.

1341
01:42:16,602 --> 01:42:18,728
And I wound up in here.

1342
01:42:21,189 --> 01:42:22,774
Bad luck, I guess.

1343
01:42:27,987 --> 01:42:29,447
It floats around.

1344
01:42:30,448 --> 01:42:32,700
It's got to land on somebody.

1345
01:42:33,618 --> 01:42:35,495
It was my turn, that's all.

1346
01:42:36,204 --> 01:42:38,957
I was in the path of the tornado.

1347
01:42:44,922 --> 01:42:48,883
I just didn't expect the storm
would last as long as it has.

1348
01:42:53,221 --> 01:42:54,931
Think you'll ever get out of here?

1349
01:42:56,141 --> 01:42:57,183
Me?

1350
01:43:00,145 --> 01:43:01,146
Yeah.

1351
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,816
One day, when I got
a long, white beard...

1352
01:43:04,983 --> 01:43:08,153
...and two or three marbles
rolling around upstairs.

1353
01:43:10,196 --> 01:43:11,823
I tell you where I'd go.

1354
01:43:13,324 --> 01:43:14,951
Zihuatanejo.

1355
01:43:15,827 --> 01:43:17,036
Say what?

1356
01:43:17,328 --> 01:43:19,164
Zihuatanejo.

1357
01:43:20,123 --> 01:43:21,791
It's in Mexico.

1358
01:43:23,168 --> 01:43:25,295
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1359
01:43:26,421 --> 01:43:29,215
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1360
01:43:31,009 --> 01:43:33,011
They say it has no memory.

1361
01:43:35,013 --> 01:43:37,640
That's where I want to live
the rest of my life.

1362
01:43:39,309 --> 01:43:41,811
A warm place with no memory.

1363
01:43:45,022 --> 01:43:46,983
Open up a little hotel...

1364
01:43:48,693 --> 01:43:50,153
...right on the beach.

1365
01:43:50,779 --> 01:43:52,989
Buy some worthless old boat...

1366
01:43:53,531 --> 01:43:55,158
...and fix it up new.

1367
01:43:57,869 --> 01:43:59,120
Take my guests out...

1368
01:43:59,954 --> 01:44:01,331
...charter fishing.

1369
01:44:05,168 --> 01:44:06,878
Zihuatanejo.

1370
01:44:10,423 --> 01:44:14,302
In a place like that, I could use
a man that knows how to get things.

1371
01:44:20,849 --> 01:44:23,686
I don't think I could make it
on the outside.

1372
01:44:30,359 --> 01:44:32,403
I been in here most of my life.

1373
01:44:33,862 --> 01:44:35,615
I'm an institutional man now.

1374
01:44:36,533 --> 01:44:38,243
Just like Brooks was.

1375
01:44:39,743 --> 01:44:41,413
You underestimate yourself.

1376
01:44:41,996 --> 01:44:43,581
I don't think so.

1377
01:44:47,418 --> 01:44:51,381
In here I'm the guy who can get things
for you, sure, but...

1378
01:44:52,132 --> 01:44:54,675
...outside all you need
is the Yellow Pages.

1379
01:44:54,884 --> 01:44:57,094
Hell, I wouldn't know
where to begin.

1380
01:44:59,263 --> 01:45:00,890
Pacific Ocean?

1381
01:45:01,265 --> 01:45:02,517
Shit.

1382
01:45:02,891 --> 01:45:05,060
Scare me to death,
something that big.

1383
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:06,563
Not me.

1384
01:45:07,771 --> 01:45:10,566
I didn't shoot my wife,
and I didn't shoot her lover.

1385
01:45:12,276 --> 01:45:15,530
Whatever mistakes I made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1386
01:45:16,572 --> 01:45:18,073
That hotel, that boat...

1387
01:45:19,826 --> 01:45:22,077
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1388
01:45:26,957 --> 01:45:29,418
You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.

1389
01:45:29,626 --> 01:45:31,628
This is just shitty pipe dreams.

1390
01:45:32,087 --> 01:45:34,548
Mexico is way down there
and you're in here...

1391
01:45:34,758 --> 01:45:36,301
...and that's the way it is.

1392
01:45:36,633 --> 01:45:39,470
Yeah, right.
That's the way it is.

1393
01:45:40,971 --> 01:45:43,391
It's down there and I'm in here.

1394
01:45:45,977 --> 01:45:48,687
I guess it comes down
to a simple choice.

1395
01:45:51,607 --> 01:45:53,108
Get busy living...

1396
01:45:54,485 --> 01:45:56,487
...or get busy dying.

1397
01:46:08,624 --> 01:46:11,335
If you ever get out of here,
do me a favor.

1398
01:46:11,543 --> 01:46:13,796
Sure, Andy. Anything.

1399
01:46:15,672 --> 01:46:19,551
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1400
01:46:21,011 --> 01:46:24,139
- A lot of hayfields up there.
- One in particular.

1401
01:46:24,348 --> 01:46:28,310
It's got a long rock wall
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1402
01:46:28,519 --> 01:46:31,356
It's like something
out of a Robert Frost poem.

1403
01:46:32,314 --> 01:46:34,816
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1404
01:46:36,193 --> 01:46:38,320
We went there for a picnic...

1405
01:46:38,695 --> 01:46:40,823
...and made love under that oak...

1406
01:46:41,490 --> 01:46:43,700
...and I asked and she said yes.

1407
01:46:47,704 --> 01:46:49,540
Promise me, Red.

1408
01:46:50,374 --> 01:46:51,999
If you ever get out...

1409
01:46:52,209 --> 01:46:53,711
...find that spot.

1410
01:46:54,878 --> 01:46:59,717
At the base of that wall, there's a rock
that has no earthly business in Maine.

1411
01:47:00,884 --> 01:47:03,887
Piece of black, volcanic glass.

1412
01:47:06,557 --> 01:47:09,226
Something's buried under it
I want you to have.

1413
01:47:10,018 --> 01:47:11,227
What, Andy?

1414
01:47:11,687 --> 01:47:13,396
What's buried under there?

1415
01:47:15,023 --> 01:47:16,900
You'll have to pry it up...

1416
01:47:17,067 --> 01:47:18,360
...to see.

1417
01:47:24,241 --> 01:47:26,201
No, I'm telling you. The guy is...

1418
01:47:26,869 --> 01:47:28,579
He's talking funny.

1419
01:47:29,704 --> 01:47:31,373
I'm really worried about him.

1420
01:47:31,790 --> 01:47:33,250
Let's keep an eye on him.

1421
01:47:33,417 --> 01:47:36,712
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's all alone.

1422
01:47:38,130 --> 01:47:39,255
Oh, Lord.

1423
01:47:40,591 --> 01:47:41,424
What?

1424
01:47:42,926 --> 01:47:45,720
Andy come down
to the loading dock today.

1425
01:47:45,929 --> 01:47:48,015
He asked me for a length of rope.

1426
01:47:48,223 --> 01:47:49,057
Rope?

1427
01:47:49,266 --> 01:47:50,893
Six feet long.

1428
01:47:51,143 --> 01:47:52,518
And you gave it to him.

1429
01:47:53,394 --> 01:47:55,189
Sure. Why wouldn't I?

1430
01:47:55,396 --> 01:47:56,940
Jesus! Heywood.

1431
01:47:57,565 --> 01:47:59,526
How was I supposed to know?

1432
01:47:59,734 --> 01:48:01,278
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1433
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:05,239
Andy would never do that.

1434
01:48:05,823 --> 01:48:06,909
Never.

1435
01:48:08,952 --> 01:48:10,286
I don't know.

1436
01:48:13,123 --> 01:48:15,166
Every man has his breaking point.

1437
01:48:17,502 --> 01:48:19,755
Lickety-split.
Want to get home.

1438
01:48:20,088 --> 01:48:21,839
Just about finished, sir.

1439
01:48:38,982 --> 01:48:40,608
Three deposits tonight.

1440
01:48:48,574 --> 01:48:50,493
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1441
01:48:50,661 --> 01:48:52,286
And shine my shoes.

1442
01:48:52,495 --> 01:48:55,456
- I want them looking like mirrors.
- Yes, sir.

1443
01:49:00,962 --> 01:49:02,422
It's good having you back.

1444
01:49:03,339 --> 01:49:05,216
Place wasn't the same without you.

1445
01:49:52,096 --> 01:49:53,181
Lights out!

1446
01:50:26,004 --> 01:50:28,549
I've had some long nights in stir.

1447
01:50:29,092 --> 01:50:31,719
Alone in the dark
with nothing but your thoughts...

1448
01:50:31,927 --> 01:50:34,597
...time can draw out like a blade.

1449
01:50:39,936 --> 01:50:42,939
That was the longest night of my life.

1450
01:50:58,787 --> 01:50:59,955
Give me a count!

1451
01:51:04,460 --> 01:51:07,295
Tier 3 south, clear!

1452
01:51:10,465 --> 01:51:13,594
Man missing on tier 2, cell 245!

1453
01:51:13,802 --> 01:51:14,887
Dufresne!

1454
01:51:15,429 --> 01:51:17,848
Come out. You're holding up the show!

1455
01:51:20,977 --> 01:51:24,397
Don't make me come down
or I'll thump your skull for you!

1456
01:51:31,987 --> 01:51:35,825
Damn it, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

1457
01:51:35,992 --> 01:51:39,287
You'd better be sick or dead in there.
I shit you not!

1458
01:51:39,494 --> 01:51:40,829
You hear me?

1459
01:51:46,961 --> 01:51:49,046
Oh, my Holy God.

1460
01:52:06,022 --> 01:52:08,607
I want every man
on this cellblock questioned.

1461
01:52:09,024 --> 01:52:11,610
- Start with that friend of his.
- Who?

1462
01:52:14,196 --> 01:52:15,739
Open 237.

1463
01:52:19,242 --> 01:52:22,913
What do you mean, "He just wasn't here"?
Don't say that to me.

1464
01:52:23,790 --> 01:52:25,123
Don't tell me that again.

1465
01:52:25,332 --> 01:52:26,333
But sir, he wasn't.

1466
01:52:26,583 --> 01:52:30,045
I can see that, Haig!
Think I'm blind?

1467
01:52:30,712 --> 01:52:32,130
Is that what you're saying?

1468
01:52:32,339 --> 01:52:35,008
- Am I blind, Haig?
- No, sir!

1469
01:52:35,884 --> 01:52:38,387
What about you. You blind?

1470
01:52:38,887 --> 01:52:41,473
- Tell me what this is.
- Last night's count.

1471
01:52:41,681 --> 01:52:44,976
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. Right there.

1472
01:52:45,185 --> 01:52:46,520
"Dufresne."

1473
01:52:48,188 --> 01:52:49,647
He was in his cell...

1474
01:52:49,898 --> 01:52:50,857
...at lights out.

1475
01:52:51,066 --> 01:52:53,318
Reasonable he'd be here in the morning.

1476
01:52:54,361 --> 01:52:55,986
I want him found.

1477
01:52:56,196 --> 01:52:59,658
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!

1478
01:52:59,907 --> 01:53:01,076
Yes, sir.

1479
01:53:02,076 --> 01:53:04,370
Let's go. Move your butts.

1480
01:53:07,749 --> 01:53:08,750
Stand.

1481
01:53:10,210 --> 01:53:11,253
Well?

1482
01:53:14,715 --> 01:53:15,674
Well, what?

1483
01:53:15,923 --> 01:53:19,385
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1484
01:53:20,428 --> 01:53:21,930
He must have said something.

1485
01:53:22,681 --> 01:53:24,224
No, sir, Warden.

1486
01:53:24,598 --> 01:53:25,559
Not a word.

1487
01:53:27,394 --> 01:53:29,937
Lord, it's a miracle!

1488
01:53:30,564 --> 01:53:33,107
Man vanished like a fart in the wind.

1489
01:53:33,775 --> 01:53:34,943
Nothing left...

1490
01:53:35,777 --> 01:53:38,530
...but some damn rocks
on a windowsill.

1491
01:53:38,738 --> 01:53:41,450
And that cupcake on the wall.
Let's ask her.

1492
01:53:41,657 --> 01:53:43,410
Maybe she knows.

1493
01:53:43,659 --> 01:53:46,412
What say there, fuzzy-britches?
Feel like talking?

1494
01:53:47,830 --> 01:53:49,123
Guess not.

1495
01:53:49,707 --> 01:53:51,917
Why should she be any different?

1496
01:53:52,961 --> 01:53:54,628
This is a conspiracy.

1497
01:53:55,297 --> 01:53:57,089
That's what this is.

1498
01:53:57,716 --> 01:54:01,427
One big, damn conspiracy!

1499
01:54:01,719 --> 01:54:03,721
And everyone's in on it!

1500
01:54:04,346 --> 01:54:05,515
Including her!

1501
01:54:40,549 --> 01:54:42,259
In 1966...

1502
01:54:42,468 --> 01:54:44,846
...Andy Dufresne escaped...

1503
01:54:45,054 --> 01:54:46,639
...from Shawshank Prison.

1504
01:54:48,849 --> 01:54:51,435
All they found
was a muddy set of prison clothes...

1505
01:54:52,062 --> 01:54:53,604
...a bar of soap...

1506
01:54:53,813 --> 01:54:55,356
...and an old rock hammer...

1507
01:54:55,564 --> 01:54:58,025
...damn near worn down to the nub.

1508
01:55:02,530 --> 01:55:07,326
I had thought it'd take a man 600 years
to tunnel through the wall with it.

1509
01:55:07,953 --> 01:55:10,579
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1510
01:55:28,890 --> 01:55:31,183
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1511
01:55:31,934 --> 01:55:35,105
I imagine it appealed to his
meticulous nature.

1512
01:55:35,521 --> 01:55:37,356
An ice age here...

1513
01:55:37,773 --> 01:55:40,276
...million years
of mountain building there.

1514
01:55:41,277 --> 01:55:44,113
Geology is the study
of pressure and time.

1515
01:55:44,947 --> 01:55:46,948
That's all it takes, really.

1516
01:55:47,700 --> 01:55:48,784
Pressure...

1517
01:55:49,410 --> 01:55:50,702
...and time.

1518
01:55:52,038 --> 01:55:54,081
That and a big goddamn poster.

1519
01:55:58,127 --> 01:55:59,085
Like I said...

1520
01:55:59,587 --> 01:56:03,548
...in prison, a man will do anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1521
01:56:06,385 --> 01:56:11,182
Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting
his wall out into the exercise yard...

1522
01:56:11,724 --> 01:56:13,642
...a handful at a time.

1523
01:56:14,935 --> 01:56:17,021
I guess after Tommy was killed...

1524
01:56:17,229 --> 01:56:20,191
...Andy decided
he'd been here long enough.

1525
01:56:20,399 --> 01:56:22,943
Lickety-split.
I want to get home.

1526
01:56:23,694 --> 01:56:25,738
I'm just about finished, sir.

1527
01:56:47,175 --> 01:56:49,136
Three deposits tonight.

1528
01:56:56,434 --> 01:56:58,728
Andy did like he was told.

1529
01:56:58,938 --> 01:57:02,400
Buffed those shoes
to a high mirror-shine.

1530
01:57:06,111 --> 01:57:08,405
The guards simply didn't notice.

1531
01:57:08,696 --> 01:57:10,156
Neither did I.

1532
01:57:10,366 --> 01:57:11,908
I mean, seriously...

1533
01:57:12,118 --> 01:57:15,121
...how often do you really look
at a man's shoes?

1534
01:59:18,660 --> 01:59:21,830
Andy crawled to freedom
through 500 yards...

1535
01:59:22,079 --> 01:59:25,416
...of shit-smelling foulness
I can't even imagine.

1536
01:59:26,417 --> 01:59:28,752
Or maybe I just don't want to.

1537
01:59:33,133 --> 01:59:35,509
Five hundred yards.

1538
01:59:36,010 --> 01:59:39,097
That's the length
of five football fields.

1539
01:59:39,722 --> 01:59:42,267
Just shy of half a mile.

1540
02:00:37,529 --> 02:00:42,117
The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her secret...

1541
02:00:42,409 --> 02:00:45,245
...a man nobody ever
laid eyes on before...

1542
02:00:45,497 --> 02:00:48,082
...strolled into
the Maine National Bank.

1543
02:00:48,666 --> 02:00:51,835
Until that moment,
he didn't exist.

1544
02:00:52,378 --> 02:00:54,756
- Except on paper.
- May I help you?

1545
02:00:55,173 --> 02:00:57,091
He had all the proper ID...

1546
02:00:57,299 --> 02:01:01,011
...driver's license, birth certificate,
Social Security card...

1547
02:01:01,428 --> 02:01:03,972
And the signature
was a spot-on match.

1548
02:01:04,181 --> 02:01:07,267
I must say I'm sorry
to be losing your business.

1549
02:01:07,476 --> 02:01:09,186
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1550
02:01:10,020 --> 02:01:11,105
Thank you.

1551
02:01:11,772 --> 02:01:12,940
I'm sure I will.

1552
02:01:13,857 --> 02:01:17,194
Here's your cashier's check, sir.
Will there be anything else?

1553
02:01:17,403 --> 02:01:18,362
Please.

1554
02:01:18,946 --> 02:01:21,448
Would you add this
to your outgoing mail?

1555
02:01:21,949 --> 02:01:23,158
I'd be happy to.

1556
02:01:24,952 --> 02:01:26,286
Good day, sir.

1557
02:01:27,246 --> 02:01:31,667
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the Portland area that morning.

1558
02:01:32,126 --> 02:01:33,711
All told, he blew town...

1559
02:01:33,919 --> 02:01:38,757
...with better than $370,000
of Warden Norton's money.

1560
02:01:39,466 --> 02:01:42,219
Severance pay for 19 years.

1561
02:01:49,476 --> 02:01:51,687
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1562
02:02:44,530 --> 02:02:47,493
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

1563
02:02:47,743 --> 02:02:52,163
If you give up this right, anything you
say can be held against you in court.

1564
02:02:52,622 --> 02:02:57,085
I wasn't there to see, but I hear
Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...

1565
02:02:57,294 --> 02:02:58,754
...when they took him away.

1566
02:03:04,676 --> 02:03:08,054
Norton had no intention
of going that quietly.

1567
02:03:23,904 --> 02:03:24,738
Samuel Norton.

1568
02:03:25,530 --> 02:03:27,990
We have a warrant
for your arrest. Open up.

1569
02:03:32,705 --> 02:03:33,830
Open the door.

1570
02:03:34,372 --> 02:03:35,623
I'm not sure which key.

1571
02:03:45,758 --> 02:03:47,720
Make it easy on yourself, Norton!

1572
02:03:59,230 --> 02:04:02,650
I like to think the last thing
that went through his head...

1573
02:04:02,900 --> 02:04:04,486
...other than that bullet...

1574
02:04:04,694 --> 02:04:09,115
...was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1575
02:04:11,617 --> 02:04:15,079
Not long after the warden
deprived us of his company...

1576
02:04:15,371 --> 02:04:17,415
...I got a postcard in the mail.

1577
02:04:18,917 --> 02:04:21,711
It was blank,
but the postmark said...

1578
02:04:21,919 --> 02:04:24,047
...Fort Hancock, Texas.

1579
02:04:24,589 --> 02:04:25,965
Fort Hancock...

1580
02:04:26,257 --> 02:04:27,967
...right on the border.

1581
02:04:28,384 --> 02:04:30,344
That's where Andy crossed.

1582
02:04:30,928 --> 02:04:35,058
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down...

1583
02:04:35,433 --> 02:04:37,643
...it always makes me laugh.

1584
02:04:39,479 --> 02:04:41,064
Andy Dufresne...

1585
02:04:41,439 --> 02:04:43,441
...who crawled through
a river of shit...

1586
02:04:43,649 --> 02:04:46,069
...and came out clean
on the other side.

1587
02:04:46,903 --> 02:04:48,236
Andy Dufresne...

1588
02:04:49,072 --> 02:04:50,656
...headed for the Pacific.

1589
02:04:53,618 --> 02:04:55,787
Hadley's got him
by the throat, right?

1590
02:04:55,995 --> 02:04:59,790
He says, "I believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident."

1591
02:04:59,999 --> 02:05:02,877
Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

1592
02:05:03,543 --> 02:05:05,254
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

1593
02:05:05,463 --> 02:05:08,424
"My friends could use
a couple of beers."

1594
02:05:08,757 --> 02:05:10,426
And he got it!

1595
02:05:11,635 --> 02:05:14,055
Sometimes it makes me sad, though...

1596
02:05:14,305 --> 02:05:15,765
...Andy being gone.

1597
02:05:16,474 --> 02:05:20,602
I have to remind myself that
some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1598
02:05:21,062 --> 02:05:23,106
Their feathers are just too bright.

1599
02:05:24,816 --> 02:05:26,567
And when they fly away...

1600
02:05:26,984 --> 02:05:31,406
...the part of you that knows it was
a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1601
02:05:32,490 --> 02:05:33,740
But still...

1602
02:05:34,199 --> 02:05:38,538
...the place you live in is that much
more drab and empty that they're gone.

1603
02:05:42,750 --> 02:05:45,127
I guess I just miss my friend.

1604
02:06:09,818 --> 02:06:10,736
Please sit down.

1605
02:06:16,576 --> 02:06:18,161
Ellis Boyd Redding...

1606
02:06:18,702 --> 02:06:21,955
...your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1607
02:06:22,748 --> 02:06:24,875
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1608
02:06:26,752 --> 02:06:28,336
Rehabilitated?

1609
02:06:30,380 --> 02:06:32,257
Well, now, let me see.

1610
02:06:33,258 --> 02:06:35,594
I don't have any idea
what that means.

1611
02:06:37,721 --> 02:06:39,974
It means you're ready
to rejoin society-

1612
02:06:40,558 --> 02:06:42,852
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1613
02:06:45,062 --> 02:06:47,022
To me it's just a made-up word.

1614
02:06:48,398 --> 02:06:50,692
A politician's word so that...

1615
02:06:51,151 --> 02:06:54,697
...young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie...

1616
02:06:55,155 --> 02:06:56,740
...and have a job.

1617
02:06:58,743 --> 02:07:00,827
What do you really want to know?

1618
02:07:01,578 --> 02:07:03,580
Am I sorry for what I did?

1619
02:07:03,997 --> 02:07:05,165
Well, are you?

1620
02:07:07,084 --> 02:07:09,878
There's not a day goes by
I don't feel regret.

1621
02:07:11,254 --> 02:07:14,716
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1622
02:07:18,220 --> 02:07:20,764
I look back on the way I was then...

1623
02:07:22,933 --> 02:07:24,059
...a young...

1624
02:07:25,185 --> 02:07:28,688
...stupid kid who committed
that terrible crime.

1625
02:07:31,691 --> 02:07:33,402
I want to talk to him.

1626
02:07:35,320 --> 02:07:37,781
I want to try
and talk some sense to him.

1627
02:07:38,532 --> 02:07:40,450
Tell him the way things are.

1628
02:07:42,577 --> 02:07:43,995
But I can't.

1629
02:07:46,206 --> 02:07:48,208
That kid's long gone...

1630
02:07:49,418 --> 02:07:52,170
...and this old man is all that's left.

1631
02:07:53,588 --> 02:07:55,048
I got to live with that.

1632
02:07:56,425 --> 02:07:58,093
Rehabilitated?

1633
02:07:58,468 --> 02:08:00,303
It's just a bullshit word.

1634
02:08:01,263 --> 02:08:06,017
So you go on and stamp your forms,
sonny, and stop wasting my time.

1635
02:08:07,269 --> 02:08:09,520
Because to tell you the truth...

1636
02:08:09,855 --> 02:08:11,857
...I don't give a shit.

1637
02:09:38,401 --> 02:09:39,777
Here you go, miss.

1638
02:09:42,738 --> 02:09:43,739
Restroom break?

1639
02:09:49,578 --> 02:09:54,083
You don't need to ask me every time
you need to go take a piss. Just go.

1640
02:10:07,138 --> 02:10:10,224
Forty years I've been asking
permission to piss.

1641
02:10:11,058 --> 02:10:14,019
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1642
02:10:17,565 --> 02:10:19,734
There's a harsh truth to face.

1643
02:10:21,402 --> 02:10:24,280
No way I'm going to make it
on the outside.

1644
02:10:32,163 --> 02:10:35,875
All I do anymore is think of ways
to break my parole...

1645
02:10:36,667 --> 02:10:39,128
...so maybe they'd send me back.

1646
02:10:44,341 --> 02:10:46,802
Terrible thing, to live in fear.

1647
02:10:47,678 --> 02:10:49,345
Brooks Hatlen knew it.

1648
02:10:49,555 --> 02:10:51,474
Knew it all too well.

1649
02:10:53,099 --> 02:10:56,479
All I want is to be back
where things make sense.

1650
02:10:56,937 --> 02:10:59,648
Where I won't have to be afraid
all the time.

1651
02:11:01,650 --> 02:11:04,028
Only one thing stops me.

1652
02:11:05,488 --> 02:11:07,865
A promise I made to Andy.

1653
02:11:28,386 --> 02:11:29,511
There it is.

1654
02:11:40,147 --> 02:11:41,816
Much obliged, sir.

1655
02:15:21,116 --> 02:15:22,369
Dear Red:

1656
02:15:22,619 --> 02:15:25,080
If you're reading this,
you've gotten out...

1657
02:15:25,287 --> 02:15:29,375
...and if you've come this far,
maybe you'd come a bit further.

1658
02:15:29,625 --> 02:15:32,086
You remember the name
of the town, don't you?

1659
02:15:34,421 --> 02:15:35,881
Zihuatanejo.

1660
02:15:37,549 --> 02:15:41,137
I could use a good man
to help me get my project on wheels.

1661
02:15:41,637 --> 02:15:45,183
I'll keep an eye out for you,
and the chessboard ready.

1662
02:15:45,974 --> 02:15:47,393
Remember, Red...

1663
02:15:47,726 --> 02:15:49,812
...hope is a good thing...

1664
02:15:50,020 --> 02:15:52,022
...maybe the best of things.

1665
02:15:52,232 --> 02:15:54,401
And no good thing ever dies.

1666
02:15:54,942 --> 02:15:57,778
I will be hoping
that this letter finds you...

1667
02:15:57,986 --> 02:15:59,738
...and finds you well.

1668
02:16:00,239 --> 02:16:01,448
Your friend...

1669
02:16:01,657 --> 02:16:02,825
...Andy.

1670
02:16:36,650 --> 02:16:38,402
"Get busy living...

1671
02:16:38,610 --> 02:16:40,486
...or get busy dying."

1672
02:16:43,198 --> 02:16:45,367
That's goddamn right.

1673
02:16:50,622 --> 02:16:52,750
For the second time in my life...

1674
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,544
...I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1675
02:16:56,628 --> 02:16:58,546
Parole violation.

1676
02:16:59,214 --> 02:17:02,884
Of course I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

1677
02:17:03,552 --> 02:17:05,596
Not for an old crook like me.

1678
02:17:05,804 --> 02:17:07,806
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1679
02:17:11,518 --> 02:17:16,231
I find I'm so excited I can barely
sit still or hold a thought in my head.

1680
02:17:16,690 --> 02:17:19,985
I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.

1681
02:17:20,193 --> 02:17:22,696
A free man at the start
of a long journey...

1682
02:17:22,905 --> 02:17:25,491
...whose conclusion is uncertain.

1683
02:17:28,535 --> 02:17:31,162
I hope I can make it across the border.

1684
02:17:32,706 --> 02:17:35,709
I hope to see my friend
and shake his hand.

1685
02:17:37,586 --> 02:17:41,673
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

1686
02:17:43,509 --> 02:17:44,676
I hope.
